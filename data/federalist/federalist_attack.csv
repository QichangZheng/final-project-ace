Welcome to Neoconworld,"Twelve years after the September 11 attacks, threats of American involvement in Syria’s civil war have refocused attention on the region at the heart of our foreign policy: the Greater Middle East. By “Greater Middle East” I mean not only the Arab-Muslim heartland of the Arabian Peninsula, Mesopotamia, and the Levant, but the broader region stretching from Morocco in the west to Pakistan in the east, from Turkey in the north to Yemen in the south (with the exception, of course, of Israel). Many of the countries in the region are not Arab – Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan – but all are predominantly Muslim, and all are infected to one extent or another with the ideology of Islamism, built around the view that Muslims constitute a pan-national political entity and not merely a religious confession.

For the past five years, U.S. foreign policy has been made by senior elected officials and political appointees who, in the words of the Boston Globe, “built careers on [an] anti-war posture.” And yet, our policy in the Greater Middle East remains impervious to new strategic initiatives that seek to fundamentally alter the “neoconservative” course set by the Bush Administration. And while that much-used term is often abused or misunderstood, the policy it describes has taken on a life of its own. It’s still the neocons’ world, and everyone else is living in it. And the jury is still out on how it will end.

But this much is already clear: the old status quo is gone and cannot be reconstructed. The biggest loser in the post-September 11 world has been established order of a region previously dominated by Muslim and Arab strongmen who (while they might be seen as religious zealots by Western standards) sought to ground their rule on secular concepts like nationalism, who ran stable, tightly controlled police states and engaged in traditional power politics, and who successfully projected the internal tensions of their repressed societies outwards. The forces of popular change have come to the region, and for good or ill, they will not be denied. The harder question is what replaces the old order.

Digging To The Roots

Writ small, the September 11 attacks were a conspiracy by Al Qaeda – a terrorist group based in Afghanistan, Germany, and to a lesser extent Egypt and Pakistan, and consisting largely of Saudi Wahabbist Muslim fanatics – to attack civilian targets in the United States. Some observers argued from the beginning that we should focus on the conspirators and their organization, and forego broader ambitions.

The Bush Administration never treated the attacks simply as a criminal conspiracy to be isolated and punished, instead preferring to treat Al Qaeda as a symptom of a wider problem, and to seek out a solution that required digging deeper into the region’s pathologies in the effort to root out the entire problem once and for all. That approach recognized the reality that the organization of jihadist extremist groups was fungible; Al Qaeda was simply one manifestation of a larger movement. Al Qaeda’s own recent behavior illustrates this reality: holding a coordinated conference call with other extremist and terrorist groups that one intelligence professional described as akin to the “Legion of Doom”; current Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri calling publicly for more locally organized terror attacks like the Boston Marathon Bombing; radical imam Anwar al-Awlaki giving Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hasan the ideological encouragement to conduct a lone jihadist attack on an American military base.

The nearly unanimous decision to go to war in Afghanistan was made without real discussion of what our broader goals were, but the war in Iraq nearly a year and a half later forced the question into the open. Even with the publication of memoirs by most of the major players, we have never really had a full, candid accounting of the grand-strategic thinking of President Bush and his team between September 2001 and March 2003. Bush, in his own memoir, summarized his principles in four points:

First, make no distinction between the terrorists and the nations that harbor them – and hold both to account. Second, take the fight to the enemy overseas before they can attack us here at home again. Third, confront threats before they fully materialize. And fourth, advance liberty and hope as an alternative to the enemy’s ideology of repression and fear.

That fourth point was the source of the high-flying rhetoric about liberty and democracy and its connection to security in his Second Inaugural Address in 2005:

We have seen our vulnerability – and we have seen its deepest source. For as long as whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny – prone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder – violence will gather, and multiply in destructive power, and cross the most defended borders, and raise a mortal threat. There is only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment, and expose the pretensions of tyrants, and reward the hopes of the decent and tolerant, and that is the force of human freedom. We are led, by events and common sense, to one conclusion: The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world. …So it is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world. This is not primarily the task of arms, though we will defend ourselves and our friends by force of arms when necessary. Freedom, by its nature, must be chosen…

What was missing from all this was an explanation of how we planned to get to that end – precisely who the enemy was and is, and what our strategic philosophy would be in deciding when to use force, when to declare the mission accomplished, when to coexist with dictators who cooperated against the jihadists, and when to support insurrections that were aligned with them. Both Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld, in their memoirs, stressed the importance of stepping back and doing strategic thinking even in the bustle of war, but despite their respect for Bush, both memoirs have a little edge of regret that more such thinking wasn’t done from the top in a public way that would have given clearer direction to the missions in Afghanistan and Iraq.

The ultimate historic judgment of the Iraq War must be bound up with the eventual success or failure of the grand strategy it represented.

But just because the strategy wasn’t explicitly stated as such doesn’t mean a course wasn’t set. When the Bush Administration’s actions are considered in light of the thinking of conservative commentators and the justifications offered then and now, it seems clear that the Administration came, rather early, to the conclusion that the problem was the fundamental structure of the Greater Middle East (at a minimum its political structure). Because the solution to such a problem is not merely to launch missiles or drop bombs, but to change the governments of the region – a much more ambitious goal – it inherently required kick-starting the process by choosing a country to make an example. The obvious choice, for a variety of reasons, was Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, with which we already had continuous hostilities dating back a decade; the U.S. Congress had already, in 1998, declared a change in Iraq’s regime to be official U.S. policy. Regardless of the specific arguments made for the invasion of Iraq at the time, the ultimate historic judgment of the Iraq War must be bound up with the eventual success or failure of the grand strategy it represented, just as the ultimate worth of the sacrifices made in Korea and Vietnam are now subsumed in the larger context of the success of the Cold War.

The Nail Beckons The Hammer

President Bush’s “freedom agenda” came to be identified with the neoconservatives, an anti-communist movement dating back to the 1960s, in large part because when the planes hit the towers, the prominent ‘neocon’ thinkers in and out of government were the ones most ready with an off-the-shelf explanation for how you deal with such a problem, and their template resembled what ended up being put in practice in Iraq and Afghanistan. An accurate history of neoconservatism is too broad a subject for this essay, but it was merely one of several strands of thought on the Right that came to similar conclusions about the Cold War by the time of the Reagan era: that the struggle with Soviet Communism was an ideological one, an important component of which was demonstrating to its captive peoples and those on the fence that our system was superior in delivering a good way of life; that they should be encouraged to undermine and ultimately reject their home governments; and that we would not abandon them no matter how long that struggle took. This broad-based view that the Cold War could be won by rooting out the origins of the conflict had won out over the narrower model of containment that focused on dealing with specific provocations as they arose.

The virtue of the neoconservative model was that it had been proven as part of a long-term ideological struggle that succeeded beyond our wildest dreams by the early 1990s; we had won the Cold War without fighting a full-scale war with the Soviets, ushering in a massive global expansion of democracy and trade. Even Putin’s Russia, troublesome as it is, looks more or less like a success story compared to the Brezhnev era – and it looked better in 2002 than it does today. But the parallels were not perfect or entirely encouraging: the Cold War had taken 45 years to win, it had involved a huge, costly military and economic strategy that could not easily be adapted to an adversary that consisted of a loose confederation of non-state-actors and states allied only by convenience, and – perhaps most alarmingly of all – a key ally in the Cold War was the religious faith of Catholic, Orthodox and Muslim subjects oppressed by the atheistic Soviet empire, whereas the battle against Islamism would require convincing millions of Muslims to re-evaluate political doctrines that many of them believed were taught by their faith.

Moreover, the history of the neoconservative model in and before the Cold War offers its own cautions. Ideological competition presupposes populations that have sufficient freedom of action to do something about their governments, or (in the case of Japan between 1850 and 1900) a government that itself sees the benefits of change. Churchill dedicated extensive resources to fomenting rebellion against the Nazis during World War II – he famously directed the Special Operations Executive to “set Europe ablaze” – but the resistance movements in places like Poland and Greece were brutally suppressed; as historian John Keegan concluded from a review of the SOE’s operations, most had little impact on the stability of the Nazi occupation. Only external Allied military force was able to crush Hitler. Only the Union Army, rather than slave rebellions, defeated the Confederacy. The French Revolutionaries were rarely able to subvert their monarchical adversaries and had to meet them on a conventional field of battle. Since the dawn of the West, the history of civilizational clashes is long on the use of military force to defend and expand Western Civilization and short on the peaceable conversion of its enemies. Even in the Cold War, the U.S. was compelled to take to the battlefield to protect the populations of South Korea and South Vietnam from conquest.

The Jacksonian impulse: avoid meddling in the world until provoked, then respond with as much brute force as necessary to convince everyone not to get us that angry again.

The neoconservative approach to post-9/11 strategy was not the only one on offer on the Right. On the one hand was the “realist” approach, redolent of containment, that counseled working with the existing regimes in the region to ally against the non-state-actors and bring the bad-actor states in line. The realist school on the Right, preaching power politics, is in this sense often allied with the school on the Left that preaches the maintenance of order by international institutions (an approach that has regained its footing with the passage of time, but which was plainly inadequate to the task of organizing a response in the aftermath of an event like September 11). On the other was the “Jacksonian” approach. Put bluntly, the Jacksonian impulse is to avoid meddling in the world until provoked, and then respond with as much brute force as necessary to convince everyone, innocent or guilty of the attacks, not to get us that angry again. Jacksonians were thus in favor of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, but not in favor of sticking around long-term to clean up the mess.

Bush’s foreign policy team was by no means ideologically monolithic (just as Reagan’s was not); Dick Cheney, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice all hailed more or less from the realpolitik school of thought that prevailed under George H.W. Bush (although many of Cheney’s old aides, back in government, were identified with neoconservatism), and if you ever described Don Rumsfeld as a “neo” anything, you deserve to have your pundit card revoked. But then, in many ways the decision to seek a more structural, long-term solution was as much a product of Bush’s personality and temperament as any ideology. Bush had come into office believing in decisiveness and the use of political capital for large goals and distasteful of half-measures and short-term “kick the can down the road” solutions, and when possible, he naturally gravitated towards bold strokes. Setting the United States the ambitious task of igniting a regional revolution in the Greater Middle East would put all of these impulses into action.

Two Blog Perspectives

To understand the logic of the neoconservative project, it is worth looking back at two essays written at the time from opposite ends of the political spectrum, one on a right-leaning blog, the other for a left-leaning magazine.

Probably the most influential blog essay of the War on Terror was the “Strategic Overview” written in July 2003 by Steven Den Beste. It is interesting and telling, looking back, how much of Den Beste’s analysis and that of others on the Right at the time rested more on Arab culture than Islam, although its logic extends to the wider region. Den Beste’s essential argument was that we were dealing with a body of people that was (1) stuck in a constellation of failed states and a failed culture, (2) deeply ashamed by that fact, and (3) lacking either the will to face that fact or a political outlet in which to do something about it, and therefore were (4) encouraged to vent their rage and frustrations at those outside the Muslim and Arab worlds. Den Beste’s prescription was to break down the political order of the Arab/Muslim world and replace it with something more responsive to popular needs, demands and aspirations. An ambitious project, but one in line with the longstanding conservative view that men can change governments more easily than governments can change men. As Den Beste explained:

The large solution is to reform the Arab/Muslim world. This is the path we have chosen. The true root cause of the war is their failure and their resentment and frustration and shame caused by that failure. They fail because they are crippled by political, cultural and religious chains which their extremists refuse to give up. The real causes of their failure is well described by Ralph Peters. Most of the Arab nations suffer from all seven of his critical handicaps, and the goal of reform is to correct all seven, as far as possible. If their governments can be reformed, and their people freed of the chains which bind them and cripple them, they will begin to achieve, and to become proud of their accomplishments. This will reduce and eventually eliminate their resentment. Their governments would then cease needing scapegoats. Their extremists would no longer have fertile ground for recruitment. This is a huge undertaking; it will require decades because it won’t really be complete until there’s a generational turnover. But ultimately it is the only way to really eliminate the danger to us without using the “foot-and-mouth” solution (which is to say, nuclear genocide). The primary purpose of reform is to liberate individual Arabs. This is a humanist reform, but it isn’t a Christian reform. There will be no attempt to eradicate Islam as a religion. Rather, Islamism as a political movement, and as a body of law, and as a form of government must be eliminated, leaving Islam as a religion largely untouched except to the extent that it will be forced to be tolerant. The conceptual model for this is what we did in Japan after WWII, where only those cultural elements which were dangerous to us were eliminated, leaving behind a nation which was less aggressive, but still Japanese. No attempt was made to make Japan a clone of the US, and no such attempt will be made with the Arabs.

In Den Beste’s view, it was essential that “we had to conquer one of the big antagonistic Arab nations and take control of it” for the following purposes:

To place us in a physical and logistical position to be able to apply substantial pressure on the rest of the major governments of the region. To force them to stop protecting and supporting terrorist groups To force them to begin implementing political and social reforms To convince the governments and other leaders of the region that it was no longer fashionable to blame us for their failure, so that they would stop using us as scapegoats. To make clear to everyone in the world that reform is coming, whether they like it or not, and that the old policy of stability-for-the-sake-of-stability is dead. To make clear to local leaders that they may only choose between reforming voluntarily or having reform forced on them. To make a significant long term change in the psychology of the “Arab Street” To prove to the “Arab Street” that we were willing to fight, and that our reputation for cowardice was undeserved. To prove that we are extraordinarily dangerous when we do fight, and that it is extremely unwise to provoke us. To defeat the spirit of the “Arab Street”. To force them to face their own failure, so that they would become willing to consider the idea that reform could lead them to success. No one can solve a problem until they acknowledge that they have a problem, and until now the “Arab Street” has been hiding from theirs, in part aided by government propaganda eager to blame others elsewhere (especially the Jews). To “nation build”. After making the “Arab Street” truly face its own failure, to show the “Arab Street” a better way by creating a secularized, liberated, cosmopolitan society in a core Arab nation. To create a place where Arabs were free, safe, unafraid, happy and successful. To show that this could be done without dictators or monarchs. (I’ve been referring to this as being the pilot project for “Arab Civilization 2.0”.) …Neither Afghanistan nor Iran would serve the political goals. The conquered nation had to be one generally thought of as being Arab. The human and cultural material we needed for reform did not exist in Afghanistan. The “Arab Street” would not have been impressed by successful reform in Afghanistan or in Persian Iran.

In addition to Iraq’s strategic location and the various casi belli already in existence (also beyond the scope of this essay, but worth revisiting at another time with the distance of a decade), he also noted the important symbolic reasons why Iraq was well-suited to this project:

Saddam had become a hero to the “Arab Street”. He was thought of as a strong Arab leader who was standing up to the West. Though Iraq’s military had been decisively defeated in 1991, Saddam survived politically and this actually enhanced his reputation. He hadn’t won against us, but at least he’d tried, which was better than anyone else seemed to be doing. The “Arab Street” was proud of him for making the attempt. (This involved a lot of revisionism, such as ignoring Saddam’s earlier invasion of Kuwait, or the participation of large Arab military forces in the coalition army which fought against Iraq.) Iraq’s military had the reputation of being the largest, best armed and most dangerous of any in the region. If it could be decisively crushed it would be psychologically devastating. Baghdad historically was one of the great capitals of classic Arab civilization. Having it fall to outsiders would be symbolically important.

I would add that Iraq’s religious and ethnic diversity (the very thing that caused Joe Biden to argue for it being partitioned into three separate states) also presented both a challenge and an opportunity. A challenge, because of the sectarian tensions between Sunni and Shia that would break into something resembling a full-blown civil war in 2006, but also an opportunity, because Iraq could not be unified along monosectarian lines; it needed, and continues to need, some tolerance of pluralism within Islam to function as a single state, some mechanism for enabling tolerance and co-existence.

From the opposite end of the political spectrum, Josh Marshall, writing in April 2003, concluded essentially the same thing about the Bush Administration’s strategy, a strategy he found deeply troubling. He described his nightmare for the aftermath of toppling Saddam:

The United Nations and NATO are in disarray, so America is pretty much on its own. Hemmed in by budget deficits at home and limited financial assistance from allies, the Bush administration is talking again about tapping Iraq’s oil reserves to offset some of the costs of the American presence–talk that is further inflaming the region. Meanwhile, U.S. intelligence has discovered fresh evidence that, prior to the war, Saddam moved quantities of biological and chemical weapons to Syria. When Syria denies having such weapons, the administration starts massing troops on the Syrian border. But as they begin to move, there is an explosion: Hezbollah terrorists from southern Lebanon blow themselves up in a Baghdad restaurant, killing dozens of Western aid workers and journalists. Knowing that Hezbollah has cells in America, Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge puts the nation back on Orange Alert. FBI agents start sweeping through mosques, with a new round of arrests of Saudis, Pakistanis, Palestinians, and Yemenis. To most Americans, this would sound like a frightening state of affairs, the kind that would lead them to wonder how and why we had got ourselves into this mess in the first place. But to the Bush administration hawks who are guiding American foreign policy, this isn’t the nightmare scenario. It’s everything going as anticipated.

Marshall concluded that, in the view of hawks within the Administration,

[I]nvasion of Iraq was not merely, or even primarily, about getting rid of Saddam Hussein. Nor was it really about weapons of mass destruction, though their elimination was an important benefit. Rather, the administration sees the invasion as only the first move in a wider effort to reorder the power structure of the entire Middle East…. [T]he administration is trying to roll the table–to use U.S. military force, or the threat of it, to reform or topple virtually every regime in the region, from foes like Syria to friends like Egypt, on the theory that it is the undemocratic nature of these regimes that ultimately breeds terrorism. So events that may seem negative–Hezbollah for the first time targeting American civilians; U.S. soldiers preparing for war with Syria–while unfortunate in themselves, are actually part of the hawks’ broader agenda.

Eight years later, events have long since taken on a life of their own, and while they have followed neither the precise outline of Den Beste’s positive or Marshall’s negative view, the essential trajectory has been the one projected: disruption of the long-ossified status quo and the ushering in of a revolutionary era that has replaced one longstanding tryanny after another with something different and (in the short run) more responsive to popular movements.

Set The Greater Middle East Ablaze

The Bush Administration was fond of touting the milestones of democracy and freedom (the two things are not the same), and in the early years they came in waves. At the same time, the forces of chaos threatened to overwhelm the progress. But as the years have passed, chaos has more often engulfed the enemies of democracy than its friends. Step back and consider the timeline of major events – not every battle or controversy, but the large-scale shifts between democracy, tyranny and extremism:

Along the way, especially in 2011, we’ve seen more modest protests and reforms or crackdowns in places like Morocco, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.

Compare all of that to the face of the region in September 2001 – dominated by a few theocratic regimes (Iran and Taliban Afghanistan), a handful of Gulf monarchies, and a long row of strongmen – and you can see how far the project of remaking the face of the region has progressed. By no means is the news all good, but it’s all news compared to the statis that characterized the internal politics of most of the region before 9/11.

The Iraq War dominated U.S. political discussion for the greater part of five and a half years from mid-2002 to late 2007, and Americans have a tendency to focus on how the war affected our politics and foreign opinion of us. But it also gripped the attention of the Greater Middle East, dominating al Jazeera’s regional programming. For would-be democratic reformers, the scenes of voters lining up at the polls and even of squabbling parliamentarians in Iraq and Afghanistan presented an inevitable contrast to their own regimes. And, for that matter, for would-be Islamist revolutionaries, Iraq not only provided a place to prove themselves in battle, but also showed them how to run an insurgency in their own backyards. If U.S. intervention in the region wounded the pride of Arabs and Muslims, it also awakened them to the fact that maybe they could do it themselves – which was the idea of the neocon theory all along, that the process, once started, could develop a momentum of its own without requiring ceaseless American war. We would go to war in Iraq so we wouldn’t have to go to war everywhere else. The Bush Administration’s aggressive pressure also contributed to the dictators’ walkbacks – Qaddafi abandoning his WMD program, Assad leaving Lebanon. Where Saddam had shown a face of defiance, the Arab peoples now saw that even a bloodied, quagmired U.S. could bring the region’s strongmen to heel.

Iraq alone wasn’t the sole cause of the turning; al Jazeera, which had arrived in 1996 and really took off after 9/11, itself had a role in changing the way the region’s people saw their societies. As Rany Jazayerli put it:

Al Jazeera was, from its first day on the air, something the Arab world had never seen before: a television channel in Arabic, available to almost everyone in the Arab world, that provided a frank and reasonably unbiased source of news. It provided the unvarnished truth, and that made it extremely dangerous. If there was corruption going on in Jordan, it was reported. If there was a government crackdown in Egypt, it was reported. If a Saudi dissident living in exile in England had some scandalous information about the Saudi royal family, it was reported. All you need to know about Al Jazeera is that its greatest critics are the Arab governments, who have applied all kinds of pressure on Qatar – where Al Jazeera is based – to tone down the rhetoric… For the last 15 years, then, the Arab world has had the access that was denied them for so long. They’ve seen the truth about how oppressive and hypocritical their own governments are, and they’ve seen the truth about how messy and imperfect and yet ultimately how ennobling and empowering Western democracies are…And having already opened the barn door to letting the masses own satellite dishes, the governments of the region were mostly helpless to do anything about it.

Satellite TV would not be the only technological advance to grease the skids; the internet and social networks like Facebook and Twitter were also altering the playing field. But tools of communications can be a two-way street for propaganda and surveillance, as well; what makes them work is when they have something to talk about.

Flypaper

While the tide of Arab and Muslim revolution was surging in the Greater Middle East, it was waning in the West. Directly provoking the “Arab street” raised concerns about retaliation by the extremists, but the opposite has been true since the region really began boiling in 2005. We’ve seen three really large-scale terror attacks – the kind that require coordination and planning – far from the Greater Middle East since 9/11: the October 2002 Bali bombing, the March 2004 train bombings in Madrid, and the July 2005 bus and train bombings in London. India, still locked in a front-line struggle with Pakistani extremists, has not been so fortunate, being hit by terror attacks in Mumbai in November 2008 (the work of Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistani Muslim terror group) and again in July 2011. The same is true of Chechen terror attacks in Moscow in 2002 and 2010. (And, of course, Islamists within Europe have been busy with their own forms of homegrown mischief.) The decline in large-scale terror operations is partly due to good fortune, good law enforcement and domestic surveillance; certainly there have been a number of attempted terror attacks against the U.S. that got pretty far, such as the December 2001 “shoe bomber,” the December 2009 “underwear bomber” and a May 2010 truck bomb in Times Square. And smaller independent attacks, some of them with major death tolls, have continued: the July 2002 LAX shooter, the Fall 2002 Beltway snipers, the November 2009 Fort Hood shooter, the April 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing. But any accounting of major terrorist attacks since the invasion of Iraq shows a distinct shift towards attacks within the region itself.

This, too, was – as Marshall acknowledged at the time – an inherent, if usually unstated, assumption of the neocon grand strategy. People who are busy killing each other won’t have time to kill anyone else. A region that is pulling itself apart will not be able to project force outward. A region engaged in a mad scramble for power internally will dedicate its arms, its money and its excitable underemployed young men to winning that struggle rather than staging complex covert operations in another hemisphere.

Sowing dissension among one’s enemies has a long history; perhaps the most successful example was Imperial Germany’s success in taking Russia out of World War I by shipping Lenin into Russia in the spring of 1917. In this case, it’s a logical extension of the “flypaper theory” of the Iraq War. The idea that the region’s Islamic extremists should be enticed into Iraq to fight U.S. troops was sometimes referred to as a “flypaper” strategy – that they’d be drawn in and trapped where we wanted them, and thus that a bloody insurgency was actually good news. Flypaper may sound like a callous attitude towards the safety of American troops, but the thinking is actually the ancient motivation of men at war: confront and kill the enemy on the battlefield so he cannot disturb your homeland. It is perhaps a more cynical approach to the security of the local population – but then, it’s not unreasonable to want the problems of Iraq and other nations in the region to be played out on their soil rather than ours.

That was never the original war plan, of course; the insurgency may not have been adequately planned for by the Bush team, but it did not result from any provocation by the United States – it was wholly the independent decision of those who rejected a democratic political process in which the Iraqi people would be sovereign. Nevertheless, it was implicit in the broader idea of creating a contest for supremacy in the heart of the region.

And in that regard, even though American troops have left Iraq and are nearing their departure from Afghanistan, the flypaper theory writ large is alive and well. Civil war in Syria, Libya and Afghanistan, coup in Egypt, revolution in Tunisia…these are all conflicts that entice the jihadists to test their mettle and influence closer to home rather than travel to the West, and give them enemies other than the U.S., Europe and Israel against whom to vent their frustrations. In that regard, the current landscape may represent the fruits of the neocon project, but it’s also in line with old-fashioned cynical realpolitik (division to my enemies!) as well as embodying the kind of Jacksonian attitude towards one’s enemies that Harry Truman voiced in 1941 when he expressed the view that “If we see that Germany is winning we ought to help Russia and if Russia is winning we ought to help Germany, and that way let them kill as many as possible, although I don’t want to see Hitler victorious under any circumstances.”

All of these attitudes are wholly foreign to President Obama and his national security team, but they have been neither willing nor able to put the genie back in the bottle, as the momentum and internal logic of the whirlwind have swept away one effort after another to re-impose order.

Where We Go From Here

The grand strategy of the neocons has long since passed out of their control, as few still have any influence with the Obama Administration or even in Congress. But the regional revolution they set ablaze is still with us, and they must trust that the path will be clear enough that even those skeptical of the project will make the proper choices. That is a dicey proposition, because few on either side of the political spectrum understand or accept the grand strategic proposition of turning the region’s angst inward to the battle for its own future.

On the Left, there remains no coherent grand strategy or even petit strategy.

On the Left, there remains no coherent grand strategy or even petit strategy. None of what is laid out above should excuse the Obama Administration from the choices it has made, its inability at times to face the new realities of the region for the challenges and opportunities they present, or its general preference (abroad as at home) for negotiating with elites rather than accepting the messy dynamism of popular sovereignty. In 2009, Obama spoke in Mubarak’s Egypt as if the region had been oppressed by President Bush rather than by its tyrants. Since then, as he has grudgingly let go of that illusion, he failed when he had the chance to encourage moderate forces to rebel against the old order in Iran and Syria, was flat-footed in Egypt and constantly behind the curve in Libya. He has seemed, at times, more interested in weapons than people, and completely oblivious to the efforts of Iran and its ally Russia to gain regional hegemony. He has managed neither a strong hand controlling events nor to wash his hands of responsibility for them. He has acted less like the world’s policeman than the world’s meter maid, handing out tickets to scofflaws.

On the Right, Jacksonian critics of the neocon project have tended to focus on Islam as an insoluble obstacle to reforming the region, a critique that I’ve written about before as presenting a collision between two longstanding conservative paradigms: the view of human nature as universal and the view of culture as overriding in its importance. But the facts on the ground have mooted that objection, as nobody has a practical solution if the problem is something inherent in the faith of a billion Muslims; we have no choice but to appeal over the heads of culture to the basic human desire for a better life on this earth. Despairing of a solution is no solution at all.

The way forward must focus on seeking to encourage and influence popular movements to proceed in a democratic, pro-freedom, pro-American direction rather than trying to put the Humpty Dumpty of strongmen – nominally respectful of Westphalian borders and disciplined by international sanctions regimes – back together again. The revolution has come; we should do what we can to see to it that the Islamists are not left alone to ride the wave, as they did in Iran in 1979, Afghanistan in 1996 and Egypt in 2011. And there is a role again for realpolitik as well; we should see the proxy battles between Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey as an opportunity to play balance-of-power politics in the region and prevent one side from gaining the upper hand.

After the fire of September 11, the neocon plan for the Greater Middle East brought not peace, but a sword. America doesn’t need to wield that sword in every conflict – this is a fight that affects us and one we can influence, but in the end it is not our fight to win because it is not our people who must make the final choice. But our ability to affect the course of events begins by recognizing that it’s still the neocons’ world, there is no way out of the fire but forward.

Can We Finally Start Talking About The Global Persecution Of Christians?,"Wealthy Kenyans and Westerners bustled about Westgate Shopping Mall in Nairobi on Saturday. Families ate lunch in the food court. A radio station targeting Kenyan Asians was hosting a children’s event on the roof of the parking lot.

Around noon, armed gunmen stormed the mall and exploded grenades. Thousands of terrified people dropped to the floor, fled out of exits and hid in stores. The gunmen began lining people up and shooting some of the five dozen people they would slaughter and 240 people, ages 2 to 78, that they would wound.

Al-Shabaab, which is claiming credit for the attack, is reported to have singled out non-Muslims. “A witness to the attacks at Nairobi’s upscale mall says that gunmen told Muslims to stand up and leave and that non-Muslims would be targeted,” according to the Associated Press.

To weed out the infidels, according to news reports, the terrorists asked people for the name of Muhammad’s mother or to recite a verse from the Quran.

And that wasn’t even the worst terrorist attack of the weekend.

The Washington Post reported that one British mother and her young children survived when captors who shot her allowed her to leave on the condition she immediately convert to Islam. The siege of the mall, which included the taking of hostages, lasted four days. Three floors of the mall collapsed and bodies were buried in the rubble.

And that wasn’t even the worst terrorist attack of the weekend.

The next day, two suicide bombs went off as Christians were leaving Sunday services at All Saints Anglican Church in Peshawar, Pakistan.

“There were blasts and there was hell for all of us,” Nazir John, who was at the church with at least 400 other worshipers, told the Associated Press. “When I got my senses back, I found nothing but smoke, dust, blood and screaming people. I saw severed body parts and blood all around.”

Some 85 Christians were slaughtered and 120 injured, the bloodiest attack on Christians in Pakistan in history. The hospital ran out of beds for the injured and there weren’t enough caskets for the dead.

“I found nothing but smoke, dust, blood and screaming people. I saw severed body parts and blood all around.”

The situation for Christians in Egypt has also gone from bad to worse. August saw the worst anti-Christian violence in seven centuries. Sam Tadros, a Coptic Christian and author of Motherland Lost, says that there has been nothing like this year’s Muslim Brotherhood anti-Christian pogrom since 1321, when a similar wave of church burnings and persecution caused the decline of the Christian community in Egypt from nearly half of Egypt’s population to its current ten percent.

The violence of just three days in mid-August was staggering. Thirty-eight churches were destroyed, 23 vandalized; 58 homes were burned and looted and 85 shops, 16 pharmacies and 3 hotels were demolished. It was so bad that the Coptic Pope was in hiding, many Sunday services were canceled, and Christians stayed indoors, fearing for their lives. Six Christians were killed in the violence. Seven were kidnapped.

Maalula, Syria, is an ancient Christian town that has been so sheltered for 2,000 years that it’s one of only three villages where people still speak Aramaic, the language of Jesus. Until September 7, when Islamist rebels attacked as part of the civil war ripping through the country.

An eyewitness to the murder of three Christians in Maalula—Mikhael Taalab, his cousin Antoun Taalab, and his grandson Sarkis el Zakhm—reported that the Islamists warned everyone present to convert to Islam. Sarkis answered clearly, Vatican news agency Fides reported: “I am a Christian and if you want to kill me because I am a Christian, do it.”

Sister Carmel, one of the Christians in Damascus who assist Maalula’s many displaced Christians, told Fides, “What Sarkis did is true martyrdom, a death in odium fidei.”

In recent weeks, we have Muslims killing Christians in Kenya, Egypt, Pakistan and Syria. Again.

It’s time to ask an important question that many of us have successfully avoided for far too long:

Can we finally start talking about the global persecution of Christians and other non-Muslims?

Finally? Please?

A case study in reaction

As Paul Marshall, Lela Gilbert and Nina Shea write in Persecuted: The Global Assault on Christians, “Christians are the single most widely persecuted religious group in the world today. This is confirmed in studies by sources as diverse as the Vatican, Open Doors, the Pew Research Center, Commentary, Newsweek and the Economist. According to one estimate, by the Catholic Bishops’ Conferences of the European Community, 75 percent of acts of religious intolerance are directed against Christians.”

How well does the media tell that story? And how did they cover this weekend’s events? As Anglicans and other Christians worldwide grieved the brutal attack in Pakistan, the media… did not. The worst attack on Pakistani Christians in history didn’t make the front page of the New York Times. The Washington Post buried the story on page A7 of Monday’s paper. On the front page of the BBC web site, a small headline “Pakistan church blast kills dozens” was below stories on Angela Merkel and the Emmys. By the next day, the story was nowhere to be found.

British blogger Archbishop Cranmer noted, “Without media coverage we in the West cannot smell the fear of those Christians who are persecuted by Muslims all over the world.”

“Without media coverage we in the West cannot smell the fear of those Christians who are persecuted by Muslims all over the world.”

Even when the media do cover violence against Christians, the religion angle tends to be buried or given short shrift. Part of this is because politicians, who are the primary sources for many of these news stories, don’t have a strong incentive to confront the reality of Muslim violence against non-Muslims (or, to be honest, many other complicated problems). Imran Khan, whose party leads the government in Peshawar, suggested that the church bombing attack wasn’t about religion but, rather, an effort to scuttle peace talks. He also blamed U.S. drone strikes for provoking militants. That’s all all well and good, but violence against Christians goes back even before 2001, when Predator drones armed with Hellfire missiles began to be used in Pakistan to assassinate terrorist leaders and their companions. By about 1300 years.

The Christian Science Monitor asked the promising question, “Why did militants attack Pakistani Christians?” and discovered that, well, it was really just a case of militants of unspecified religion looking for a “controversial” target and “more spectacular, attention-grabbing attacks.” Why the church? Certainly not because of any particular animosity towards Christians—it was just that the Christians were “vulnerable.”

Trying to explain the attack in Kenya, Think Progress published an interesting piece headlined “What The Deadly Attack On A Kenya Mall Was Really About.” It talks about the weakness of al Shabaab and the terror group’s efforts to provoke conflict in Kenya. The words Muslim and Islam do not appear in the article. Another article is headlined “Five Things The Kenya Mall Attack Tells Us About Global Terrorism.” Spoiler alert: The Kenya mall attack doesn’t tell us anything about religious violence.

And what about Egypt? Well, as the persecution of Christians has heated up, the press tends to portray the violence against Christians as “sectarian skirmishes” or “clashes” between religious groups. This is about as accurate as describing the Armenian genocide as “clashes” between Turks and Armenians.

“Islam is peace.”

Right after the worst terrorist attack on American soil on September 11, 2001, American leaders from George W. Bush on down rushed to portray Islam as peaceful. While it’s simplistic to characterize any religion or other belief system as being strictly about “violence” or “peace,” the Bush Administration had a compelling political interest in marginalizing Islamist terrorists and assuring Muslims throughout the world that American reprisals weren’t going to be indiscriminately applied to all practitioners of the religion.

Sure, the terrorists clearly and explicitly claimed they were fighting for Islam. But if Americans responded in agreement, the duty of Muslims to fight for their religion could have quickly led to a global conflagration.

Politicians claiming Islam is nothing more than a peaceful religion usually aren’t exegetical experts.

On September 17, 2001, President George W. Bush stopped by the Islamic Center of Washington, D.C., and said, “The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam. That’s not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace. These terrorists don’t represent peace. They represent evil and war.”

Twelve years ago in the heat of the moment, this may have made sense, however ill-advised it is for politicians to be taken seriously as theologians (even those who claim Jesus as their favorite political philosopher). But politicians are still doing it. After two Islamist terrorists beheaded a British soldier in the street in front of an elementary school, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg quoted from the Quran and assured everyone that Islam had been “perverted” by soldier Lee Rigby’s murderers, who claimed they were beheading the soldier in the name of Islam.

“Terrorism has no religion because there is no religious conviction that can justify the kind of arbitrary, savage random violence that we saw on the streets of Woolwich,” said Clegg.

That’s very similar to what Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said in his statement this weekend: “The terrorists have no religion and targeting innocent people is against the teachings of Islam and all religions.”

Well it’s all settled then! If we could just somehow convey to the Islamist terrorists that they, in fact, have no relationship whatsoever to Islam, we could all just get back to the business of watching Emmys.

One problem with this approach, and I’m not even talking about the 1300 years of history that speaks to the use of violence in pursuit of the spread of Islam, is that the politicians claiming Islam is nothing more than a peaceful religion usually aren’t exegetical experts.

For example, Clegg cited chapter 5, verse 32 of the Quran as “If anyone kills a human being it shall be as though he killed all mankind whereas if anyone saves a life it shall be as though he saved the whole of mankind.”

This is a favorite verse of politicians. (It’s also been used by Bush’s successor, President Barack Obama.) The only problem with using this verse is that people always fail to quote the entire verse, which in this case changes the meaning a bit. And even worse, the verse is excerpted completely out of context. With the caveat that any time you put 12 Muslims, Mormons or Methodists in a room, you might get 12 different explanations for what a verse means, let’s just say that even a reading of the following verse suggests that we’re not exactly in the peaceful section of the Quran:

Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land. That is for them a disgrace in this world; and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment.

One could understand that some Muslims might interpret this in a manner differently than Deputy Prime Minister Clegg. To constantly harp on the fact that most Muslims are not violent obscures the reality that, well, a good number are.

Is 47 million al Qaeda sympathizers a low number, really?

It’s like those Pew polls that come out every two years showing that most Muslims do not, in fact, support al Qaeda. Last year’s release began:

A year after the death of its leader, al Qaeda is widely unpopular among Muslim publics. A new poll by the Pew Research Center’s Global Attitudes Project, conducted March 19 to April 13, 2012, finds majorities – and mostly large majorities – expressing negative views of the terrorist group in Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan, Turkey and Lebanon.

The media went along with the press release. The Los Angeles Times headline was “Muslims in Middle East, Asia think poorly of Al Qaeda, poll finds.” U.S. News & World Report went with “After bin Laden’s Death, al Qaeda’s Popularity Wanes.” CNN’s story was “Poll: Many Muslims in Mideast, Pakistan have poor view of al Qaeda,” which included this paragraph:

In Pakistan, where U.S. Navy SEALs killed the al Qaeda leader during a raid on a compound a year ago, 55% of the Muslims surveyed had a negative opinion of the terrorist group, according to the poll. Only 13% had a favorable view.

It’s wonderful and important news that the percentage of Muslims in five countries who don’t like al Qaeda is as low as it is. But I think we forgot to notice that it’s still alarmingly high!

Yes, “only” 21 percent of Egyptian Muslims, 15 percent of Jordanian Muslims, 13 percent of Pakistani Muslims, 6 percent of Turkish Muslims and 2 percent of Lebanese Muslims express favorable views toward one particular terrorist group.

But when you think about how those percentages represent 47,284,049 Muslims in only five of the 50 countries in which a majority of the population is Muslim, it becomes a bit more alarming. The poll doesn’t mention support for al Qaeda-linked terrorists in, for example, Indonesia, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia.

Saturday people, Sunday people

We’re talking about Christian persecution by Muslims because of a particularly macabre issue: Jews have already largely been driven out of many Muslim countries.

Lela Gilbert, a journalist who writes about Jewish and Christian persecution, tells of encountering jihadi graffiti in Jerusalem that read “First comes Saturday, then comes Sunday.” She didn’t get the meaning at first. A friend explained that it referred to Jews worshiping on Saturday and Christians on Sunday and, more subtly, about the order that non-Muslims would be targeted.

Gilbert notes that in 1948 there were about 135,000 Jews in Iraq. Now there are fewer than a dozen. In 2003, Iraq had a fairly strong Christian population. Since 2003, more than half of the 800,000 Christians have fled church bombings, rapes, torture, kidnapping, beheading and house eviction.

Or take Egypt. In 1947 there were about 100,000 Jews there. Today there are less than 50, Gilbert says. And Egypt’s Copts — numbering about 8 million — are experiencing the worst anti-Christian pogrom in 700 years. The 30,000 Jews in 1948 Syria are down to less than a dozen. It’s the Christians’ turn.

Preparation before the conversation

Before we can have an actual conversation about the persecution of Christians and others at the hands of Muslims, we have to lay some groundwork. Here are some quick thoughts for journalists, politicians and the Christian Church.

Journalists: Many journalists act as if they can’t report that acts of violence appear to have some kind of Muslim faith behind them because it might inflame anti-Muslim feelings. This reportorial approach is paired with an odd desire to hype any act of “violence” by Christians. This is why the American media will highlight a tiny Florida church burning some Quran while not mentioning that, say, the entire Kingdom of Saudia Arabia confiscates all Bibles at customs and destroys them.

When and where violence occurs involving Muslims and Christians, as it did in Pakistan, Kenya, Syria and Egypt, it is framed as a political conflict, with no examination of the religious details. Not only is this grievously unfair to the Christians who continue to be slaughtered while the rest of the world is busy watching Dancing With The Stars, it’s also a disservice to Islam, whose followers are not monolithic in their persecution of non-Muslims. Many Muslims themselves are persecuted in the name of Muslim violence. To take the most recent example, at least 96 people in Iraq were killed this past weekend when a string of bombs detonated in short order, targeting Shiite funeral-goers. Muslims who defend Christians are a bold lot. Salman Taseer, the Punjab governor, was a vocal opponent of anti-blasphemy laws that target Christians and other religious minorities. For this, he was assassinated in 2011 by his security guard.

It’s not journalists’ job to protect the public from these facts. And if it were, it would be impossible. While the media may think they’ve done a good job of obscuring part of this reality, most people have figured out that a lot of Muslims do support violence as a part of the way of Islam. And they’ve figured out as well that a lot of Muslims don’t. Both groups can appeal to long traditions within Islam for their defense.

It is the job of journalists to convey information about local and world events in all their complexity and nuance. While most media outlets privilege politics over other cultural factors, journalists really need to be cognizant about how ignorance of the role of religion harms news gathering. They should make sure their sources aren’t just politicians. They should make sure their understanding of religion is respectful of the importance it plays in most people’s lives.

Politicians: Politicians need to stop giving speeches that claim to know the heart of Muslims or the true meaning of Islam. It’s offensive and it’s not helping. And if politicians are going to give scolding speeches about religious beliefs, here’s a thought: Less of condemnation of “those who slander the prophet of Islam” and more condemnation of “those who slaughter Pakistani Christians coming out of worship.” Without even getting into whether there is a foreign policy role to play in the persecution of Christians, the American bully pulpit and diplomacy corps could stand to speak more clearly about religious violence. The current model of apologizing for American freedoms is indefensible.

The Christian Church: Whether journalists stop downplaying the facts of the persecution of Christians, Christians need to stay informed. Even if American politicians respond to Islamist violence by apologizing for the freedom of speech and of religion, the church must remain vigilant. And many are. The media didn’t quite pick up on the significance of the event, but Pope Benedict XVI announced the canonization of the Martyrs of Otranto in the same consistory in which he announced his intention to resign the papacy. In May, Pope Francis canonized the 800 Christians, who were beheaded for their faith after Turkish Muslims invaded their city in 1480. In his words, “They had refused to renounce their faith and died confessing the risen Christ.” Most church bodies have prayer guides to help members pray for the persecuted church. And many religious human rights groups work hard to get word out about persecution worldwide. Christians and others interested in stopping religious persecution should ask media outlets to cover news such as the forced conversions, blasphemy persecutions and bombings of Christians.

However much we may wish Muslim violence against Christians would resolve itself or go away, being in denial serves no purpose. To combat the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities, we must first acknowledge its existence. And we need to be clear about exactly who is perpetrating violence against Christians and what is motivating them.

Sole Survivor Of Harrowing Religious Cleansing Operation Has A Message,"Late in the evening of November 28 last year, Habila Adamu was at home with his wife and kids in the Yobe state of Northern Nigeria when visitors stopped by. He opened the door, shocked to find gunmen wearing robes and masks.

They demanded he step outside and they peppered him with questions. What was his name? Habila Adamu. Was he a member of the Nigerian police? No. Was he a soldier? No. Was he a member of the state security service? No. He told them he was a businessman.

“OK, are you a Christian?” they asked.

“I am a Christian,” Habila said.

Initially fearful, Habila came to terms with the realization that it was the day of his death. He began praying for strength, forgiveness and salvation.

The gunmen wanted to know why he was not Muslim and told him they’d spare his life if he renounced his faith. His wife begged him to do what he needed to do to live. But he told them he was ready to die as a Christian. Before he could even get the statement out a second time, they shot him in the face.

Everyone thought he was dead. The gunmen began shouting Allah Akbar. His wife began sobbing. Even Habila was waiting for an angel to come and take him to heaven. Somehow he survived — the sole survivor of a Boko Haram attack on all the Christian men in his village.

Habila shares his story — as he did before a Congressional subcommittee on Tuesday and at the Hudson Institute in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday — so that he can tell people that “To live in this world is to live for Christ, to die is gain.” That and, “Do everything that you can to end this ruthless religious persecution in Northern Nigeria.”

It’s the latter message that political Washington is paying attention to this week.

Washington’s New Posture Toward Boko Haram

Boko Haram is the colloquial name of “The Congregation of the People of Tradition for Proselytism and Jihad.” Boko Haram means something like Western education is sinful. The group seeks to establish a pure Islamic state ruled by sharia and to end Western influences. Launched shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the group has ramped up its terror attacks since 2009. Adherents are known for attacking Christians and their churches as well as government targets.

Habila and various other Nigerians and human rights observers were testifying before Congress as part of a years-long attempt to get Boko Haram designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Rep. Chris Smith, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights and International Organizations, was pushing H.R. 3209, the Boko Haram Terrorist Designation Act of 2013.

On the day of the hearing, the State Department so designated Boko Haram and splinter group Ansaru.

It’s about time. President Obama has called the group “one of the most vicious terrorist organizations in the world.” And The State Department last year ranked it as the 2nd deadliest terrorist group worldwide after the Taliban. As CNN reported:

Afghanistan’s Taliban was by far the deadliest group in 2012, when it launched 525 attacks that killed 1,842 people.



The second deadliest group was Nigeria’s Boko Haram, a jihadist group that orchestrated 364 attacks last year that killed 1,132 people.

As Jacob Zenn of the Jamestown Foundation put it in his congressional testimony this week, “If Boko Haram is not [a foreign terrorist organization], then who is?”

Boko Haram has modeled itself after the Taliban. Two years ago it gave Christians three days to leave Northern Nigeria or be killed. Since then, there’s been a systematic campaign of religious cleansing.

In late September, Boko Haram opened fire on sleeping college students in Nigeria, killing 40 of them. Attacks on schools are so prevalent that Education Testing Services just this week indefinitely suspended both the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) in Nigeria “due to security concerns.”

Last year 47 churches were attacked. This year 53 churches have been attacked and 216 people murdered in them.

“September marked the highest death toll since 2009 with deaths in the region of 500 including a rush-hour ambush in which chainsaws were used to decapitate travelers, a school massacre, a military ambush and scorched earth raids on villages in Gwoza,” said human rights activist Emmanuel Ogebe in his testimony.

That month also saw a massacre of some 152 drivers and passengers who were taken out of their cars and had their identification cards checked before being slaughtered. And just this week 26 people were killed in raids on villages and 40 houses were torched in Boko Haram raids.

On Wednesday, the same day the U.S. designated both groups as terrorist, Boko Haram and Ansaru reportedly worked together to kidnap a French priest in Cameroon.

Downplaying religion

Boko Haram characterizes itself as a religious organization motivated by religious beliefs. Adamu Habila’s testimony of his interaction with Boko Haram shows the importance of religion. So do the bombings, beheadings and shootings of Christians, their churches, and other Nigerians who tolerate them.

But the State Department sees things somewhat differently. The Obama Administration isn’t as interested in looking at the religious motivation of Boko Haram as it is interested in getting Nigeria to think of all the other issues that might play a role in the conflict. Or as the Associated Press put it:

The Obama administration has urged Nigeria to develop a comprehensive approach to address the threat by creating a more professional security force, meeting the economic needs of the people in northern Nigeria, adhering to rule of law and government accountability.

Wednesday’s testimony from Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, barely mentioned religion. That she did at all was considered something of a small victory by interested observers. She said that Boko Haram and Ansaru attack “numerous Christians and an even greater number of Muslims,” though she didn’t indicate where she got her numbers. Then she talked about “regional and socioeconomic disparities,” and unemployment:

Boko Haram’s activities call our attention not just to violence, but also to poverty and inequality in Nigeria…



Good governance, healthy political competition, and equitable economic growth would go a long way to address all of these challenges. The strategy for countering Boko Haram should be, in other words, holistic.

This type of rhetoric is typical of the State Department. The previous Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Johnnie Carson, gave a speech the day after an Easter service bombing of a church in Nigeria that left 39 dead last year. He said:

I want to take this opportunity to stress one key point and that is that religion is not driving extremist violence either in Jos or northern Nigeria.

A U.S. foreign policy that encourages interpretation of religious violence as merely the failure of governments to provide services creates false incentives, said Ann Buwalda, executive director of Jubilee Campaign, which focuses on international religious freedom. If poverty or weak government services is the problem, the solutions tend to involve providing aid to the dangerous parties and areas, a subsidization that can reward and strengthen hostile forces more than combat them.

And oversight is key for managing the disbursement of large sums of cash and resources. For instance, USAID gives millions of dollars to Nigeria to support education:

The programs target public, Qur’anic and Islamiyya schools. Qur’anic schools focus on learning the Qur’an and Islamic values while Islamiyya schools integrate classes to build skills in reading local language and numeracy into the traditional Qur’anic curriculum.

Funding madrasas is a stated priority of U.S. aid, but critics suggest that the federal government has no idea what is being taught in Islamiyya schools. The curriculum subsidized by U.S. tax dollars could very well be funding inculcation of values at odds with U.S. foreign policy goals.

For it’s part, Boko Haram has attempted to reassure the State Department that religion does, in fact, drive its extremist violence. Just last week it released a video taking responsibility for the October 24 attack in the northern city of Damaturu that led to the deaths of 35 people. Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau didn’t mention unemployment or poorly administered government services, but he did say:

This is a brief message to the world. We carried out the Damaturu attacks with Allah’s help, with Allah’s might, with Allah’s glory and with victory from Allah, the Creator.

There’s no doubt that the religious cleansing in northern Nigeria is a complex problem requiring a multi-faceted response. The testimonies of Habila and Abubakar Shekau speak clearly to the role religion plays in this conflict. Lest it waste taxpayer dollars or perpetuate the very problem it seeks to solve, U.S. foreign policy should not downplay the role that religion plays in the persecution of Christians and others in Northern Nigeria.

For his part, Adamu says he believed he survived so he could get the message out about what’s happening in Northern Nigeria. He asks that the 900 Christians killed this year alone by Boko Haram will not be forgotten.",https://thefederalist.com/2013/11/16/survivor-religious-cleansing/,2013-11-16
Planned Parenthood’s Abortion Theater,"Marni Evans, 37, is a striking woman with dark and well-coiffed hair. Her ensemble suggests a comfortable living. She sits down for a videotaped interview, holding the hand of John Lockhart, her fiancé. John, 43, is bald and wears glasses. His fashionable western shirt is rolled up to his elbows. He’s a software engineer. Trained as an architect, she’s a self-employed sustainability consultant.

They tell the story about how they discovered they were expecting. “I was late by a couple of days and so I had this suspicion that we were pregnant and then we went and got a home pregnancy test and verified that. And of course we were still in such shock that we went to Planned Parenthood and had an official pregnancy test done just to verify it. And found out — yes, yes, yes, it’s positive.”

They decided to end the life of the baby growing inside her. Or as we euphemistically like to put it, they decided to have an abortion.

We know all this because the Texas Tribune produced a glowing 6:34 video of the couple talking about how awful a new Texas law is that improves standards of care for women seeking abortions. Advocates of abortion say these improved standards — such as requiring that doctors who perform abortions have hospital admitting privileges within 30 miles of the clinic — are unnecessary and infringe upon the right to end the lives of unborn children via abortion. That portion of the law went into effect on November 1.

Her abortion clinic canceled the appointment because her doctor didn’t have admitting privileges at any of Austin’s hospitals.

The Tribune video and accompanying story are a fascinating look at media coverage of abortion. As has become standard in such situations, no difficult questions are posed to the couple. Even though other abortionists in Austin meet the standards of Texas’ new law, for instance, her curious claim that she had to use frequent flyer miles to book a flight to Seattle, of all places, to abort the baby receives no apparent push back. (Later we’re told she did just book with a different doctor in the same town in which she lives — no flight necessary.)

Marni says she and her fiancé looked at the pros and cons of allowing the unborn child to continue living or aborting it. They looked at “the health of our relationship” (presumably good enough to be engaged and knocking boots without effective birth control other than abortion), “how long we’ve been together” (presumably long enough to be betrothed to each other), and “do we have enough built as a foundation to create a loving happy healthy family” (John is sitting right there when she lets this line just hang there, uncomfortably).

Marni says they considered their self-employment and variable paychecks. For what it’s worth, even if they both only made the median income for males and females in Austin, which is doubtful considering their careers, that would put them in the wealthiest 3 percent of the global population, with an income 20 times the typical person.

At the end of this magnificent and compelling case for the violent act of abortion, John says, “For all the reasons Marni described, this was absolutely not the right time for us to have a child.”

Did I mention she’s 37 and he’s 43? Is this really the best case abortion proponents could put forward to tug at the heart-strings of abortion moderates? A financially well-off, educated, older couple who might be witnessing their last chance at conceiving a child?

Or as I put it on Twitter:

I think @TexasTribune tried to make a big pro-choice video but accidentally made a big pro-life video. http://t.co/cXQ8UZbhKk

Abortion and Public Relations

What’s really interesting about this story is how it came to be told. The Tribune’s video of the calm and composed couple was posted on November 3. Here’s what Marni was doing on the day of her canceled abortion. She sent this note to Rick Jervis, USA Today’s Austin correspondent:

@MrRJervis my Austin abortion was cancelled today; flying to Seattle. Want to hear my story?



— Marni Jade Evans (@marnijade) November 1, 2013



It’s what we’d all do on the day of our abortion being canceled, right? And we wouldn’t just write Jervis. Here’s her note to Abby Ohlheiser, staff writer at The Atlantic Wire:

@abbyohlheiser my Texas abortion was cancelled today and I am flying to Washington state. hear my story @marnijade



— Marni Jade Evans (@marnijade) November 1, 2013

That was followed up by this note to Washington Post’s Chris Cillizza, naturally:

@TheFix My Austin abortion scheduled for today was cancelled and I’m flying to Seattle. Hear my story. @marnijade



— Marni Jade Evans (@marnijade) November 1, 2013

We all tweet to the Washington Post’s Chris Cillizza about our abortions, right? There are no tweets from Evans to the Texas Tribune, but somehow the savvy public relations campaign was brought to their attention. And a few other folks.

Now, maybe Marni Evans just happened to deal with her abortion situation via a savvy public relations campaign. And maybe Marni Evans just happened to echo the sentiments and rhetoric of a big new abortion rights campaign built around efforts to destigmatize the legal practice of killing the babies growing within our wombs. That campaign, which was written about here, has enjoyed major success in the media. Here’s New York Mag’s participation in it:

It should be noted that the stories — about repeat abortions, callous attitudes and bullying boyfriends — may have done just as much to reinforce the stigma as anything else.

But while there’s always been a separation between abortion rights mythmaking and reality, we’ve hit a moment unrivaled since the storytelling surrounding “Jane Roe” of Roe V. Wade.

Komen vs. Planned Parenthood

As detailed by former Susan G. Komen honcho Karen Handel in her expose “Planned Bullyhood,” the cancer-fighting charity’s funding decisions were sabotaged by the theatrical breaking of a “gentle-ladies agreement” Komen had with Planned Parenthood. Komen had been funding Planned Parenthood for years even though the abortion giant didn’t do any actual mammograms. The grants were “pass-through” grants, meaning that Planned Parenthood was basically the middle man between women and groups that offered mammograms. Komen, under heat from pro-lifers who wanted to fund the charity but not Planned Parenthood, made an agreement to quietly stop giving these grants. The two groups even worked on shared public relations statements.

But someone leaked the news to the Associated Press at precisely the same time that Planned Parenthood was ready with a new campaign fighting the Komen Foundation’s change of direction. High-ranking elected officials, media figures and celebrities were lined up ready to support Planned Parenthood in one of the most stunning attacks on a charity in memory. The once-popular Komen couldn’t take the heat and backed down within three days. One of the interesting things revealed by Handel is that the public relations professionals hired by Komen to help with the transition away from funding Planned Parenthood were Hilary Rosen, a communications and media consultant at SKDKnickerbocker, and Brenday Daly, a PR consultant who had worked with Planned Parenthood’s Cecile Richards at Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s office. SKDKnickerbocker also employs former Obama White House Communications Director Anita Dunn, and represented none other than Sandra Fluke a few months after the Komen debacle kicked off the “War on Women.”

A Not-So-Spontaneous Social Media Outpouring

More recently, the media reported on what seemed like an organic outpouring of social media support for Texas Sen. Wendy Davis’s filibuster of the Texas bill protecting unborn children who had made it through five months’ gestation. She was feted on every Sunday morning talk show, magazine covers and most print outlets. What was almost not covered at all was the savvy public relations campaign that prepared the way for the filibuster, which you can read about in the Washington Post’s blog post headlined “Wendy Davis ‘tweetstorm’ was planned in advance“:

That “tweetstorming” tactic was essentially what pushed Davis, by degrees, into the national spotlight. After five hours, the #standwithwendy hashtag was picked up by the national ACLU and Planned Parenthood, which have a combined 259,000 followers. Less than an hour later, at 5:53 CT, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted her own message of support — followed one hour later by a tweet from President Obama that was reshared nearly 17,000 times.

Celebrities who providentially happened to help out at just the right time included the comedian Rob Delaney, with more than 870,000 followers, Mark Ruffalo, Lena Dunham and Sarah Silverman. Serendipitous, really.

Abortion Kickstarters

Let’s look at a few other stories coming from pro-choice activists. Jodi Jacobson is the editor-in-chief of RH RealityCheck, an abortion news site. An enthusiastic, if misguided, tweeter, she recently announced a kickstarter-style campaign for an abortion. She linked to the fundraiser, headlined “Help Save Florence’s Life,” which says:

Florence is a young immigrant from Africa with very few contacts in the United States. She wanted to have her baby, but she has a life-threatening genetic disease which has complicated her pregnancy and made her very, very sick. She’s more than 20 weeks pregnant – she tried to raise the money for her procedure earlier but she just couldn’t make it. Now, because of clinic closures and the new ban on procedures after 20 weeks, Florence is unable to access an abortion in Texas.

Knowledgeable readers will immediately identify problems. Foremost, while Texas law does protect children who have made it through five months’ gestation, there is an exemption for mothers who face life-threatening pregnancies.

Assuming Florence is real and really does face a life-threatening pregnancy, Texas law permits her to procure an abortion. And better yet, if the baby has gestated in her mother’s womb for 23 weeks or so, that baby may be viable and able to be delivered, thereby preserving the life of the baby and mother.

But apart from these issues, what about the ethics of fundraising off of “Florence”? Jodi Jacobson’s RH Reality Check raised $1.3 million last year. She herself took home $179,293 in pay. We’re told that “Florence” needs $1000 for an abortion out of state, so why didn’t Jacobson or her organization just cut a check? Would that not be theatrical enough?

If Abortion Is Only 3% Of Planned Parenthood’s Business …

Here are some headlines out of Texas in recent days:

Clinics in Fort Worth, other cities stop providing abortions, prepare to shut down

Clinics Close As Texas Abortion Fight Continues

Abortion Clinics Start Closing Across Texas

From the last story:

Planned Parenthood will close a dozen clinics on Friday after a federal appeals court reinstated most of the state’s controversial new abortion law. The ruling from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals late Thursday means that many abortion clinics across the state of Texas are required to stop providing the procedure immediately.

Planned Parenthood claimed in its request to the U.S. Supreme Court that more than one-third of the facilities in Texas were forced to stop providing care. They didn’t explain why some abortion doctors in Texas were able to get admitting privileges to local hospitals within three months of the new law’s passage and other abortion doctors weren’t.

But let’s not even get into those issues. Planned Parenthood frequently tells the media — and the media totally lap it up — that 97 percent of its business has nothing whatsoever to do with abortion. Pro-lifers have been debunking the statistic or otherwise treating it skeptically for years, but the claim is made repeatedly. Here‘s the Washington Post’s Ezra Klein buying into it. Earlier this year Amanda Marcotte at Slate wrote:

All together now: 97 percent of Planned Parenthood’s services are not abortion. Attacks on Planned Parenthood are, by definition, largely attacks on non-abortion services. Attacks on Planned Parenthood’s funding, regardless of claimed intent, are strictly attacks on contraception, STI testing/treatment, and cancer screenings.

So the question is obvious. If 97% of Planned Parenthood’s services aren’t abortion, why in the world would an abortion regulation cause a dozen Planned Parenthood clinics to close?

Closing clinics make for great headlines and more dramatic court briefs. But a media mildly more skeptical of savvy public relations campaigns and well-scripted legal wrangling might serve the public a bit more.",https://thefederalist.com/2013/11/18/planned-parenthoods-abortion-theater/,2013-11-18
Moving the Goalposts in Yemen,"August 2013: The United States allegedly intercepted a message between the emir of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Ayman al-Zawahiri, the current head of al-Qaida. Multiple prison breaks occurred throughout the region. To top it off, the Islamic holy month of Ramadan was ending. Officials acted quickly, closing more than 22 embassies worldwide for a period of time. The U.S. Embassy in Sana’a, Yemen, in particular, received focused attention: 12 tanks positioned near the building, surrounding roads completely shut down, checkpoints, and Yemen’s elite security forces deployed to the capital. As usual, Yemen is in the news.

A true discussion of the terrorism situation in Yemen, however, is incomplete without understanding the multiple threats to the interim Hadi regime, and before that, the long-lasting Salih regime. It’s too much to explain in a single paragraph the interplay between the Houthi rebellion in the northern part of the country, the southern secessionist movement, the constant attacks against Yemeni pipelines and security forces in the tribal areas, the myriad power players and handouts due to them, and, now, the constant specter of the previous Salih regime haunting any progress achieved by Yemen’s new leader.

Realizing this, the United States wisely has a two-pronged counterterrorism strategy in Yemen. First are the targeted strikes so widely discussed in the media, but the second prong, as the American Enterprise Institute explains it, is to “facilitate the establishment of a stable government in control of a unitary Yemeni state that is willing and able to combat AQAP.” This is a more complicated affair than it may seem. Yemen’s state is far from unitary, stable, willing, or able to combat the terrorism threat. The U.S. continues in this Sisyphean task, however, because of the urgent importance of neutralizing AQAP’s threat to the homeland.

Not to be undone, however, the administration seeks to confirm its commitment to nation-bolstering, publicizing what is in fact a comprehensive approach to not only Yemen’s security, but also its governance and development. Yemen, one of the poorest countries in the world, suffers chronic unemployment, poverty, infant mortality, and dwindling resources. At a 2012 speech to the Council on Foreign Relations, then-chief counterterrorism advisor John Brennan acknowledged this approach will take “many, many years” — perhaps an understatement.

But is that commitment tied utterly to the terrorism threat in Yemen? Likely.

Three years ago, in 2010, I was briefing a defense official regarding al-Qaida in Yemen when he cut in with a question.

“Why,” he asked, piercing me with a stare, “is Yemen suddenly so dangerous? Where in the last year did this threat come from?”

At the time, the question seemed incomprehensibly shortsighted. I had been focused on the terrorism threat in Yemen since 2004. Certainly, terrorism had been an issue for the country since before the USS Cole attack in 2000 and had never quite stopped. But the policymaker’s question revealed a powerful truth: we pay attention to Yemen only when it is an active theater of jihad.

Dear Yemen, we didn’t care about you before. And when this terrorism thing is over, we won’t care about you again.

When, though, will this ‘terrorism thing’ be over? Likely when 1.) AQAP no longer has transnational aspirations against the West and 2.) Sana’a is safe again for diplomats.

Where did this threat come from?

First, let me attempt to belatedly answer the official’s question.

Yemen became a threat to the United States with al-Qaida’s first known terrorist attack — an explosion in an Aden hotel targeted at US servicemen headed to Somalia. The bomb missed its target and instead killed two Australian tourists.

It was December 1992. Al-Qaida had been established three years before. Men connected to al-Qaida already had begun to plan the 1993 World Trade Center attack. Other associated men had assassinated right wing rabbi Meir Kahane in Manhattan in 1990. Al-Qaida had already taken up arms against US servicemen in Somalia.

But December 1992? That was the first instance of a coordinated terror attack planned and executed by an al-Qaida cell. It was not much of a success. And America didn’t take much notice.

Eight years later, a now well-established al-Qaida in Yemen attacked the USS Cole in Aden Harbor, killing 17 US sailors. Ten months earlier, the cell had attempted an attack on the USS The Sullivans, but failed — a plot only discovered after the USS Cole explosion. The investigation of the attack uncovered the truly transnational nature of al-Qaida, highlighting links to the 1998 East Africa embassy bombings and the Malaysia meeting between future 9/11 hijackers.

Al-Qaida at the time was a hub-and-spoke model. Abu Ali al-Harithi was the head of the Yemen spoke. In October 2002 he successfully orchestrated another maritime attack, this time against the French tanker Limburg. In November 2002 he became a smoking crater, courtesy of a Hellfire missile shot by a Predator drone.

For US policymakers, the al-Qaida threat in Yemen was, for all intents and purposes, dead.

Rising from the Ashes

They weren’t wrong. Cutting off the head of the snake withered the entire al-Qaida in Yemen cell. Al-Qaida did not conduct another major attack against US interests in Yemen until the embassy bombing in September 2008. One year later, the al-Qaida cell in Yemen sent Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to blow up an airliner over Detroit. Thus, the ‘sudden’ Yemeni threat.

What comprised the years between 2002 and 2008, however, was not complete barrenness. Al-Qaida in Iraq leader al-Zarqawi had authorized and endorsed attacks in Yemen in 2004 and 2005. Also, al-Qaida had moved from its hub-and-spoke model to a franchising model. No longer did the central organization pick regional leaders and direct attacks. Over time, a regional group emerged, under the leadership of Nassir al-Wahishi. For simplicity’s sake, some intelligence organizations referred to the group as AQY – al-Qaida in Yemen. However, the group did not get an official nod from al-Qaida until almost two years later.

Despite the lack of an official endorsement, AQY walked and talked like an al-Qaida group. Nassir al-Wahishi, a former secretary for bin Laden in Afghanistan, had escaped from a Political Security Office jail with 23 other people in February 2006. His shura council all had al-Qaida-linked transnational jihadist credentials. And the goal of the group was to overthrow the Yemeni regime. Over the next two years AQY would not only conduct attacks against the Salih regime but also against westerners in Yemen. By 2008 AQY was actively planning and executing attacks against the US embassy and diplomatic personnel in Sanaa.

But regional groups do not attract the attention of US policymakers when their activities are confined to their countries. That, perhaps, is a mistake. Even the September 2008 multiple Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device attack against the US Embassy in Sanaa was not enough for a wholescale shift in US counterterrorism policy in Yemen. The creation of a larger peninsular group — al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), comprised of the old AQY, a former split-off group, and a bunch of fugitive Saudi jihadists — did turn more heads. The US military presence in Yemen began to increase. But the hammer wasn’t lowered just yet.

Then came Anwar al-Awlaki, the dual US-Yemeni imam, a vocal advocate of violent jihad against the West. He had returned to Yemen in 2004 and had a few run-ins with Yemeni authorities and with prison sentences. But by 2009, al-Awlaki had become at the very least a prominent mouthpiece for AQAP. His going into hiding in March 2009 indicated a possibly more sinister connection. By his 2011 death, the United States was publicly referring to him as AQAP’s chief of external operations.

Al-Awlaki’s connection to AQAP began to reveal the group’s transnational aspirations. And that is when the US began to act. Under the Authorization for the use of Military Force (AUMF) against terrorists, the United States began authorizing drone strikes. The first was in December 2009. A week later, on Christmas Day, was the attempted bombing of NWA 253.

We know the rest of the story: the continued AQAP plots against the US, the continued drone strikes, the debate over targeted killings, the accusations that US counterterrorism actions were the very thing driving the al-Qaida threat from Yemen. However, regardless of who started it and who escalated it, one thing is now certain: Yemen is an active theater for jihad, and it is one battlefield in our War against Terror.

So, what’s our endgame?

But what does success in Yemen look like? Certainly, we can not hope to completely dismantle al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. Wahishi learned from al-Harithi’s mistakes. As the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point states:

Al-Wihayshi wanted to avoid this outcome the second time around. He adapted Bin Laden’s blueprint to fit the local context, appointing local amirs in different governorates across the country. Al-Harithi never accomplished that level of organization and delegation. Just like Bin Laden, al-Wihayshi constructed a durable infrastructure that was designed to survive the loss of key leaders.

We cannot hope to have total defeat of al-Qaida the way the Saudis managed to defeat al-Qaida in Saudi Arabia. Yemen, unlike Saudi Arabia, has nowhere near the central government reach nor the intelligence capabilities to disrupt cells over and again until no one is left. The complex structure of tribes, families, political allegiances, blood feuds, reparations, and rebellions in Yemen also mean we certainly can not be sure there will be a time ‘no one is left’. Even without a person’s steadfast adherence to al-Qaida, revenge for a cousin’s killing, for example, can drive activities in support of AQAP.

It may happen that al-Qaida cells will continue to take over southern Yemeni cities. Those cells may continue a pattern of jihad against Yemeni security forces. It may happen that Yemen will completely fail as a state. The question I often received when explaining those possibilities was, “Why do we care?” This was not a question asked dismissively, but rather, an invitation to explain why Yemen’s stability is important to the United States.

Hand-wringing over the radicalization of the Yemeni population, the political balance between the northern Huthi rebellion and the southern secessionists, the loss of potable water, the scourge of khat, the outrage over Yemeni child brides, and the general future fate of Yemen as a state misses the key point: right or wrong, the United States will no longer care when it has determined the threat from Yemen has disappeared. Yemen, the poorest Arab state, has no other strategic value to the US.

That is not to say foreign assistance and diplomatic relations will stop: of course not. But the complex multi-pronged strategy toward Yemen will not last when the United States feels secure regarding the threat emanating from its borders. Without a strident transnational threat, Yemen becomes less Pakistan and more Bangladesh.

What will that look like?

First, al-Qaida will no longer stage large-scale plots against the West out of Yemen. Note, I said “the West” itself not Western interests. We’re talking about Yemen being a safehaven for planning and training for transnational attacks.

It is possible this is already coming to fruition. Certainly, the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki and fellow American Samir Khan did not prevent AQAP’s plan to attack the United States in May 2012. The possible original driving forces of AQAP’s fight against the ‘far enemy’ are dead, but bombmaker Ibrahim al-Asiri is not.

In Yemen, the Obama administration’s focus on targeted killings has gone a long way toward eliminating much of the experienced, transnationally-minded AQAP leadership. The whack-a-mole approach to counterterrorism has its critics, and often rightfully so. Killing an operative will just lead to another operative to take his place. In the Yemeni case, however, those waiting in the wings are likely less inclined to plan large-scale attacks in the West. The death of Ibrahim al-Asiri and those he has trained would also eliminate a knowledge base. Al-Asiri allegedly was a target of an August 2013 strike, and was reportedly wounded.

In a 2011 paper published by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, the anonymous author — who continues fieldwork and cultivating contacts in the tribal regions of al-Jawf andMarib — takes a slightly different tack. The deaths of Americans Samir Khan and Anwar al-Awlaki, he argues, will do little to diminish the threat to the homeland, as transnational operations are now part of AQAP’s strategic plan. Instead:

AQAP’s unusually capable strategic decision making reveals that the group’s greatest asset is also its most glaring vulnerability. The most direct way to reduce the group’s viability in Yemen, while simultaneously limiting its capacity to attack the United States at home, lies in removing those Yemeni leaders responsible for the group’s operational coherence: Nasir `Abd al-Kareem `Abdullah al-Wahayshi, Qasim Yahya Mahdi al-Raymi, Muhammad Sa`id Ali Hasan al-’Umda and `Adil bin `Abdullah bin Thabit al-`Abab

Regardless of what exactly constitutes AQAP’s center of gravity in regards to homeland strikes, the same argument applies. Ridding Yemen of AQAP entirely is not the answer; targeting the infrastructure and personalities essential to AQAP’s strategy of transnational attacks is.

The administration’s alleged expansion of its ‘signature strike’ criteria to Yemen fits within this narrative, especially given the more stringent measures applied to such strikes in Yemen as opposed to in Pakistan: clear indication an AQAP senior operative’s presence or infrastructure indicating a terrorist training. If we are concerned about the personalities and infrastructure allowing for the planning and training for transnational attacks, taking out obvious training camps will also help eliminate lower-level individuals who may be poised to conduct such attacks.

AQAP, of course, does not just operate in a vacuum. The influence and direction of Ayman al-Zawahiri heavily impacts AQAP’s strategic direction and plans.

However, al-Zawahiri likely is capitalizing on the basic ingredients for transnational jihad already found within the terrorist group. Yemen’s al-Qaida cohort are the only ones in the past few years attempting and almost succeeding with large-scale attacks in the West. With the opportunity gone, al-Zawahiri will likely instead continue endorsing what al-Qaida’s plots have become: attacks against Western and host nation interests within a country, and small-scale attacks in the West.

The latter types of attacks are of the ‘open source jihad’ variety, a concept advocated by AQAP propagandist Samir Khan. Not planned or directed by al-Qaida, perpetrators of open-source jihad in the West are self-selecting and use al-Qaida merely as inspiration — Nidal Hassan and Fort Hood, for example.

The August 2013 worldwide shuttering of multiple Western embassies, allegedly based on a conversation between al-Zawahiri and Nassir al-Wahishi, underscore the former: attacks within a host country against the West. Targeted killings will likely not lead to the end of this threat, the bread and butter of most regional groups. Purportedly, the August 2013 threat was to foreign oil workers, a common target. Will we be able to make Yemen safe for Westerners? Likely not.

However, the force protection status of Sana’a, Yemen’s capital city, is illustrative of how far south the safety of westerners in Yemen has gone. American diplomats used to be able to live on the economy, shop at the local grocery store, and drive around without having to think of alternating routes for each trip. Then an AQY spinoff began active plans to attack the US Embassy. It almost succeeded in March 2008, with mortars missing their intended target and instead landing in the yard of the next-door girls’ school, killing two and wounding 19. The next month they attacked a fortified western housing compound, home to oil workers and to some embassy employees. In September multiple car bombs exploded at the embassy, killing 13 innocents.

Still, throughout the pattern of authorized departures and force protection restrictions, Sana’a still held a sense of security. Then the targeted attacks began within the capital city began. Four South Korean tourists had been killed at a site outside Sanaa in March 2009. Just three days later, in Sana’a, a suicide bomber targeted a convoy of South Korean investigators and relatives of the victims. In April 2010, British ambassador Tim Torlot survived a suicide bombing aimed at his car. That October, his deputy faced a mortar attack on her vehicle. Two years later, the 20-year security chief for the US Embassy, a Yemeni, was assassinated on his way to work. A year after that, this October 2013, a possible kidnapping plot against the German ambassador led to the death of her bodyguard outside a supermarket in an upscale neighborhood of the city.

It may not seem like a lot, but the attacks reflect the current security situation in the city. The feeling of siege continued with the massive violent protests outside the US embassy in 2012, during which a couple of hundred young men ripped the embassy’s sign from the outer wall, torched tires and a couple of vehicles, burned the American flag and breached the outer gates of the security entrance. A few months later, AQAP announced a $160,000 bounty in gold for the killing of the American ambassador to Yemen and $23,000 for the deaths of American soldiers in Yemen, in order “to encourage and inspire jihad.”

Today, US diplomats live in a sort of modified green zone, no longer residing in large houses in the upscale neighborhood on the other side of the city and instead camping out in buildings next to the embassy. For example, in recent years, only one hotel, the aging Sheraton near the embassy, was approved for visitors. This structure is now under the lease of the State Department.

Until Sanaa stops feeling like a war zone, Yemen’s plight may still hold the US’s attention. Perception is a powerful thing. Only continued coordination with the Hadi government and the full cooperation of the security officers, including the armed cop on the street, can ameliorate the situation. And that, on the end, may be the best argument for a multifaceted strategy toward Yemen.

Ten Foreign Policy Principles For The Next Republican Administration,"Events have a way of intruding themselves on political debates, and nowhere more than in the realm of foreign policy. Events are at it again.

In Eastern Europe, the crisis in Ukraine has taken a series of sudden, headline-grabbing turns, as the flight of Viktor Yanukovich and his government in the face of popular demonstrations has been followed by a Russian invasion of the Crimea. In Asia, tensions between Japan and China in the East China Sea escalated to the point where the two sides have been increasingly talking like imminent combatants; China is also testing its strength against the U.S. Navy. In Iraq, Fallujah has been retaken by Islamist radicals. In South America, popular demonstrations against Nicolás Maduro’s socialist government of Venezuela have faced harsh crackdowns. All of this takes place at a time when the Navy is cutting its deployment-ready aircraft carrier force (Britain is doing the same), the Army has been cutting combat brigades and is looking to shrink to its smallest size since 1940, and Obama Administration military planners seem to be drifting to a posture of de-emphasizing the need to be prepared to fight a war that would involve combat on the ground.

Republicans At The Drawing Board

These events are sure to push foreign affairs to the forefront of American political debate, at least for a week or two – and they will reverberate longer than that. Democrats may not have much internal debate at present; they are politically hemmed into defending the Obama Administration and will likely choose continuity by running Hillary Clinton in the next election (Hillary’s most likely primary opponent is Vice President Biden, who is even less likely to rethink the Administration’s choices). But the more things go wrong, the harder it will be for Obama’s first Secretary of State to run on her record.

On the Right, both personnel and policy are up for grabs. Events are already focusing attention on the foreign policy vacuum in the Republican Party and the conservative movement. That vacuum is unusual in the post-World War II history of the GOP and even more unusual in the conservative movement in that period. Republicans mostly committed to a hawkish, internationalist posture after Eisenhower defeated Taft for the 1952 Republican Presidential nomination, and renewed that posture (with an extra flavoring of neoconservative emphasis on promoting liberty abroad) when Reagan took control of the party after ousting Nixonian détente in the 1970s. When the 1990s “holiday from history” was ended abruptly by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the GOP and the conservative movement both largely fell in (with some vocal exceptions) behind a continuation of Reagan-era policies, applying similar ideas to what seemed like similar challenges. None of these approaches was its without its internal controversies, but at all times from 1952-2008, Republican voters could expect to hear on any issue of the day from a cadre of foreign policy veterans and pundits who provided continuity from one presidential administration to the next, who would appeal to a broadly-shared sense of America’s mission in the world, and who agreed that it had one. Indeed, the strength of the GOP’s brand on foreign affairs was crucial to most of its victories in national elections from 1952 to 2004.

Today, things have changed. The Bush Administration was mainly staffed at senior levels by people who cut their teeth in the Reagan, George H.W. Bush and even Nixon and Ford Administrations, and who saw the world through the lens of the hard lessons of the long twilight struggle of the Cold War; the same would have been true of a McCain Administration and to some extent a Romney Administration. But most of those senior figures are retired now. The party will enter 2016 having been out of power for eight years, and separated from the end of the Cold War by more than a quarter century. The GOP’s next presidential nominee is highly likely to be born in the 1960s or 1970s; as likely as not a governor (possibly one who has never served in Washington, DC); and more likely than not someone first elected to statewide office during the Obama years or at least the second Bush term. In the absence of a single frontrunner who can head off a contested primary, that means the party will have a real debate over its foreign policy posture as consequential as those in 1976 and 1952, and an even more wide-open one, with fewer candidates having extensive prior commitments. Some of the contenders, like Marco Rubio and Rand Paul, are associated with fairly well-known schools of thought, but the thinking of others, like Scott Walker, is almost entirely unknown. And the electorate increasingly consists of voters who don’t remember the Cold War, even voters who barely remember the early 2000s.

Welcome Back To The 19th Century

There is much wisdom to be re-learned from the foreign policy debates of the past – but the first lesson of this debate should be: don’t let ideology imprison you. Republican and conservative foreign policy debates have long been ideological in nature because they were constrained by particular conflicts, and therefore a candidate could make a few general pronouncements of ideals, and the voters could fill in the blanks and know where they stood on the spectrum in how they would respond to the great issues of the day. Most of the foreign policy debates of the past century have been conducted in such terms, in which everyone’s prior references were so well known that they hardly needed explanation.

But the first principle of foreign affairs is its absence of principle, or rather the need to never have our reactions and our options hamstrung by principle. This does not, by any stretch of the imagination, mean that ideas and ideologies have no proper place in foreign policy debates. There are many ideas with a long history of application in foreign affairs, and a track record of relative success or failure. The United States has permanent, long-term ideological goals: the destruction of tyrannies, the elimination of wars of territorial expansion and cross-border terrorism, and the spread of the American System: political liberty (democracy and republican self-governance), civil liberty (free speech, religious pluralism and free exercise of religion), economic liberty (free markets, free labor, free capital) and the stable and predictable rule of law. But the fact that these are long-range goals does not mean they should be boiled down into inflexible rules that prevent us from working to their apparent short-term detriment when the situation demands. In the real world, almost every significant foreign policy choice involves a choice of options in which every option sentences some innocent people to death and rewards some bad actors. If your foreign policy can be summarized on a bumper sticker, you will probably get in a lot of accidents.

The nature of our foreign policy responses must be tailored to the adversaries we face. Since 1941, Americans have grown accustomed to dealing with essentially ideological adversaries – the Nazis, the Communists, the Islamists, all of whom were motivated by an all-encompassing vision of a way of life that they asserted was better or more principled than our own. The natural counter-response to such an adversary has a strong ideological component: to demonstrate that the American System is, in fact, freer, better, fairer, stronger and more prosperous. This is precisely why the neoconservative freedom agenda was a natural fit in dealing with the opening stages of the “War on Terror.”

That counter-programming still matters to that fight, but the landscape is quite different now from where it was 13 years ago. While the battle against the Islamists rages on, it has entered a new phase with different dangers. Al Qaeda has regenerated itself and is possibly more dangerous than ever, but in a new way. Today, Al Qaeda and its allies rely less on top-down leadership and dependence on a geographic home base with state sponsorship, and appear to be de-emphasizing ambitious and complex plans like the 9/11 or Operation Bojinka plots in favor of more decentralized cells planning smaller attacks against softer targets on the model of the Boston Marathon Bombings. (One could argue that Bill Simmons’ Ewing Theory applies to Osama bin Laden: for all the splash he made, he provoked a powerful response that smashed his organization and base of support, whereas his loss made it more possible to pursue the kind of persistent, draining attacks that sap rather than invigorate the American public’s will to resist forcefully). Meanwhile, the Greater Middle East is already convulsed by popular revolutions that have acquired their own momentum. The region has its own power politics, as Iran and Saudi Arabia both exert themselves for regional influence. There is a strong case for some American role in these conflicts; but the collapse of the old strongman-centric order means that an American role will more often involve seeking proxies and playing balance-of-power politics.

And beyond the battle with the Islamists (and the few zealots like North Korea, Cuba and Venezuela), most of the challenges and dangers we face in the world today are more like those of the world of 1815-1918 than like the world of 1939-2010: rivalries for influence by relatively non-ideological actors like Russia and China, power politics within the EU, lingering sore spots like the India-Pakistan relationship, and the chaos-generating potential of serious internal problems in states like Mexico. And unlike the great European powers of the 19th and early 20th centuries, many of the key actors on the world stage – especially in the Northern Hemisphere – are driven today not by the ambitions of growing nations but the fears of old ones with aging populations and declining prospects. This may make them more rather than less dangerous, but also more apt to respond to incentives rather than seek confrontation for its own sake.

Does the promotion of liberty and the American System, in general, help us alleviate all of these problems? Of course. Do we still need a strong military and the ability to credibly threaten and use force when needed? Of course. But because these are not primarily ideological challenges, they require different solutions, ones that lean more heavily on traditional interest-based and balance-of-power realpolitik.

Much of the Iraq War debate was so unenlightening precisely because it was taken as an ideological litmus test for whether one supported preemptive war, or war based on WMD intelligence, or war to promote democracy or punish human rights violations.

One lesson is that Republicans will need to move beyond the Iraq War, and beyond the grooves it cut in foreign policy debates, just as we needed for many years to move beyond Vietnam. This is not because no lessons can be learned, but because, at the end of the day, the situation of the Iraq War is unlikely to recur. Much of the Iraq War debate was so unenlightening precisely because it was taken as an ideological litmus test for whether one supported preemptive war, or war based on WMD intelligence, or war to promote democracy or punish human rights violations. It’s true that the war was part of a broader grand strategy in the region; but it’s also true that the decision to go to war in Iraq could only be understood, or justified, when considering the entire picture – including among other things (1) the fact that the prior U.S. war with Iraq had never resulted in a stable peace, but was still subject to a cease-fire being violated by Iraq and being enforced, sporadically and at great expense, by American troops; (2) the fact that Iraq had, almost alone even among hostile regimes, openly celebrated the September 11 attacks in its state-run media; (3) the fact that Saddam’s regime was an ongoing state sponsor of terror that had previously hired terrorists to assassinate the first President Bush, was known to be financing suicide bombings against Israel and harboring a number of prominent terror figures; (4) the crucial strategic location and historic importance of Iraq to the Arab and Muslim worlds; and (5) the fact that the economic sanctions regime against Iraq had been pervasively compromised and corrupted. You may, or may not, regard these various considerations as justifications for the war – but they illustrate why future conflicts will raise their own host of situation-specific issues that will need to be considered on their own merits rather than according to inflexible ideological equations.

Likewise, in evaluating the decidedly mixed record of the Obama Administration, it should be clear that the Administration’s best moments have been when it disregarded impractical campaign rhetoric (for example, on surveillance and detention); its worst moments have been when it clung stubbornly to ideology, as when President Obama caved to Russian demands and abandoned a proposed missile defense agreement with Poland and the Czech Republic, with little to show in return. Obama, a supporter of the Nuclear Freeze movement in the early 1980s, never let go of his outdated hostility to missile defense, and that sent Russia a message that the President probably now regrets sending.

Rules For Beginning Anew

The basics remain important guideposts. I would suggest ten principles that should form a starting point for building a framework for the next Republican Administration’s foreign policy:

1. America comes first. The highest moral principle of every nation is the protection of its own people. We should never apologize for valuing our own people and our own interests first; that is the very definition of patriotism.

2. Might does not make right, but it makes responsibility. America can not and should not pursue the same foreign policy as a small nation, and if we do, we invite less responsible actors to expand their influence.

3. We have to pick our battles, or our battles will choose us. America, as the friend of freedom, has a long-term commitment to support other liberal democracies when they are endangered; but it can and should treat dictatorships as allies of convenience to be used when useful and discarded when not. Whatever our sympathies, we have neither the power nor the obligation to treat the struggle of every people for freedom as an equal priority at all times.

4. Victory over an enemy is the essence of war. The military should not be sent into any conflict in which it does not take sides and seek the defeat of an identified enemy. Wars should never be undertaken lightly, but when engaged, they must be pursued to victory.

5. All foreign policy is conflict, and all conflict is a substitute for war. Clausewitz observed that war is a continuation of politics by other means; we should likewise recall that all international politics – treaties, negotiations, economic sanctions – is war by other means, a struggle for power in which one should never overlook the possibility that disputes will lead to violence or fail to consider what we are and are not willing to fight for. There are ultimately only two kinds of treaties: ones you will go to war to enforce, and toilet paper. A treaty without a credible enforcement mechanism is purely optional.

6. Words are only as credible as the actions they ensure. The only credibility in international affairs that matters is the demonstrated willingness and ability to carry out your promises, and your threats; no government really cares if another government is telling the truth, and lessons taught by example are swiftly forgotten.

7. Foreign policy never exists in isolation. One of the greatest failures of U.S. policymaking, year in and year out, is the failure to bring all the many tools of U.S. influence to bear on disputes. This requires not just an analysis of the interrelation of military, trade, energy, intelligence, immigration, monetary, cultural and other policies but a willingness to employ a certain level of devious creativity in using the levers of power to get what we want at the least cost to ourselves. “Soft power” is often overrated, but that is because its American practitioners so often fail to treat it as power. We should want our enemies to awaken every morning wondering what we can do to them today; we should want those states that are rivals rather than enemies to see that cooperation will get them more from us than blackmail.

8. Geography still matters. The march of technology has led us to facile generalizations about the speed with which we can project influence, force or surveillance to any corner of the globe. In fact, having allies in strategic locations is still important – as counterweights to their neighbors, as sources of intelligence seasoned with local color, as a bulwark against the waning of official attention in Washington. The importance of these relationships is just one reason why bilateral alliances are still vastly more important than geographically disparate multilateral bodies. This was one thing President Bush understood deeply and for which he never got enough credit: the diligence he devoted to fostering strategically important and motivated allies like India, Japan, Israel, Australia, and Poland. Likewise, we still need bases to move troops and supplies, and ships to transport them.

9. Nations are people, too. For all the strategic missteps that are built into a democracy with a separation of powers, it can be tempting to see our adversaries as all-seeing strategic geniuses. In fact, we should never count out the possibility that our enemies will make mistakes – sometimes mistakes we can exploit, but also sometimes mistakes that will make them more dangerous both to themselves and others.

10. Be prepared for everything. If there is one lesson of history, it is that planners may sometimes be shrewd in foreseeing future crises, but they are terrible at predicting with certainty which problems will not recur. From land wars to terrorist attacks to and counter-insurgency, we need a military that has the flexibility to adapt to a variety of challenges nobody sees coming, and a political class with the humility to recognize that the world will make fools of campaign slogans.

These are guidelines; in international affairs, even the best lessons of history are ultimately a compass, not a straitjacket. Which is why the character and experience of our leaders is often just as important as their principles. But as Republicans, conservatives and libertarians look to the future, they will not have the option of clinging to slogans or to the reflexive oppositionism that has always been the first impulse of parties out of power. They will need to begin the hard work of explaining to a new generation of voters how they see the world and America’s place in it, and how they propose to lead it.

"Dude. Even If Benghazi Was About A Video, It's Still A Scandal","Judging from the reaction of liberals on my Twitter feed, the appropriate reaction to any #Benghazi talk is snickering and derision. And the defense offered by administration, which amounts to mocking conservatives for offering any questions – former National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor dropping “dude” on Fox News’ Bret Baier was tailored to parallel this dismissive attitude – reminds me that even if all this was about a video, even if the GOP’s “conspiracy theory” regarding talking-point timelines is all wrong, the Obama administration’s reaction is still a scandal.

By downplaying the Benghazi attack during the 2012 race, by grandstanding and attacking critics, the president saved himself any serious debate about, not only the attack, but our misguided Libyan intervention, our Egyptian policy, and the administration’s claims that al-Qaeda terrorism had been largely subdued. And by continuing to make the ludicrous assertion that a sophisticated tactical terrorist attack was merely a spontaneous protest by hypersensitive Muslims in reaction to a halfwit’s silly video, Obama defenders remind us that nothing is more important than politics.

From the beginning the administration misrepresented what occurred. And not only in Libya. When Judicial Watch recently made available documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act public, one of them, an email dated September 14, 2012, showed national security official Ben Rhodes editing Libya talking points for Susan Rice. Jay Carney (who initially claimed that these were “stylistic changes“) says the talking points reflected all protests across the Muslim world. The goal: “underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy.” But that’s a lie, no matter when the edit was made. It would have been a lie the night of Sept. 11 and it was a lie if Rice was referring to the entire Muslim world or simply Benghazi. And it’s a scandal because the administration knew it was untrue and went out and tacitly blamed the United States for the barbaric actions of others.

Remember the “protests” – as the administration and media characterized them – that broke out in Egypt that day. Thomas Joscelyn at Foundation for Defense of Democracies (h/t to Andrew C. McCarthy at NRO) writes that these protests “turned into an all-out assault on the compound, with the stars and stripes being ripped down and replaced by al Qaeda’a black banner. The protest-turned-assault was a pro-al Qaeda event from the first, with protesters openly praising Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda. I have identified at least three other senior al Qaeda-linked jihadists who helped spark the protest: Tawfiq Al ‘Afani, ‘Adel Shehato, and Rifai Ahmed Taha Musa.”

That sounds a lot like a premeditated “attack,” not merely a “protest.” It sounds like the embassy was under siege, left unprotected in a nation run by a Muslim Brotherhood government that the United States helped install into power. A political entity, which you may also remember, was being treated as some sort of moderate element in the Middle East by the administration. That’s a scandal.

You also remember the embassy’s apology?

The Embassy of the United States in Cairo condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims — as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions. Today, the 11th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, Americans are honoring our patriots and those who serve our nation as the fitting response to the enemies of democracy. Respect for religious beliefs is a cornerstone of American democracy.

Respect for religious beliefs is a cornerstone of American democracy? What baloney – especially coming from an administration that has consistently been hostile towards religious liberty. President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton even condemned the film on Pakistan television emphasizing that it was not produced or authorized by the United States government. Despicable “apologies” to the citizens of authoritarian nations should be a scandal in its own right.

First of all, the United States government should be actively defending the right of Americans to make stupid videos if they want. Not only does it have no right to make excuses for its citizens’ freedom of expression, it sets a dangerous precedent by doing so. The president probably reinforced the notion that the U.S. can control the political expression of its citizens. He likely made the existence of this so-called movie known to millions of Mulsims who’d never even heard of it. (We won’t even get into the jailing of the maker of “Innocence of Islam” or the government “asking” companies to remove the trailer, which is a baby step away from actual censorship.) And, as we now know, this was all done for political cover.

That’s a scandal worth talking about.

Can Hillary Clinton Recover From Her Support Of The Iraq War?,"With the news that Condoleeza Rice has been hounded from a commencement speaking engagement at Rutgers University by left-wing faculty and student protests on the grounds that Rice “had played ‘a prominent role in the administration’s effort to mislead the American people about the presence of weapons of mass destruction’ in Iraq,” the question that haunted Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign must be asked again: can the Democratic base ever forgive her support for launching that war? The answer, in all likelihood, is that the Democratic Party’s base will forgive and forget – not only out of political expediency and ignorance of history but because, deep in their hearts, they do not really believe their own extreme rhetoric about the Iraq War.

Hawks of a Feather

Unquestionably, if you take the campaign against Rice on its own terms – that “misleading” the nation to war over Saddam’s WMD programs is a war crime or something like it, making one ineligible to be received in polite company – Hillary is similarly guilty. Consider how then-Senator Clinton herself justified that vote:

In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda members, though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of September 11, 2001.



It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons. Should he succeed in that endeavor, he could alter the political and security landscape of the Middle East, which as we know all too well affects American security.



…In the case of Iraq, recent comments indicate that one or two Security Council members might never approve force against Saddam Hussein until he has actually used chemical, biological, or God forbid, nuclear weapons.



…While the military outcome is not in doubt, should we put troops on the ground, there is still the matter of Saddam Hussein’s biological and chemical weapons. Today he has maximum incentive not to use them or give them away. If he did either, the world would demand his immediate removal. Once the battle is joined, however, with the outcome certain, he will have maximum incentive to use weapons of mass destruction and to give what he can’t use to terrorists who can torment us with them long after he is gone. We cannot be paralyzed by this possibility, but we would be foolish to ignore it. And according to recent reports, the CIA agrees with this analysis.



…perhaps my decision is influenced by my eight years of experience on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue in the White House watching my husband deal with serious challenges to our nation. I want this President, or any future President, to be in the strongest possible position to lead our country in the United Nations or in war…I want to insure that Saddam Hussein makes no mistake about our national unity and for our support for the President’s efforts to wage America’s war against terrorists and weapons of mass destruction.



…Over eleven years have passed since the UN called on Saddam Hussein to rid himself of weapons of mass destruction as a condition of returning to the world community. Time and time again he has frustrated and denied these conditions.

The hairsplitting defense typically offered by those who wish to drive Rice and other senior Bush officials from civilized society while pledging their votes, money and support to make Hillary the next President is that Hillary was just one Senator, following the Bush Administration’s lead. Now, if you regard the Iraq War as a question of ordinary politics and statesmanship, that might be a defense, albeit one that shouldn’t inspire confidence in Hillary’s judgment among diehard critics of the war. But if your actual, serious opinion is that the war is some sort of war crime, “I was only following the leaders” is pretty well-recognized as not being a defense.

And besides that, Hillary was not just any Senator. She had been the First Lady of the recently-departed Administration for eight years, and as her floor speech alluded, she was trading on the credibility that came from her husband dealing with intelligence reports on Saddam’s WMD programs throughout those years. Moreover, the Democrats were leaderless and deeply divided in 2002. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, Senate Majority Whip Harry Reid, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, 2000 Vice Presidential nominee Joe Lieberman and 1988 presidential candidate Joe Biden were supporting the war, but 2000 Presidential nominee Al Gore, House Minority Whip Nancy Pelosi, and Senate “liberal lion” Ted Kennedy were opposed. In that setting, the Clintons – the first two-term Democratic president since FDR and his wife – were still de facto the most popular and influential figures in the party. A vigorous statement of opposition to the war by Hillary, bearing at least the implicit imprimatur of her husband (her chief national security adviser at the time), would have carried enormous weight. And with Democratic control of the Senate until the 2002 elections, those votes were critical

Why did she choose, instead, to support and justify a war that Democratic partisans now regard as a war crime, beyond the pale of civilized discourse and disagreement? The New York Times suggested in 2007 that it was her fear of gender politics: “Clinton knew she could never advance her career — or win the presidency, especially — if she didn’t prove that she was tough enough to be commander in chief. Female candidates, it’s presumed, have often suffered as a result of the stereotype that they could never be as strong as men.” That’s a terrible reason to vote to send a nation to war. But as her speech and conduct at the time made clear, there was likely more that went into her thinking than that – thinking not so different, after all, from that of the Bush Administration.

I Read Your Book

In 1998, in the midst of a decade of sanctions on Saddam’s regime, WMD intelligence combined with Saddam’s refusal to cooperate with required weapons inspections had led President Clinton to launch a large-scale air strike against Iraq aimed entirely at suspected WMD sites, as described by President Clinton’s Defense Secretary at the time:

During the course of DESERT FOX, American and British war planes flew more than 650 strike and strike support sorties. Our ships launched more than 325 Tomahawk cruise missiles and U.S. Air Force B-52s launched more than 90 cruise missiles. In all, we attacked almost 100 targets, all related to our overall mission objectives….With respect to the manufacture of chemical and biological agents, as I’ve indicated time and time again, our goal was to diminish his capacity to deliver such chemicals or biological or even nuclear weapons and to strike those facilities we could identify that possibly solely produced them. But we were always conscious of the fact that you could have a facility inside of a hospital or a fertilizer plant, a dual use facility, and we took that into account in seeking to balance the need to reduce his capacity to pose a threat to the region and at the same time, not engaging in the wholesale destruction of the Iraqi people.

The conclusion from that presser? It wasn’t over:

Q: Secretary Cohen, regarding the inspectors, in addition to the UNSCOM inspectors, who call themselves in effect, the IA — International Atomic Energy Agency Inspectors, have also been required to leave Iraq and it’s believed by some they also may not be able to return. And those inspectors were widely considered effective. I mean, is that a price you’re going to have to pay, now having done what you’ve done?

A: Saddam will have to make a determination as to whether or not he’s prepared to fully cooperate with those inspectors as well. To the extent that they remain outside of Iraq, there will be no chance of closing any files in the future. And so, the sanctions, again, will continue to remain in place. So he does not benefit from keeping them out, and he does not benefit from keeping the UNSCOM team out either.

Q: He benefits in terms of an ease[ing] in developing a nuclear program.

A: Well, we are going to continue to watch him very closely. We have — we will make every effort to compensate for the lack of those inspectors. But by the same token, he is going to be precluded from getting relief from the sanctions and that is very important to him. He wanted to get the inspectors out and get relief from the sanctions. He may have gotten the inspectors out at least temporarily. He will not get relief from the sanctions.

Q: Do you think it’s just a matter of time before the United States will have to conduct another such operation against Iraq?

A: Wouldn’t want to speculate on that. We’re prepared to conduct future military operations, but that will depend upon Saddam’s actions.

Of course, those actions had not improved between 1998 and 2002; that’s one reason why even Gore, in a debate with George W. Bush in 2000, had pledged that “I want to give robust support to the groups that are trying to overthrow Saddam Hussein.” The intelligence community throughout the United States and around the globe, from one country to the next, agreed in 1998 and still agreed in 2002 that Saddam had non-trivial WMD capabilities and was scheming to obtain more, and scores of leading Democrats believed the same thing. That was the view of the Clinton Administration before Desert Fox, and it continued to be the view of U.S. and foreign intelligence agencies after Desert Fox:

[T]he German Federal Intelligence Service held the bleakest view of all, arguing that Iraq might be able to build a nuclear weapon within three years. Israel, Russia, Britain, China, and even France held positions similar to that of the United States; France’s President Jacques Chirac told Time magazine [in February 2003], “There is a problem—the probable possession of weapons of mass destruction by an uncontrollable country, Iraq. The international community is right … in having decided Iraq should be disarmed.”

Indeed, Saddam’s possession of usable stocks of WMD was believed at the time by senior figures in Iraq’s own military, who were stunned when Saddam disclosed to them in December 2002 that he lacked chemical or biological stockpiles. And from what we learned later on, much of the fault for misunderstanding lay with Saddam himself. He contended, after his capture, that he had deliberately tried to give the appearance of having WMD in order to deter Iran. Ironically, later U.S. analyses found that Saddam’s frantic efforts to scrub former WMD sites in order to give selective access to inspectors had been interpreted as a different kind of cover-up. The very scope of Saddam’s earlier WMD programs made the task of securing all its weapons daunting – a Wikileaks release of previously-secret documents in 2010 illustrated that “for years after [2003], U.S. troops continued to find chemical weapons labs, encounter insurgent specialists in toxins and uncover weapons of mass destruction”:

In August 2004, for instance, American forces surreptitiously purchased what they believed to be containers of liquid sulfur mustard, a toxic “blister agent” used as a chemical weapon since World War I. The troops tested the liquid, and “reported two positive results for blister.” The chemical was then “triple-sealed and transported to a secure site” outside their base.



…Meanwhile, the second battle of Fallujah was raging in Anbar province. In the southeastern corner of the city, American forces came across a “house with a chemical lab … substances found are similar to ones (in lesser quantities located a previous chemical lab.” The following day, there’s a call in another part of the city for explosive experts to dispose of a “chemical cache.”



Nearly three years later, American troops were still finding WMD in the region. An armored Buffalo vehicle unearthed a cache of artillery shells “that was covered by sacks and leaves under an Iraqi Community Watch checkpoint. “The 155mm rounds are filled with an unknown liquid, and several of which are leaking a black tar-like substance.” Initial tests were inconclusive. But later, “the rounds tested positive for mustard.”

And what Saddam was actually doing was hardly harmless. For example, the Congressional testimony of Iraq Study Group head David Kay emphasized some of the threats presented even by a more accurate post-invasion picture of what Saddam had been up to:

Iraq made determined efforts to retain some capabilities for biological warfare. It maintained an undeclared network of laboratories and other facilities within the apparatus of its security services, and as Kay put it, “this clandestine capability was suitable for preserving BW expertise, BW-capable facilities, and continuing R&D—all key elements for maintaining a capability for resuming BW production.” To disguise its biological-warfare programs Baghdad had scientists working on overt projects that were closely related to proscribed activities.



Iraq seemed to have been most aggressive in pursuing proscribed missiles. In Kay’s words, “detainees and cooperative sources indicate that beginning in 2000 Saddam ordered the development of ballistic missiles with ranges of at least [240 miles] and up to [620 miles] and that measures to conceal these projects from [UN inspectors] were initiated in late 2002, ahead of the arrival of inspectors.” The Iraqis were also working on clustering liquid-fueled rocket engines in order to produce a longer-range missile, and were trying to convert certain surface-to-air missiles into surface-to-surface missiles with a range of 150 miles. Most troubling of all, the ISG uncovered evidence that from 1999 to 2002 Iraq had negotiated with North Korea to buy technology for No Dong missiles, which have a range of 800 miles.

Even after his capture, Saddam insisted to his FBI interrogator that he had planned to reconstitute his entire WMD program – chemical, biological, and nuclear. His efforts to corrupt and emasculate the sanctions regime gave him hope – not an irrational hope – that this strategy would prevail.

Subsequent efforts to condemn the truthfulness of the Bush Administration and the Blair and Howard governments in the U.K. and Australia have tended to focus on the existence of disagreements in the intel community over particular pieces of evidence and the timelines that could be drawn from them. And indeed, there were many such dissents at the time, and more than a few items of evidence that look flimsy or worse with hindsight. But the trees should not be mistaken for the forest. The people who thought the intelligence was completely wrong about Saddam’s WMD programs were, for the most part, people who had no clearance to read any of it. Even Barack Obama, who defeated Hillary in 2008 in part by deploying the Iraq vote against her, refused when running for the Senate in 2004 to say he would have voted against the Iraq War if he had had access to classified intelligence at the time, and insisted, as the battle shifted to countering the insurgency, that “There’s not much of a difference between my position on Iraq and George Bush’s position at this stage” – hardly the language of a crime against humanity. Even Obama had to resort to revisionist history on the issue of WMD intelligence; there’s no record of him questioning before the war whether Saddam had WMD. Here’s what State Senator Obama said at the time:

Now let me be clear – I suffer no illusions about Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal man. A ruthless man. A man who butchers his own people to secure his own power. He has repeatedly defied UN resolutions, thwarted UN inspection teams, developed chemical and biological weapons, and coveted nuclear capacity….Let’s fight to make sure that the UN inspectors can do their work, and that we vigorously enforce a non-proliferation treaty, and that former enemies and current allies like Russia safeguard and ultimately eliminate their stores of nuclear material, and that nations like Pakistan and India never use the terrible weapons already in their possession, and that the arms merchants in our own country stop feeding the countless wars that rage across the globe.

In the end, the argument against American policymakers, in the Bush and Clinton camps alike, is that they committed a war crime by failing to read more closely and skeptically the particulars of specific items of evidence in order to call into question the intra- and inter-governmental consensus. But if that is your thesis, it’s hard to excuse Senator Clinton, who apparently did not even read the 90-page National Intelligence Estimate, according to some reports due to the fact that she only had 10 days in which to read it. Given that the NIE was less than a tenth the length of the Affordable Care Act, one is nostalgic for the days when Senators were asked to do so much less reading – and yet, it was too much for her to digest.

Causes and Reasons

If anything, Senator Clinton’s reliance on the WMD rationale is considerably more culpable, viewed through the lens of “war guilt,” than that of the Bush Administration, because it was much more central to her decision. Liberal ire over WMD intelligence was so acute because Democrats and liberals who did support the war – Hillary among them – did so almost entirely as an exercise in disarmament, consistent with the broader liberal tendency to view both war and crime as a question of weaponry rather than a question of behavior.

By contrast, conservative and Republican supporters of the war inside and outside the Bush Administration always saw the WMD issue as merely one part of a broader set of arguments for war. I’ve previously addressed the grand strategy behind that view, which focused on igniting a disruptive regional revolution that would unsettle the corrupt and oppressive status quo across the Greater Middle East and end the dynamic by which that region’s “secular” and religious leaders alike directed terrorism outwards in order to distract from their stagnant despotisms at home. But there were specific reasons as well, which fall under three general headings:

1. The U.S. and Iraq were still formally at war in 2002. The 1991 Gulf War did not end with a peace treaty; it ended with a cease-fire conditioned on Iraq’s compliance with a number of U.N. resolutions, and Iraq was failing to comply with several of those, including shooting at U.S. airplanes enforcing the no-fly zone, refusing to cooperate with weapons inspections, and funding Palestinian terrorists outside its borders. Every element of the decision to go to war with Iraq in 2002-03 must be evaluated in light of this posture. The issue in 2002 was not whether to pre-emptively invade a nation with which we were at peace, but whether to accept, after a decade of Saddam flouting these terms, that we simply would not enforce them – with all the consequences that entailed for the credibility of future agreements with the U.S.

2. Saddam cheered the 9/11 attacks and openly supported terrorism. The September 11 terrorist attacks were such an unprovoked atrocity that regimes around the world, even those implacably hostile to the United States, rushed to offer their support, their sympathy, or at least their willingness to disassociate themselves from the attacks. Almost alone in the world, though, Iraq’s state-run media openly celebrated the attacks while the wounds were still raw. The Ba’athist regime put up murals cheering the attacks. While even Qaddafi, Arafat and (disingenuously) the Taliban were offering condolonces, Saddam was gloating:

Saddam Hussein’s Iraq said the United States deserved Tuesday’s attacks in New York and Washington as the fruits “of its crimes against humanity.”



Under the headline “America burns,” the official newspaper Al-Iraq said that “what happened in the United States yesterday is a lesson for all tyrants, oppressors and criminals.”



Overnight an official Iraqi statement said: “The American cowboys are reaping the fruit of their crimes against humanity.”

For myself, I took rather personally people cheering for attempts at murdering me. President Bush undoubtedly felt the same way, given that Saddam had hired terrorists to blow up George H.W. Bush on a 1993 visit to Kuwait:",https://thefederalist.com/2014/05/19/can-hillary-clinton-recover-from-her-support-of-the-iraq-war/,2014-05-19
Who Is Jihadist Mehdi Nemmouche?,"News that the suspected perpetrator of the Brussels Jewish Museum shooting is a French jihadist veteran of the Syrian war has added to what were already growing concerns about the dangers posed by European fighters returning from Syria. Media reports, following the lead of European officials, have focused on the threat to Europe. (For an example from CNN, see here.) But closer consideration of the Brussels attack and its precedents shows that threats in Europe are not necessarily threats to Europe per se: Jews (civilians) and Americans (military personnel) remain the preferred targets of Islamic terrorists who strike on the European continent.

The suspect, Mehdi Nemmouche, was arrested by customs agents in Marseille on May 30 during a routine check of a bus arriving from Amsterdam. Six days earlier, at the Jewish Museum in the central Sablon neighborhood of Brussels, a lone gunman shot dead two Israeli tourists with a revolver before coolly removing a Kalashnikov from a gym bag and killing one museum employee and fatally wounding another. Among Nemmouche’s possessions, French police discovered not only the presumed murder weapons, but also a homemade flag featuring the insignia of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), the powerful al-Qaeda splinter group that now controls large swathes of both Syria and Iraq.

Only sketchy details are known thus far about the path that took the 29-year-old native of Roubaix from a juvenile career of petty delinquency to jihadist militancy and ultimately, it seems, terror. According to Paris public prosecutor François Molins, Nemmouche was convicted of no less than seven crimes—including several thefts and armed robberies—committed between early 2004, when he was 18, and the end of 2007. It was during his last and longest period of incarceration, from December 2007 to December 2012, that Nemmouche discovered and embraced radical Islam, thus confirming the longstanding reputation of French prisons as incubators of Islamic extremism.

The Making Of A Terrorist

Headshots of Nemmouche published by the French weekly Paris Match illustrate his transformation. The first photo, taken in 2007, shows a clean-cut young man with a blank stare. The photo appears to have been taken following one of his many arrests that year. In the second photo, taken in 2011 at the Toulon La Farlède penitentiary, Nemmouche has roughly the same blank stare, but he is now sporting a bushy beard trimmed precisely according to the specifications of the sharia.

This confirms the longstanding reputation of French prisons as incubators of Islamic extremism.

In September 2011, Nemmouche is known to have written to the Sanabil association, a charity founded to provide aid to Muslim prisoners, requesting several religious texts, including “the hadiths concerning the sunna on the trimming of a beard longer than the breadth of four fingers.” The “hadiths” are accounts of the sayings and doings of Mohammed, from which is derived the sunna: the set of customary norms that are supposed to serve as a guide for pious Muslims.

Undoubtedly of greater significance for Nemmouche’s future development, he is known also to have requested texts regarding the nature of kufr or “unbelief.” The issue of what constitutes “major unbelief” (kufr akbar) as opposed to merely “minor unbelief” is a central preoccupation of the ultra-conservative “Salafist” current of Islamic thought to which al-Qaeda and its many contemporary offshoots adhere. The issue concerns not those who are kuffar or “infidels” by definition, such as Jews or Christians, but rather precisely other Muslims, who can be denounced as apostates for committing acts that exhibit “major unbelief.”

In particular, secular Arab rulers like Syrian president Bashar al-Assad—as well as a highly unorthodox Muslim ruler like the late Libyan “guide” Muammar al-Qaddafi—have long been denounced as apostates by Salafists. It is this charge of apostasy that fuels the fervor of the jihadist groups fighting to overturn Assad’s rule.

Judging from chronology, it would appear Nemmouche was even recruited to join the Syrian jihad while in prison.

But Nemmouche was not only radicalized in prison. Judging from chronology, it would appear he was even recruited to join the Syrian jihad while in prison. If not, then he took the decision and arranged for the logistics remarkably fast. Nemmouche was released from prison on December 4, 2012. According to the account provided by the Paris public prosecutor, he left for Syria “just three weeks later.”

On March 19, 2012, while Mehdi Nemmouche was still incarcerated at the Toulon La Farlède penitentiary, a 23-year-old jihadist wannabe by the name of Mohamed Merah pulled up in front of a Jewish school in Toulouse on a stolen motorbike and proceeded to execute three Jewish children, aged three to eight, and a schoolteacher. Three days later and following a siege of some 32 hours, Merah himself would be killed by police in a shootout. A prison guard from Toulon La Farlède has told Paris-Match that Nemmouche—who otherwise declined to have a television in his cell on religious grounds—specially requested a television on that occasion so he could follow the siege.

Patterns Of Terrorism

Numerous similarities suggest that Nemmouche drew inspiration for the Brussels Jewish Museum attack from Merah’s 2012 attack on the Ozar Hatorah school in Toulouse: Not only the choice of targets, but also, for instance, Nemmouche’s use of a wearable “Go Pro” video camera to film his attack. Merah also used a Go Pro camera to film his attacks, in the hope that the video would be broadcast by the satellite channel Al-Jazeera. (According to his own apparent declarations in a separate video discovered by police, Nemmouche’s attempt to film his attack failed.)

Merah also used a Go Pro camera to film his attacks, in the hope that the video would be broadcast by the satellite channel Al-Jazeera.

The Brussels Jewish Museum attack clearly demonstrates the danger that returning jihadists represent in Europe. But especially in light of the similarities with Merah’s 2012 attack, it also reminds us that while jihadists do indeed represent a danger in Europe, the threat in question does not necessarily target Europe or European countries per se.

Individual European countries have become a target for jihadists for strategic reasons (e.g. the involvement of Spain and the UK in the US-led coalition in Iraq) or purely conjunctural ones (e.g. the publication of the “Mohammed cartoons”). In the run-up to the massacre at the Ozar Hatorah school, Merah himself killed three French paratroopers in two separate attacks: attacks he explicitly linked to the French presence in Afghanistan.

Yes, They Really Hate Us

Hostility towards Jews, however, has a more fundamental, well-nigh metaphysical significance in jihadist ideology. Perhaps only hostility toward America and Americans—with which this Jew-hatred is typically paired—has a similar status. Thus, it is notable that, apart from Merah’s killings of the French paratroopers, all the other so-called lone-wolf Islamist terror attacks that have taken place in Europe in recent years have targeted Americans or Jews: Arid Uka’s 2011 killing of American servicemen at the Frankfurt Airport, Merah’s 2012 attack on the Ozar Hatorah school in Toulouse, and now the attack on the Brussels Jewish Museum.

Another example is provided by the so-called Sauerland Cell. The group of young German Muslim converts and Germans of Turkish origin had been stocking explosives for an attack on American military facilities in Germany when their plot was broken up in September 2007.

And then there are the numerous Islamic terror attacks around the world that have been carried out or facilitated by European-based extremists: from Bali to the Tunisian island of Djerba to New York and Washington. The 9/11 attacks, after all, were largely planned in Hamburg. If America ignores the newest generation of European jihadists being forged in the crucible of the Syrian war, it will do so at its own peril.

Six Photo Ops President Obama Is ‘Not Interested In’,"“This isn’t theater. This is a problem,” he added. “I’m not interested in photo ops, I’m interested in solving a problem.”—President Obama

When asked about the border crisis, President Obama had the audacity to note that he isn’t interested in “photo ops.” That’s certainly an odd statement for a man who appeared on Between Two Ferns and slow-jammed the news with Jimmy Fallon. But it’s true—there are at least six photo ops this president prefers to ignore or wait until he learns about them on CNN.

1. Night of the Benghazi Attack Photo Op

Unlike the photo released for the night of the Osama bin Laden attack, there is neither photo nor evidence of President Obama’s whereabouts for the night of the Benghazi attack. He did appear at a Las Vegas fundraiser the next day. Perhaps a YouTube video is the culprit for this missing photo.

2. The IRS Photo Op

Despite Lois Lerner’s professed loyalty and unending fandom of the Democrat Party, and her future aspirations for a job at Obama for America, we have no evidence of a recent photo of her and the president. Being under investigation for using the iron fist of the IRS to punish a certain administration’s enemies might make this a less-than-popular photo opportunity for the president. There’s not even a hashtag from FLOTUS to #BringBackourEmails.

3. Bowe Bergdahl’s Platoon Members Photo Op

These American soldiers went on TV to question the premise of trading highly valued enemy combatants for one single American soldier who, by all evidence available, appears to have deserted his unit. Emptying out Gitmo is clearly a higher priority than explaining the logic of this decision to the American people or Bergdahl’s fellow platoon members.

4. The VA Photo Op

You won’t find the president getting photos taken with this guy. Not after the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has been found under his watch to overpay people by millions of dollars to defraud and let veterans die before getting care:

The scandal-plagued Department of Veterans Affairs is systematically overpaying clerks, administrators and other support staff, according to internal audits, draining tens of millions of dollars that could be used instead to ease the VA’s acute shortage of doctors and nurses….Rather than moving quickly to correct these costly errors, VA officials two years ago halted a broad internal review mandated by federal law. As a result, the overpayments continue.

What are we getting for spending all this money on the VA?

The Examiner reported earlier this month that more than 1.5 million VA medical orders nationwide were canceled in the past year without any guarantee the veterans received the care that had been ordered. Many of those orders for tests, specialist visits or other services were closed without any evidence in the case files that they had been individually reviewed, or that the patient or doctor was contacted.

Comprehensive reform of the VA system should be a top priority for this nation.

5. The Border Photo Op

Thousands of illegal immigrants are being housed at various locations on the U.S. Border. Sparked by this administration’s policy of not enforcing the law, we have a humanitarian crisis in our hemisphere:

Back in 2010 the bodies of 72 Central American migrants were found on a ranch in northern Mexico. The 58 men and 14 women had apparently been kidnapped by drug gangs, possibly to rob them or perhaps to demand money from relatives. For whatever reason they did not survive. But even those children and adults who survive the 1,000 mile trip do not always do so unmolested. Last month CNN interviewed a 17-year-old girl who was ganged raped for ‘several hours’ after being told that if she complained she would be murdered. In a single week in March of this year, Mexican officials found 370 children, the youngest just 9-years-old, who had been abandoned by the coyotes they were traveling with.

President Obama declined to visit the border while in Texas last week. Instead, he had some BBQ in Austin after a vigorous game of pool in Denver, Colorado and a chance encounter with this guy while ignoring the national press’ request for more transparency.

6. The ‘Leading From Behind’ Photo Op

A commercial plane with American passengers flying at 33, 000 feet was downed by Russian weapons Thursday:

This is becoming rather too regular an occurrence to be ignored. The deaths of all those innocent passengers and crew aboard the Malaysian aircraft, who were in no way party to this conflict, makes it impossible for the West to look away from Russian aggression or for Russia to escape culpability. Even if the shooting down of the Malaysian aircraft was accidental and not ordered by the Kremlin, as seems likely, Vladimir Putin is nevertheless ultimately responsible. If you hand a bazooka to a hyperactive teenager and he destroys your neighbor’s house, the person providing the weapon is just as culpable as the one firing it.

The president of United States moves on from noting that nearly 300 people killed “may be a terrible tragedy” to hectoring for more funding for infrastructure.

This isn’t just a photo op President Obama doesn’t want, it’s a crisis he cannot handle. Consider instead President Reagan’s “Address to the Nation on the Soviet Attack on a Korean Civilian Airliner“:

My fellow Americans: I’m coming before you tonight about the Korean airline massacre, the attack by the Soviet Union against 269 innocent men, women, and children aboard an unarmed Korean passenger plane. This crime against humanity must never be forgotten, here or throughout the world. Our prayers tonight are with the victims and their families in their time of terrible grief. Our hearts go out to them—to brave people like Kathryn McDonald, the wife of a Congressman whose composure and eloquence on the day of her husband’s death moved us all. He will be sorely missed by all of us here in government. The parents of one slain couple wired me: `Our daughter . . . and her husband . . . died on Korean Airline Flight 007. Their deaths were the result of the Soviet Union violating every concept of human rights.” The emotions of these parents—grief, shock, anger—are shared by civilized people everywhere. From around the world press accounts reflect an explosion of condemnation by people everywhere. Let me state as plainly as I can: There was absolutely no justification, either legal or moral, for what the Soviets did. One newspaper in India said, `If every passenger plane . . . is fair game for home air forces . . . it will be the end to civil aviation as we know it.’

The comparison speaks for itself. Unlike Reagan, President Obama figured this was a good time to pivot back to jokes about Delaware.

Meanwhile, Russia’s Vladimir Putin isn’t taking responsibility for the effects of Russian weapons. At least Putin didn’t blame House Republicans. We’ll see how this develops, but based on Obama’s preference to avoid the tough issues, this likely won’t be a future photo-opportunity.

The Ferguson-9/11 Nexus,"As the riots and unrest in Ferguson recede, the Obama administration has embarked on a new adventure in Iraq, this time against the Islamic State (ISIS), hitting the terrorist enclave in Iraq with a handful of airstrikes in recent weeks. Although President Obama admitted “we don’t have a strategy yet” for confronting ISIS, the United States nevertheless has begun recruiting a broader coalition of allies to carry out attacks against the group in Syria and widen operations against it in Iraq.

Meanwhile, many Americans have come away from the riots in Ferguson, Missouri deeply disturbed by the militarization of local police departments, not just in that town but nationwide. Images of cops in armored vehicles training military-grade rifles on unarmed protestors and firing tear gas into crowds struck many as repugnant and alarming—scenes better suited to mass protests in Egypt, Ukraine, or Turkey.

So what does our response to ISIS have to do with the police response to Ferguson? Last week, Peter Suderman of Reason argued the militarized police response in Ferguson directly results from America’s response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11. The federal programs that supplied the armored vehicles, body armor, tear gas, rubber bullets, and other military gear in Ferguson were meant to help cops fight terror at the local level.

It’s a bit much to say, as Suderman does, that far from fighting terror, the police in Ferguson “have helped create it,” but it’s certainly true that over the past decade local police departments nationwide have been outfitted with an unprecedented array of military gear and training. Never before have so many cops had so much military hardware as they do now, most of it supplied by the federal government.

The American Street War

Arming cops with heavier firepower began decades ago with the War on Drugs, but Suderman rightly notes that the attacks of 9/11, the War on Terror, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq accelerated the trend by many orders of magnitude:

A federal program began transferring large military grade equipment from the Pentagon to local law enforcement—giving away almost $450 million worth of equipment originally intended for conducting war last year alone. Since 2002, a separate program run by the Department of Homeland Security has provided $35 billion in grants to law enforcement around the country, funding the purchase of tactical gear, storm-trooper-style armor, and mine-resistant vehicles.

Radley Balko has had some fun chronicling the distribution of Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected armored personnel vehicles, or MRAPs, to small towns like Dundee, Mich., population 3,600. But it’s not just small towns. Last year, Ohio State University acquired its very own a 19-ton MRAP. It was just one of more than 100 colleges whose campus police are getting military-grade hardware from the Department of Defense.

It became clear that giving military gear to cops just meant more local police departments would form SWAT teams.

The idea is that local cops must be prepared to disrupt terrorist plots and therefore should be trained and equipped accordingly. In the wake of 9/11, when Americans were in shock and afraid there might be more attacks on the way, this reasoning kind of made sense. But as the years wore on, it became clear that giving military gear to cops just meant more local police departments would form SWAT teams—it’s estimated that 80 percent of towns with 25,000 to 50,000 residents now have SWAT teams, up from just 26 percent in 1984—and that they would be more likely to call in the local SWAT team to, say, serve an arrest warrant (never mind that SWAT teams were originally conceived as a special response unit to hostage or active shooter scenarios). The pretense that any of this has anything to do with actual law enforcement has all but disappeared: the federal program doling out the military equipment doesn’t seem to distinguish between areas with high crime rates and those that are relatively safe.

Terrorism Versus Crime

It’s hard to understand this kind of nonchalant police militarization unless you consider that it springs from a specific approach to terrorism and domestic security developed after 9/11 and employed by the last two administrations. Put simply, this approach treats terrorists as criminals and acts of terror as crimes. Law enforcement, not warfare, has become the framework for America’s response to terrorism at home and abroad. Hence, the National Security Agency’s (NSA’s) domestic spying program, the security theater of the Transportation Security Administration, the militarization of local police, and so on.

Fighting terrorism then becomes a matter of law enforcement for the host country but remains, as it should, a matter of diplomacy and warfare for the United States.

It wasn’t always this way. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, our leaders did not contemplate their response as an exercise in law enforcement, or that terrorism was merely a criminal-justice issue. President George W. Bush vowed the United States would “make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them.” Accordingly, the United States delivered an ultimatum to the Taliban: hand over Osama bin Laden or face immediate attack. The Bush administration also gave an ultimatum to Pakistan, which had a long history of accommodating the Taliban. Two days after the attacks, Richard Armitage, the deputy secretary of state, handed Pakistan’s intelligence chief a list of seven demands, which included breaking ties with the Taliban, stopping al-Qaeda operations on the Pakistani border, and granting American forces access to Pakistani bases and airspace. According to former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf, the demands came with a promise that if his country did not comply, the United States would “bomb it back to the Stone Age.”

Here was an entirely different response to terrorism that placed the responsibility for dealing with terrorists on the terror groups’ host regimes: if you do not take care of this problem, we will make war—not only on the terrorists, but also on you, Musharraf, or you, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and topple your regime. According this approach, any leader wishing to preserve his regime is co-opted to fight terrorist groups operating inside his country and dismantle any terrorist networks—even ones the regime itself may have helped establish. Fighting terrorism then becomes a matter of law enforcement for the host country but remains, as it should, a matter of diplomacy and warfare for the United States.

Angelo Codevilla has written at length about this approach to fighting terrorism as the only way to end America’s “permanent war footing” and “restore the respect and geopolitical balance on which peace depends.”

Ending ‘permanent war footing,’ ever so essential for any nation’s sustainability, requires being honest about who threatens us, and putting them out of action while not bothering others. The Bush and Obama Administrations, each for its own reasons, preferred to pretend that our problem consisted of bands of rogues extraneous to any authorities. Both Administrations tried and failed to identify and police such rogues in alien lands while so wrapping America in ‘security measures’ as to make it almost unrecognizable. That way lies permanent war with foreigners and strife amongst ourselves.

Police Abroad, Military At Home

Unfortunately, the Bush administration never really followed through on its promise to hold regimes accountable, or else. Instead, it gradually adopted a law-enforcement strategy for containing al-Qaeda abroad while militarizing law enforcement at home—an approach the Obama administration has maintained.

Holding regimes accountable for terrorism is an infinitely better policy than attempting to police terrorists ourselves because it doesn’t require the creation of a massive security and domestic surveillance apparatus.

But for a democracy, holding regimes accountable for terrorism is an infinitely better policy than attempting to police terrorists ourselves because it doesn’t require the creation of a massive security and domestic surveillance apparatus. The problem with the creation of such an apparatus, designed to disrupt terror plots beforehand and ferret out potential terrorists among us, is that sooner or later it will be turned on the very civilian population it was meant to protect. Between the domestic spying programs of the NSA and the militarization of police departments nationwide, we are now witnessing this process begin to play out here in the United States

If we choose to fight terrorists at home and try to police them abroad, instead of bringing the fight to them and holding their host regimes accountable, we should expect more of the kind of domestic militarization we’ve lately seen in Ferguson. And if the Obama administration’s failure to devise a strategic response to ISIS continues to manifest itself in equivocal and intermittent airstrikes that stop short of destroying the fledgling terrorist state, then we should not be surprised to see boots on the ground—not in Syria or Iraq, but here at home.

How Republicans Like Thom Tillis Should Handle Education Attacks,"GOP Senate challenger Thom Tillis was caught unawares by his opponent, Sen. Kay Hagan’s, attacks against him for not agreeing to spend even more money on schools. Tillis voted for education spending increases at basically the rate of inflation while Hagan appears to be mad he didn’t go on more of a spending binge. But being surprised by this attack doesn’t mean Tillis has to respond by casting himself as the slightly-less-crazy Progressive—which is to say, as the standard Republican—touting his ability to shovel taxpayer money out the door.

Before we get into some figures, let’s look at context. Tillis is the Speaker of the House in North Carolina’s legislature. A lot has been going on in North Carolina lately, and the trends there mimic several nationwide. There’s the effects of the recession, which hit the state hard enough to scare many families. Increasing education spending, even at the rate of inflation (which, by the way, has in the time span been about zero) during the recent recession is more than most states did. In fact, the recession marked the first time in American history that government education spending declined nationwide—albeit slightly.

More context: There’s been an in-state boom in families with children, with families especially seeking the Raleigh and Charlotte areas. And there’s the government debt asteroid hurtling its way towards the state. Lawmakers have enacted some half-measures, which earned enough nationwide establishment scorn to justify a wish they’d done something more serious to actually earn the henpecking. North Carolina has also recently enacted its first school-choice program, a voucher for the poorest of the poor in the state. Nearly twice as many kids tried to get a voucher as managed to secure one this year.

Education Can Be a Reason for Voters to Drop Democrats

As for the Senate race, Hagan had until recently enjoyed a comfortable lead, largely thanks to tarring Tillis with the War on Women brush. But that’s begun to wear off, so she took a look at some numbers showing her greatest need to win among suburbanites and women, and shrewdly pivoted to the kitchen-table issue of education. Education is a sleeper issue in politics that typically resides in the middle of people’s long list of election issues, but since it’s tied both to children and economic prosperity, it’s a huge two-fer when people are nervous (as they obviously are now), especially for women.

There are two smart responses Tillis can make that don’t involve presenting voters with a milder version of a Democrat. These aren’t just for him. Education is becoming an issue that can break off chunks of the Democrat coalition and convert it to Republican voters. Just watch the black civil-rights leaders in Florida, who have slowly begun to make headlines for leaving Democrats because the latter keep backing teachers unions over the state’s massively popular school-choice program, which primarily serves minority and extremely poor families. African-American and Hispanic voters care deeply about their kids and about education, which often substitutes for the strong familial structures their kids, like all kids, desperately need to succeed.

More about school choice and Republicans in a moment. Genuine school choice (not crony capitalism, and not government taking over private schools) is the first winning Republican education policy. The second is taking head-on the assumption that schools need more money.

Most Americans Don’t Know Beans about School Spending

In the past 40 years, North Carolinians have doubled what they spend on K-12 schools, in inflation-adjusted dollars, as Cato’s Andrew Coulson recently showed (he examined the same things for every state, so if you live elsewhere, click through to find the same trend everywhere). Their average SAT scores, however, haven’t budged. That could be something Tillis and other conservative candidates could start educating voters about. For Tillis it may be too late in the game, but other candidates should expect similar attacks and, as we called it in my debate days, “spike” them—always discuss the issue on the campaign trail on offense and defense, rather than waiting until you get attacked to make your defense.

So, what would an education spending campaign “spike” look like? The Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice has been doing polls for years now about public attitudes toward a variety of free-market education policies. Their annual poll of voters nationwide always finds that a minority of voters has any idea what public schools actually spend per student. State-focused polls they conduct regularly show the same. Their 2014 survey found that just 14 percent of Americans could estimate the correct range of per-student spending for K-12 government schools. Two-thirds thought per-pupil spending was $8,000 per child or less (the national average, by the way, is about $12,000) or said they had no idea.

When pollsters split the question and informed half the respondents what education spending is, they saw a nine-point drop in those saying it was “too low,” to 47 percent. The percent of parents of school-age children saying spending is “too low” dropped 20 points if they learned accurate spending figures, to 43 percent. The lack of knowledge and absurdly low estimates endemic nationwide were even more pronounced in North Carolina itself when Friedman did a state-focused poll there in 2012:

only 8% of respondents could estimate the correct per-student spending range for the state (this dollar figure reflects “current expenditures” per student). More than one-fourth of all respondents (26%) thought that less than $4,000 is being spent per student in the state’s public schools. Another 45% of voters said they “don’t know” and did not offer a spending number

So a simple spike would be including the state’s per-pupil spending figure when discussing public education. As the Friedman poll itself shows, that simple information itself lowers people’s expectation that taxpayers should spend more. North Carolinians spend about $8,200 per student, more than twice what most voters who would venture a guess estimated.

A more in-depth spike would educate voters further. They might be enraged to know that North Carolina schools employ almost as many non-teaching staff than teachers. If non-teaching staff had increased at the rate of student enrollment since 1992, teachers could have earned $5,649 more each per year. And, hey, where does that bureaucracy come from, anyway? Well, federal regulations impose millions of compliance man-hours on schools, worth billions in salaries for paper-pushers. While a U.S. Senator has little to do with teacher pay schedules (thank God), he or she can definitely do something about the feds filching money from teacher by forcing schools to hire gobs more non-teaching staff.

Now, Trot Out Some Sad Children and Moms

I hate when people play with others’ emotions while obscuring facts. So I’m not going to advocate that any candidate do it just to get ahead. That would be voter manipulation.





But I do think bad government policies hurt people, and their fellow citizens should know about it so they can flog the people who voted for these harmful policies. Tillis has a record he can cheerfully run on in education, a pro-child, pro-parent record of advocating for the poorest and neediest children in his state to get a good education. I’m talking about his direct and personal advocacy for poor, minority kids to access better schools, just like rich people, by giving them a voucher to the school of their parents’ choice. He even went to bat for these families in the courts.

So Tillis’s ads should look a little less like a white guy doing math at the chalkboard—an activity that gives most Americans instinctive shivers—and a little more like this.



Thom Tillis fought for families like these. And, in great part due to his leadership, some 2,000 desperate North Carolina kids are in better schools today. He can certainly tell that story, pointing out also that Hagan opposes parent choice, and he should, especially if he needs to win the mom and suburban voters in the middle (he does). The sort of people who like math are probably already on Tillis’s side. It’s time to go after people who go soft when they see a mother crying—and isn’t that everybody, anyway?

Tillis has been talking up vouchers on the campaign trail, and that’s good, but even more powerful are having other people speaking out for him, especially people who break the meme that Republicans are only for the rich and well-connected. A YouTube search of his name and the word “education,” for example, pulls up a string of short videos from Hagan’s camp, largely interviews with teachers angry at Tillis. Some twenty videos down is Tillis’s math video. For Pete’s sake, at least Tillis’s own campaign should have a monopoly on searches of his name on YouTube. This is elementary branding. It’s impossible to talk to people if they can’t first find you.

School Choice, Jobs Get Voters’ Attention

I talked with a single mom in North Carolina few weeks ago, before the state Supreme Court again allowed the voucher program to continue while a union lawsuit against it works its way through the courts. She talked with me for nearly an hour. Poor parents whose kids get vouchers will do that, by the way. Talk a total stranger’s ear off about their dreams for their child, and how a voucher is their golden ticket. Perhaps a few politicians should try it.

Kena Cooper’s third and last child is 13 years old. Last year, Keenan would sit silently in the car beside her on the way home from school, trying not to cry about the bullies who choked and punched him. Once, when she went to pick up Keenan from public school for a dentist’s appointment, Kena glanced through the window into the cafeteria and saw kids running around and fighting. And it wasn’t just the chaos. It was the education.

When Keenan had difficulties in two classes, “I met with the principal and the guidance counselor as well as the superintendent three times, twice for the superintendent,” Kena said. “I told them, ‘I want him held back. He’s not getting what he needs.’ Their argument was, ‘All his friends are going to the next grade.’ Do you think I care all his friends are going to the next grade? I need him able to do the work.” The school administrators worried Keenan would be taller compared to his classmates if they held him back: “You keep telling me about the physical things, but in his mind, he’s not getting it,” she said, her soft voice rising in pitch. “And you’re telling me about his height? You guys really got degrees?”

When she got Keenan into a private school thanks to his voucher, they found the seventh grader reading and doing math at about a third-grade level. His public school had put his math and reading ability at an eighth-grade level. As for what they teach, Kena is no fool. She knows when instruction is weak: “It’s time for people to stop being lethargic that are in these offices and districts. You’re not teaching cursive writing any more? Why not? You’re not teaching English, it’s just language arts? You’re not teaching verbs and nouns any more, and breaking it down? There’s no need for multiplication tables any more? My dad gave me the speech on that: if you’re at a cash register and your register breaks down, are you going to stand there and stare at them? That’s making kids lazy. They need to keep their mind active on things that are important and necessary. The priorities are all jacked up, oh my goodness.”

Kena is now dead-set on keeping Keenan in his new school, no matter what it takes, after his reaction upon coming home from a welcome-to-school rollerskating and slumber party.

“He called me from the rollerskating rink. When I answered, he said, ‘I’m having the time of my teenage life,’ in his scratchy soprano—he’s hitting puberty,” she said, with a grin in her voice. She waved her daughter over and they listened to Keenan’s exuberance together. He asked his mom to bring his sleeping bag, and after he got some sleep the next day, Kena went and sat on his bed.

“I said, ‘So, what do you think?’ He said, ‘They like me, and I like them too.’ They like me. He was so happy that they liked him.” At his new school, students pass quietly in the hallways, and classes average eight students per teacher.

Kena says she makes less than $20,000 a year at a local radio station. There, “I sit back and listen. I hear Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity, it’s more instigating-type media. If they could just look at situations like this, when it’s for the kids, that would be a better investment of time, than raring against the Democrats, the president. It’s entertainment, but what’s really needed is bringing things like this to the light.”

Kena also worries about her oldest child, a 22-year-old young African-American man with no criminal record and no kids, “no strikes against him,” but who can’t find a job. Like many North Carolinians, the job market is very personal to both her and people she loves dearly.

“I am a low-income worker right now, but I work,” she says, pointedly. “I am not on the system at all. My income is not up like everybody else’s, that doesn’t mean that I don’t pay taxes, I do. So when you’re talking about taxpayers’ money, you’re talking about me.” It irks her when people complain that the voucher program uses tax dollars. The point of tax dollars is to benefit taxpayers, and that includes her, on behalf of her child.

“Government has done so many projects that have wasted so much money, but this is our children,” she says, earnestly. “Solar panels or growing crops are one thing. So many test-tube projects the government is saying, ‘Let’s try it, let’s throw money out there.’ But these are real kids, so why are you fighting against the kids?”

Malevolent Billionaire Announces Voter Suppression Scheme,"San Francisco offshore hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer is the biggest donor in American politics by a country mile. As of the most recent round of disclosures, he had contributed $42,725,000 to elect Democrats, which is more than the top 31 Republican donors—combined. So of course when the Arlington-based liberal blog Politico obtained a Steyer strategy memo last month, they headlined their story “Memo: Value in anti-Koch attacks” and completely ignored the shocking voter suppression strategy advocated by Steyer’s top political hand, Chris Lehane.

Here’s the key part from page eight of the Steyer memo:

He goes on to identify specific smears and attacks designed to demoralize Republicans and suppress their turnout in those “Republican Haircut Programs.”

Remarkably, the smears mostly consist of falsely accusing Republicans of being beholden to billionaire donors—even though this strategy would be executed by the biggest donor in American politics, on behalf of candidates who actually did corruptly promise Steyer they would help kill the Keystone XL pipeline and tens of thousands of jobs in exchange for his millions.

The hypocrisy gets worse. For instance, regarding Iowa, the Steyer memo says:

Of course, that vicious smear is so false that even the liberals at Politifact gave it a full false. But it is also being fully financed by hypocrite Steyer—who made his entire fortune running offshore hedge funds in the Cayman Islands, Singapore, and Mauritius that he advertised to investors as a tax avoidance scheme. And Iowa Senate candidate Bruce Braley, Joni Ernst’s opposition, actually reversed his previous support for Keystone to get the Steyer money flowing, so he really is beholden to an out-of-state billionaire based on a corrupt deal.

All of this while Democrats and their media allies are pretending that Republicans—who are at an enormous overall cash disadvantage—are the ones benefiting from an imagined flood of outside money.

Liberal groups MoveOn.org and MayDay (a Super PAC funded largely Sean Parker, the Facebook billionaire portrayed by Justin Timberlake in “The Social Network”) even have a video contest about the evils of big money in politics. To test their sincerity, my organization has entered the contest (vote here!) with an ad about Steyer. We’re leading the public voting, but I suspect they’ll come up with a reason to not declare us the winner.

Back to the memo:

Just imagine for a moment the wailing and gnashing of teeth if a memo from a billionaire conservative donor announced a “Democrat Haircut Strategy” to use smears and false attacks to depress Democratic turnout. The Steyer strategy is just that: use his billions to muddy the waters with vicious, unsubstantiated attacks in the hopes of depressing Republican turnout. And Politico had this story a month ago, but wrote another article attacking the Kochs instead.",https://thefederalist.com/2014/10/15/malevolent-billionaire-announces-voter-suppression-scheme/,2014-10-15
What Are The GOP’S Options In The 2016 Presidential Campaign Now?,"Awake, tired politicos, rub your eyes, and grab a large cup of coffee. 2014 is over. Even with the Louisiana race still technically undecided, it ended last night. Today the other “it” begins… it is the first day of the 2016 presidential campaign.

Now begins roughly a year, perhaps a year and a half, of insane speculation, horserace over-analyzing, moment-by-moment focus on the latest gaffes, endorsements, fundraising numbers, clever and stupid social media ploys, debate wins and losses. In a couple of months, you will already be sick of it and desperately want it to end.

But it is beginning, and as the Republican party, its grassroots, its donors, even its occasional voters turn their eyes to the race, it is a good time to take a snapshot of where each prospective candidate stands: Assets, liabilities, and inexplicable oddities. Off to the races we go.

Jeb Bush

Let’s just kill all excitement right upfront and state that Jeb Bush will not run for president.

There are numerous reasons for this. For starters, being president is a pretty sucky job, actually, as is running for president, and both are certainly monster-sucky jobs compared to the things Jeb does now. But perhaps more importantly, when literally everyone in your family has run for president, and you’re in the younger generation, yet another elder Bush running for president slightly risks poisoning the well, something Jeb is sensitive to.

There is also plenty of evidence to back up the conclusion that Jeb wants to look like he might run for president and scare the crap out of the entire rest of the prospective field and make them listen to what he’s got to say and heed his advice and instincts on things like education and immigration and the importance of executive leadership. However, looking like you’re running is not the same as running, and people close to Jeb know it. Jebites who would—if Jeb were seriously considering running—be staying away from other candidates like the plague are engaging in a lot of candidate dating. In fact, some of them have even already put a proverbial ring on it.

Jeb will not run, unless no one in the field can speak to his issues on even some vaguely acceptable level and unless no governors with a strong track record of leadership jump in. The odds of both of those things failing to occur are slim at best. The prospective field is actually pretty free market and anti-restrictionist when it comes to immigration; it includes people who have focused on education in a serious way; and some strong executive types appear likely to run.

Ergo, no Jeb. This would be sad for political reporters if indeed it were acknowledged, but of course it won’t be. Expect the Jeb buzz to continue. Expect him to never emerge as a candidate unless something seriously, seriously weird and currently completely unforeseen happens.

Chris Christie

Chris Christie is, not surprisingly, very likely to run.

On the plus side of the ledger, Christie gets stuff done and takes no prisoners. He does what a governor is supposed to do, and what a president fundamentally is responsible for: He executes. This is a lot of the reason big donors love Christie. That gives him a big starting advantage: Money. Money with which to hire the best staff. Money with which to build out the best technology infrastructure. Money, money, money.

There is also an element of the famed John McCain “straight talking” to Christie, though with no dark sense of humor infiltrating his comments. A lot of voters, and not just (or even mainly) Republicans, like this. It reads as no-nonsense, and certainly will help keep Christie out of the inauthenticity hole Mitt Romney fell into so regularly.

However, there is a flip side to this, also. A recent Buzzfeed piece about Christie on the 2014 campaign trail was categorized under the tag of “yelling,” and that is a pretty accurate reflection of what most people perceive him as doing, always. There’s a fine line between a guy who can be a dick and get stuff done and a guy who’s just a bully. Christie needs to stay on the right side of that line, and it won’t be easy with the media up in his face.

Christie could be forgiven for thinking this will be easy to handle, since he’s operated in the toughest media market in the country throughout his time as governor, and went through a proverbial crapstorm where the Bridgegate scandal was concerned. But the reality is—and any seasoned communications operative who has worked presidential campaigns will tell you this—what Christie has experienced to date is nothing compared to what will hit him the second he steps into this arena. It is not clear that he or his current team is prepared for it. Given Christie’s propensity for engaging in screaming matches with liberals and hecklers and other irritants, it is also frankly not clear that Christie’s vocal chords are ready for this.

Christie needs to have a game plan for appropriately managing what will be vastly heightened scrutiny from hostile forces, including members of the media and of his own party who think he’s way too far to the Left on everything from guns to taxes to abortion (even if this latter assertion is dubious ) and even those who resent the comments he made in defense of Romneycare in 2012.

Christie also needs to have a game plan with regard to balancing out the basic energy requirements of retail politicking on the trail, dialing for dollars, and doing everything else a candidate must do. Christie is to be commended on his weight loss, but put it this way: I am a relatively energetic, slim woman and there is no way in hell that I could cope with the day-to-day schedule of a presidential candidate attempting to compete in either Iowa or New Hampshire. This is going to be a challenge for Christie, like it or not.

Ted Cruz

Here’s your other big let-down: I think it highly unlikely Ted Cruz will run for president.

Pick your jaw up off the floor and consider this: Right now, Ted Cruz has life just about as sweet as it can be, if you’re a politician. And in January, it’s only going to get better. Intra-party strife will increase, but Republicans will actually be dictating the agenda in both houses of Congress. More focus will be placed on the question of what is the heart and soul of the Republican Party as the race for president gets underway. Cruz is going to be in high demand as all of this plays out. Just look at all the 2014 candidates who wanted him by their side.

Even as it stands today, Cruz is the rock star of the party. The guy who is lauded by the grassroots all day, every day, for his efforts to defund Obamacare, slash spending, or go after Obama on really any issue that is hot and topical. By maintaining that position, he already gets to do all the fun things that a presidential candidate does: Give speeches, go on TV, blast Democrats, blast RINOS, focus on specific areas of interest in the Senate, ratchet up all kinds of wins there. He also has to do none of the things that are tedious and annoying: Calling donors, spending months out on the road eating terrible food and being frozen cold while working to win the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary.

Cruz has it absolutely great right now. If he runs for president, there’s a significant risk that he jeopardizes all of that in what would be a pretty big gamble (because running for president always is) that entails no additional fun and a lot of additional drudgery. Unless he really, really, really just wants to be president (and he seems to really, really, really love being who he is right now), this just doesn’t seem like a logical move.

One caveat is that one does occasionally hear grumbling from people who are “kind of a big deal” in Texas about how Cruz is really representing himself more than the state, how he’s lost popularity there since being elected, and so on and so forth. If this is real, and Cruz is seeing it in his polling, and if he is also seeing in presidential polling an opening where he could do well, he might then consider running because if it’s giving a presidential run a shot and opening up some new horizons, or sticking around ready to slog it out in 2018 when people he needs to perform well in a re-election campaign just can’t be bothered with him, well, then he might go the presidential route. But this seems unlikely as it stands. Thus, the safer bet is, no Ted Cruz candidacy, just rumors and anticipation.

Carly Fiorina

This is one of the lesser-discussed possibilities out there, but I include it because I get a lot of questions about it.

Carly Fiorina was widely rumored to be in the running for the vice presidential nomination spot in 2008. While she lost her 2010 Senate run in California, she outperformed the much more moderate, much better funded Meg Whitman and beat the voter registration gap in the state. She is generally considered to be one of the most deft destroyers of Democratic narratives and talking points where Sunday political shows and other on-the-spot, high-visibility environments are concerned. And the launch of her UP Project and its activity in places like New Hampshire has generated a lot of chatter about what exactly she is up to and whether she might run for president (as have her answers to questions about exactly that).

It is not clear at this stage exactly what Carly is up to, but assuming she could at least be toying with the idea of running, it’s worth noting a few assets and liabilities.

First, in the plus column, Carly is an excellent communicator, and a fierce and effective attack dog. She is also smart and knowledgeable, and in a range of areas that go well beyond business and technology. She is strong in debates, and it’s easy to imagine her going head-to-head with Hillary Clinton and performing well. She would likely run a more tech-savvy campaign than many other prospective candidates, which matters because even if Republicans come on leaps and bounds from our present circumstances, we still lag behind Democrats and this will be a significant disadvantage in 2016. Carly also probably has better data on what works with women, and what does not, than other prospective candidates, and that will matter if we are running against Hillary Clinton or indeed Democrat veterans who know how to widen the gender gap and kill Republicans off with it. Perhaps most of all, Carly has shown she is willing to do deeply unpopular things that she believes are right and never waver in the face of extreme, harsh criticism. This matters as a leadership quality. It is also something that conservatives wish they would see more of in conservative candidates, and Carly is, as it happens, quite a bit more conservative than most people would guess.

By the same token, however, Carly’s willingness to persevere with an unpopular strategy where she believes in it and take a pounding if needs be is also the root of much criticism of her time in business, and that would be a recurrent theme in attacks against her. Mitigating that on a national scale would be much tougher than doing so in even a big state; as we saw in 2012, attacks on candidates’ business records play very differently in states like Ohio than many candidates expect. That is something that GOP primary voters are more attuned to now than they were as the 2012 cycle got underway.

Carly would also face the challenge of having very minimal name ID outside business circles compared to someone like Christie, Paul, or Walker. That means a lot of time on the trail or a lot of money to spend to get on people’s radars. Carly could self-fund to a point, but not to the point that most people would assume. It is also a fallacy to assume that as a woman, she would automatically prove more attractive or appealing to women than all the male candidates, though as seen in her California race, a lot of male voters do rally to strong women.

Finally, with any candidate whose background is more in business than in politics, there is a risk she will prove too businesslike as a candidate. What does this mean? Voters claim to want straight shooters, who will speak the truth even if it is controversial. The reality is that these traits are actually more favored by the Securities Exchange Commission, shareholders, and investors. Voters don’t always want to hear the truth on contentious or controversial topics like abortion, globalization, free trade, tax reform, education, job training, immigration, or—perhaps most of all— entitlements. They want to hear things that validate their views and make them feel good, even if it means a candidate spouting total nonsense. Candidates with business backgrounds frequently get into trouble because they don’t tell voters what they want to hear nearly enough, and they can be too focused on “doing” and not enough on “saying.” Carly has more experience in the political realm than your average business candidate, but this remains one reason why career politicians often trump candidates with a private sector background in tough races. And of course, running for president of the United States is the toughest race on the planet.

Mike Huckabee

Mike Huckabee will not run for president. Huck already has the ability to influence the party and force members of it to speak to his constituency’s concerns (does anyone really think that Rick Santorum or a similar candidate will not hew the line that Huckabee’s voters expect to hear on gay marriage or abortion?).

He also has the ability to do so while not having to slog it out every day on the campaign trail, deal with attacks on himself and his record (which he handled more testily than most candidates during 2008), and make a lot more money by staying out of the race. For a guy with Huckabee’s background, that is not to be underestimated.

Also, remember that with the expectation that Hillary will run, there are a lot of reporters and researchers spending a lot of time in Arkansas digging up dirt. A lot of what they find will be Hillary-related. But some of it would probably be Huckabee-related, too, and any (further) ethics problems that emerge would tarnish his political, media and business brand.

Running for president just isn’t good business for Huckabee at this point.

Bobby Jindal

Bobby Jindal is the candidate who has recently most signaled his presidential ambitions, grabbing conservative media attention for everything from his proposed defense policy to his views on Duck Dynasty. He is already working very hard at running for president and getting some attention, mostly from more elite, intellectual conservatives who want a nominee that is smart as a whip, above all else.

That is Jindal’s big strength. With the arguable exception of Rob Portman, he is probably smarter than anyone else who will run for president in 2016 by a large margin (even if he tries to play folksy and average with some of his cultural commentary, the guy is a Rhodes scholar and don’t you forget it). With the country facing a lot of big challenges, which may need to be addressed by someone with a particularly big brain, he will generate more interest than a lot of observers might predict. He also ticks the social conservative box nicely, which will matter to a lot of voters, and he is not an old white guy.

How advantageous this last point would be in a general election, in practice, is an open question, but the fact is, a lot of Republican voters are tired of being labeled as racists and supporting someone who doesn’t fit the stereotypical Republican mold (on numerous counts) can be a big draw for conservatives particularly irked by the racism charge. That they’d be able to tick this box while also supporting a very conservative guy who happens to be much smarter than your average bear is even better.

On the down side, however, Jindal is perceived as overly bland and boring, perhaps too Mr. Rogers-like by a lot of voters still, and he will have to work to overcome those preconceived notions. It will probably be better for him to address this hurdle by emphasizing his smarts, though he does display an interest in attempting to rectify the problem by engaging in cultural commentary that strikes some people as goofy and utterly inauthentic. There are a lot of people who would prefer to think of Bobby Jindal as reading the Economist for fun (as he probably does), rather than devotedly tuning into Duck Dynasty (does he really?).

Jindal also remains little-known, and will have to spend a lot of time, energy and money getting known by primary voters. He simply lacks the public profile of a Christie, Perry, Paul, or Walker.

John Kasich

Kasich is another figure who has been vigorously signaling his intention to run for president of late. This has a lot of conservatives downright confused, as they do not understand where a guy who expanded Medicaid and defended it, and has pissed off some vocal conservatives in his state royally, gets votes from more-conservative-than-your-average-voter primary voters. To this, Kasich fans offer rejoinders involving his pro-life stance and policies (things that do still matter a great deal to a lot of folks in the grassroots, to be fair).

By various accounts, Kasich does not seem to care about the rifts with conservatives in his home state, or what people think about his Medicaid expansion. His bet seems to be that voters will be interested in an executive with a business background and strong views on budgetary matters who won re-election in the most hotly-contested state in the country in a landslide. That seems like an argument that will be more persuasive with donors than voters. But if he has the cash, the voters may come in due course.

One less-discussed factor is the impact that Kasich’s former career at Lehman Brothers could potentially have. This was a line of attack that various Ohio politicos and observers feel was actually leveraged less than they expected in 2010, but it seems likely that in a packed GOP primary field, it could be raised more vigorously. Again, after the experience of 2012, Republican voters may be gun-shy about supporting a candidate who is potentially very prone to having his business record attacked. They know how effective such attacks were against Romney, and Lehman is a better-known name than Bain was at the outset of that campaign.

Rand Paul

Depending on your brand of conservatism, your views on the importance of outreach to non-traditional GOP voters, and your level of tolerance for fiery rhetoric and a lot of Republican self-flagellation, you either love Rand Paul or hate him. Very few politically-tuned-in Americans, and even fewer Republicans, have no opinion of him or a neutral or mild opinion of him.

In the “love” camp are libertarians, a lot of self-described Tea Partiers, Republicans who believe the party needs to do vastly more to engage minority voters including shifting away from policies many minorities view as problematic, Silicon Valley Republicans, younger voters, and a lot of people who wouldn’t normally vote in Republican primaries (note that these categories also overlap). This makes technology and the digital aspect of campaigning potential real strengths that Paul will have over other candidates (he has access to a pool of talent that other candidates will not). It also creates an imperative for him to do much, much more in terms of leveraging that technology to organize and turn out his voters, because a large segment of potential Paul supporters are not people who would definitely participate in caucuses or vote in primaries absent significant, concerted pushing from the campaign. Paul is interesting to, and has the provisional backing of, a surprisingly large number of big GOP donors, as well as a bevy of potential small-dollar donors. Paul ultimately has the potential to be something close to the Republican equivalent of 2008 Democratic candidate Barack Obama (insofar as the primary race is concerned), if he plays his cards right, runs a tight ship, and exploits bipartisan concerns surrounding civil liberties issues (which could be heightened with a prospective Hillary Clinton presidency). Remember all the chatter about Obamacans, and Independents and Democrats who couldn’t get on board with Hillary in 2008 because of her votes on the Iraq War and her perceived hawkishness in general (with implications for things like surveillance policy)? They still exist, and they also exist in reverse. Call them the Paulocrats, and Independents and Republicans who feel that a shift to a more isolationist yet realist foreign policy might be smart.

On the other side of the coin, however, there are a lot of people who don’t like Paul, and some significant liabilities he will need to deal with. Neoconservatives, foreign policy hawks, and strongly pro-Israel (but non-evangelical) voters generally hate and fear him for deep, philosophical reasons. Some social conservatives think he’s a bit too soft for their taste. Some more mainstream Republicans worry about his positions, which to them read as rather extreme (even if many Americans might objectively disagree) and foresee an easy Hillary Clinton win if Paul is nominated. Others fret about the potential for some more fringe characters in the libertarian-conservative movement to torpedo his campaign. Concerns on the latter two fronts may prove to be unfounded, but Paul will need a plan to ensure that it is so.

Perhaps more than any other prospective candidate, the media likes to go after Paul and it would be easy for him and his team to conclude that because of this, they’re better prepared to handle a very hostile press corps than any other candidate. It would be a mistake for them to assume this, however, and be complacent about it. Paul represents a significant threat to a lot of powerful interests, and a lot of Democratic Party and liberal organizations especially hate him because he is attractive to certain segments of the Democratic base and is making a serious effort at engaging voters that Democrats consider exclusively theirs and view almost as political demographics to which they are entitled. This would include, for example, minority groups, and most especially African-Americans.

Paul is a threat to such interests, which could make him far more viable than expected, or alternately cause the ruin of his campaign. What is clear is that Paul has a very different set of assets and liabilities to other likely candidates, and may wind up being the most interesting candidate to watch, whether you love him or hate him.

Rick Perry

When the words “Rick Perry” and “presidential candidate” are mentioned in tandem, two things tend to happen. First, people trot out “1, 2, 3” and “oops” jokes. Second, people laugh as if you are the world’s best comedian. But a second Rick Perry candidacy, while not a dead cert, is also not a joke—and perhaps ought not be treated as one.

Everyone knows the knocks on Perry. He is not generally considered to be an epic brainbox, and his 2012 campaign convinced a lot of people that he is dimmer, more gaffe-prone and generally unreliable and incapable as a candidate than he really is. He also has some positions that read as pretty extreme and scary to a lot of mainstream Republicans (recall his views on Social Security, and he is an unabashed social conservative).

But Perry knows how to run a big state, get stuff done, and deal with difficult problems. He is a conservative who has been capable of attracting Hispanic support. He has a solid economic record. People who love him really, really love him (there’s very little lukewarm sentiment about Perry). He is telegenic (yes, this matters). And there are two other major assets Perry has that people too frequently overlook.

First, he is one of two likely contenders who has actually run for president before, and therefore knows just how hard and horrific a presidential campaign really is (the others are just conjecturing right now, and probably underestimating the sheer hell that awaits them, because all first-time candidates do). This enables Perry to better understand what giving 100 percent of his energy and effort really means, and then to prepare to give more than that (whether or not he actually does).

Second, Perry generally has a reputation for being incredibly dangerous when he’s down and discounted. He likes being the underdog, as opposed to being the frontrunner. Right now, the bar couldn’t really be set any lower for Perry where expectations are concerned. Nearly everyone thinks—unfairly, in my view—that he is a blundering dolt who can barely get his name right in a debate. Those expectations will be insanely easy to beat, and if and when Perry does run and begins exceeding them and starts riling up crowds and killing it where retail politics is concerned, he will look much more threatening.

Perry should not be discounted, even though he might best be described as a wild card at this stage.

Rob Portman

Rob Portman is the preferred candidate of a lot of people who matter in the context of a packed GOP primary: More socially moderate voters, who need a candidate to flock to; Republicans looking for someone fundamentally smart and competent and no-frills who can deliver if not excite in debates; DC establishment types who could almost go for Chris Christie but aren’t wild about the yelling; and potentially younger voters who might be sour on Democratic economic policies but also cannot stomach voting for a candidate with whom they disagree on gay marriage (a small, but potentially quite expandable, pool). Portman will interest a lot of bigger donors, and when Jeb fails to enter the race, there will be Bushie types who naturally flock to him. He also could be interesting in a state like New Hampshire, which he knows well having attended Dartmouth and having a child who currently studies there.

On the flip side, Portman might possibly read as even less interesting to your average grassroots activist than Tim Pawlenty when not making out-of-left-field jokes or calling President Obama a doofus. He is not a terribly exciting public speaker (though he is reportedly much better at retail politics, which matters greatly in Iowa and New Hampshire). And social moderates are not a big constituency within the GOP primary voter pool, so while he might be able to start off in a decent position, his ability to hold it is very dependent on other candidates in the race. Portman will also probably be attacked for having served in the Bush administration; it remains to be seen how that will be viewed in 2016.

Mitt Romney

Mitt Romney will not run in 2016. Yes, yes, there are lots of Romney loyalists—the kind of people who routinely remark about him being such a fundamentally good man—who want him to run, and will not even look at other prospective candidates until he has had “I Will Not Run In 2016” tattooed across his forehead.

But irrespective, Romney will not run. He got dusted in 2012, an election that should have been winnable by a Republican, and is frankly just too disliked by too many people in the party to give this a third go-around. People want a fresh face, not a two-time loser. And, undoubtedly, Ann Romney would like to spend more time with her husband and not watch him be savaged by the media, Democrats, and his party for yet another time.

Marco Rubio

Marco Rubio’s name has been mentioned less of late as that of a viable prospective presidential candidate, but make no mistake: A lot of big donors still like him, and he is still attractive to a lot of people in the party. The conventional wisdom is that he damaged his brand and his standing by pursuing immigration reform. But a look at GOP presidential nominating history indicates that support for comprehensive immigration reform ultimately helps win nominations, not lose them (Seriously: Go look at how McCain won the nomination; it’s called “Florida” and support for immigration reform ultimately helps, not hurts, there).

Rubio does appear to have faltered a bit more than was optimal and overcorrected when he started taking incoming fire over his support for comprehensive immigration reform. A lot of people view his switch after championing the Gang of Eight bill to talking up his pro-life credentials and opposition to Common Core as rather obvious and craven. But this is at least partially unfair: Rubio is rather socially conservative, and could reasonably have been expected to talk about life issues as a senator, with or without immigration reform having been within his purview.

The real challenges for Rubio are not voter concern about immigration, or his response to being taken to the woodshed by a lot of immigration restrictionists after pushing for the bill. Rather, they are to do with the underlying sense a good chunk of Republicans have that the country has not prospered under a relatively young, inexperienced, charismatic, good-speechmaker with an inspiring personal story involving achieving the American Dream after being born to a foreign parent, and worries that merely switching the philosophy and party label of said individual wouldn’t dramatically improve the outcome. Furthermore, some Republicans say that Rubio may be less enthusiastic about traveling and being away from Florida than other candidates. If that proves to be true, it will be a big problem.

Of course, Rubio could choose to simply run for re-election in 2016. Or he could think of running for governor in 2018—if he wants to spend more time at home, the latter option might appeal more than running for president.

Rick Santorum

Rick Santorum will probably run for president. He is not otherwise engaged in pursuits that would keep him out of the race. In the absence of a Santorum run, there is no candidate who can or will speak as aggressively and passionately to his voters’ concerns (primarily social issues), and that would be an intolerable situation for him.

Like Perry, Santorum has run before, which may give him a more realistic view of what the race will entail. That said, Santorum has never seemed particularly inclined to take certain steps that would undoubtedly help him win elections, even when he knows full well what those steps are. As a 2016 candidate, he would very likely continue his pattern of focusing extensively on social issues, on which he is very conservative and about which he can sound extremely preachy, negative, and indeed angry. In the absence of a Romney-type candidate, his ability to engage in blue-collar versus white-collar, wealthy versus working-class fights and have that prove politically expedient would be much diminished.

All this being said, he still has a base in Iowa that is leverageable and the ability to force other candidates to talk about his issues, which oftentimes gets them into trouble without adversely affecting him.

Scott Walker

It is not clear yet whether Scott Walker really wants to run for president. However, if he makes this decision shortly, he could be a formidable candidate.

Walker is adored by many in the GOP base, and that adoration cuts across intra-party divides. A lot of libertarians love him. A lot of mainstream and moderate Republicans love him. A lot of neoconservatives and hawks love him. About the only people who worry deeply about a Walker nomination are people who know there is a hard ceiling on his potential levels of support in a general election, because he is so hated by Democrats and unions.

Make no mistake, those on the left of American politics would go all-out to stop a Walker presidency in a way they probably would not were any other candidate nominated. That said, Walker has already had to contend with this reality a few times in a state that leans blue, and he has prevailed due to a combination of hard work, avoiding procrastination, taking his beatings upfront, and always assuming the very, very worst, preparing for it, and then hoping for the best. Unlike a lot of candidates, Walker is a hard worker and an over-deliverer.

Some Republicans worry that a Clinton-Walker contest would look like a grievous mismatch between someone with boatloads of experience and credibility and someone with relatively little of both. To the extent that Walker looked inexperienced and lacking in credibility two weeks ago, though, that is a perception that may already be changing among some critics.

Others worry that Walker is too boring—another Pawlenty, they say. That charge mostly seems to come from people who haven’t seen Walker up close and personal or at his very best (very often when his family is close by, something he would be well-advised to ensure is a point covered off at most campaign events should he run). Walker is very different to Pawlenty, in some ways good (a more charismatic speaker), and in some ways bad (a far less-built out national political organization).

The latter is probably one of the two biggest challenges facing Walker—his operation is extremely Wisconsin-centric, and he will need to staff up, staff well, and staff fast in order to position himself to run and win.

The other big challenges facing Walker is the same as that about to be confronted by other candidates: He is another Republican who has been subjected to harsh scrutiny by the media and therefore may be under the misapprehension that he and his team are ready to deal with the spotlight that comes with running for president. Like all of them, except for those who have run before or been in a similarly-scrutinized position (Fiorina, as CEO of Hewlett Packard), if he thinks he’s ready to deal with the hell that may be about to ensue, he will be proved wrong.

So, Off to the Presidential Horseraces

Which of these candidates will in fact enter the fray? Who will be the 2016 nominee? There are simply too many factors in play right now to even guess at an answer. But make no mistake, the potential 2016 field is probably the most philosophically, ethnically, background and gender-diverse that we’ve seen in years. It is also probably the most intriguing and appealing to voters within the party and outside it. Watch closely. It will be an exciting race.

The Nation Needs President Scott Walker In 2016,"On election night, as the excitement of the event crescendoed, Heather Wilhelm made an observation. Not all were swayed.

Don’t Immanentize the Eschaton

Charles Cooke, writing in National Review, warns of the folly of looking for a conservative savior. His advice is prudent. We’re conservatives, dammit, and we don’t need an earthly savior. But the siren song of a conservative who can actually speak English and woo voters is just so enticing.

As a rule, we on the right like to tell ourselves that we are steadfastly opposed to heroes in politics, and that we are especially opposed to heroes who promise that their election to the executive branch will result in sweeping changes or in a post-partisan utopia. The United States, we argue, was set up in opposition to princes and to aristocrats, with the express recognition that politics will always be with us and with the explicit understanding that the influence of individual players would be strictly limited by the system.

Has Walker promised sweeping changes and a utopia? Not exactly. But conservatives, let’s admit it, are prone to seeking the next Reagan, the savior who will rebuild a shining city on the hill and make conservatism anew. We shouldn’t do that. Even as it helps to have a candidate who can articulate a positive vision for the future, we shouldn’t forget that the plate has to have a steak on it in order to have sizzle.

The Throne Made of the Skulls of His Enemies

Does Walker sizzle? Not exactly. Is he a particularly charismatic speaker? No, he isn’t. But does he sit upon a throne made of the skulls of his enemies? Yes, yes he does. The November 4 election proved that in a definitive fashion. And though we are a constitutional republic not given to men upon thrones, this particular throne deserves consideration for a national position. And, despite Joy’s argument to the contrary, we will never go wrong with Cool Cal.

The people cannot look to legislation generally for success. Industry, thrift, character, are not conferred by act or resolve. Government cannot relieve from toil. It can provide no substitute for the rewards of service. It can, of course, care for the defective and recognize distinguished merit. The normal must care for themselves. Self-government means self-support.

Exactly. In 2016, the goal is subtraction, of untangling the Byzantine layers upon Byzantine layers wrapped around a gooey center of rancid nougat. If there is one thing all but the most stubborn of Progressives have learned, it is that legislation generally does a craptastic job when it comes to offering us individual success. Instead, it hamstrings us. Taxes us excessively. Makes l-i-v-i-n’ more expensive. No one is arguing that we should throw granny off a cliff—skipping right past a Hillary joke here—but we do need to take a step back, strip layers from the labyrinth, and focus on the economy, not because we wish to save money, but people.

A Message That Resonates?

One can argue that nominating a modern-day Coolidge on the heels of the Great Recession and to follow a man who was initially thought of as a dynamic, charismatic speaker would be an idiotic idea. But it’s time for Republicans to get idiotic. To do the opposite of everything our guts are telling us. It’s time to embrace our inner George Costanza.

In 2008, we went with the cranky, possibly crazy, curmudgeon known as John McCain. We probably should have gone with Mitt Romney. In 2012, we went with Romney. His promise of competent, effective management coupled with all the excitement of Walker plus a side of toast was not well received. We probably should’ve gone with a sleeveless Rick Perry. With those facts in mind, in 2016, we should definitely go for a candidate with more charisma, right? Not so fast.

Scott Walker keeps getting elected in a state given to Prairie Populism, despite the fact that, like Coolidge, he tends to think citizens should be given to self-support.

Look at Walker’s results. He slashed money from a bloated education budget. He dismantled collective bargaining rights for public employees. He reduced Medicaid spending. And he keeps getting elected in a state given to Prairie Populism, despite the fact that, like Coolidge, he tends to think citizens should be given to self-support.

But what does he offer our collective imagination? What does he do to inspire us to rally around a cause? What are you, a raging lefty? You’re missing the point. Walker doesn’t offer us anything, and we should be cool with that. It’s what we cynical GenXers have been working for—getting the government off our damn lawn.

As for the Millennials, they’ll get on board once they learn about things like “jobs” and “money” and “not living in the basement.” What does Walker’s tenure look like with regard to those? Well, despite his obvious hatred for most living humans, pretty damn good. Unemployment in Wisconsin has been consistently below the national average during his tenure. But what about education? Surely performance suffered with the death blows Walker dealt to the unions and education spending. Oof, wrong again. So though the man himself doesn’t sizzle, his record does. And as conservatives, we should celebrate that. We should also acknowledge Walker can capably discuss those accomplishments even if he doesn’t exactly sizzle in the process.

Act 10’s collective-bargaining reforms allowed the state to balance the budget, and counties to restrain or even reduce the property taxes that had increased 27% over the decade before Mr. Walker. But the legislation also improved Wisconsin in ways that ‘wouldn’t seem quite as obvious,’ he says. By eliminating tenure and seniority work rules, ‘we can hire and fire based on merit and pay based on performance, we can put the best and brightest in our classrooms—and voilà, graduation rates are up. ACT scores are up, now second best in the country. Third-grade reading scores are up. The left certainly doesn’t acknowledge this: Our schools are better.’

But Hillary is Formidable

As a native resident of Arkansas, I am well aware of the danger in underestimating the Clinton Machine. Nevertheless, I will wager dollars to donuts that Hillary Clinton will not be the nominee in 2016. Part of it is the Democratic tendency for “squirrel!,” but there is also the hard truth that the 2014 election was especially not good for Hillary.

Hillary Clinton is famous, ambitious, methodical, and clever. As I write, she faces no significant challengers for the Democratic nomination. She is the frontrunner to win the 2016 election. But she is not flawless. Her political skills are limited. She says things she later walks back. She represents the past. There are so many skeletons in her family’s closets that the skeletons have closets. Her favorable numbers have already returned to Earth, and she will spend the next two years under attack by both Democrats and Republicans.

These two items open the door for a campaign by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is demurring less and less these days. Warren, the populist champion, does have deep pockets and deep-pocketed donors. Granted, those donors don’t want her to challenge Hillary. Remember when she was inevitable in 2008? Then, squirrel! 2016 is unlikely to be different. The Clinton Machine, especially with the shellacking of candidates it backed in 2014, is quickly becoming a relic and not the well-oiled engine it once was. Of course, by 2015 Warren will also be old-hat and the really new shiny object will be prepared to disabuse Hillary and Warren of their notions about the presidency.

It’s the Economy, Stupid

But what about those social issues, which didn’t seem to hurt conservatives one iota this cycle? Look, we can have a candidate who is pure on those fronts or we can have a candidate who runs on issues that appeal to a wide swathe of the electorate. Despite my own affinity for science and the truth that life is life, I’d rather not hitch my wagon to a Mike Huckabee or Rick Santorum. Let’s focus on the issues with broad support and make inroads with hearts and minds rather than going all-in on the culture wars.

Ashe Schow makes a similar argument.

What I’m saying is that they need to stay away from partisan social issues they know the Democrats will vote against and that Obama will veto anyway.



Seriously, GOP, take it from someone in a constituency you don’t do well with in presidential elections (unmarried female millennial). Continuously focusing on social issues over jobs is nauseating.

This isn’t a popular sentiment, but the subtext is important. If conservatives head into 2016 with a focus on issues that are doomed to fail, then they risk turning the contest into a referendum on their achievements. And rightly so, especially if all they’ve achieved are a panoply of vetoed bills. Like it or not, the electorate tends to equate passage with governance. Walker’s waffling suggests he understands that. This isn’t to say social issues aren’t important, but that conservatives need to build momentum by attacking Progressives where they are weakest and building upon those successes. When people, including young Millennial women, have money in the bank, then we’ll have the opportunity to start expanding our scope. Walker’s biggest victories may be ones of subtraction, but they also required legislative victories.

The Possibility of Scott Walker’s Victory Lies in the Attack

So should we reassess Walker’s promise now that the joy of the evening, and the fog of the moonshine, has faded? No, we should not. Though Sun Tzu wrote, “Invincibility lies in the defense; the possibility of victory in the attack,” he also wrote, “Move swift as the Wind and closely-formed as the Wood. Attack like the Fire and be still as the Mountain.” Though Walker is wooden and still like the mountains, late in the governor’s race, he also moved with the wind. Perhaps that is his strength. He has a canny ability to lull his opponents into a torpor and await a moment to strike. As we gear up for whomever versus Squirrel! 2016, we should be open to the possibility that winning may best be achieved by someone whose plans are dark and impenetrable as the night, poised to fall like a thunderbolt, and crafted from the extreme comfort of a throne made of the skulls of enemies.

20 Ways Media Completely Misread Congress’ Weak-Sauce Benghazi Report,"On September 11, 2012, Islamist militants attacked U.S. complexes in Benghazi, Libya. Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed, the first U.S. Ambassador killed in the line of duty since 1979. Three other men were killed and 10 were injured.

The media immediately turned it into a political story, focusing more anger on Mitt Romney’s comments about the administration’s blaming of a YouTube video critical of Islam than determining the facts of the attack itself. Many in the media thought it fine that President Obama jetted off to a high-dollar fundraiser before the bodies cooled. When various high-level government officials blamed either a YouTube video critical of Islam — or our laws protecting free speech, it didn’t generate much controversy among big media.

The media tended to parrot White House talking points about the attack even years later. So even though everyone with knowledge of the scene in Benghazi knew otherwise, the New York Times was claiming until Friday — just this past Friday — that al Qaeda had nothing to do with the attack on Benghazi.

Really. Less than one year ago, the New York Times ran one of its massive “projects” — Pulitzer Prize attempts, basically — around the following claim:

Months of investigation by The New York Times, centered on extensive interviews with Libyans in Benghazi who had direct knowledge of the attack there and its context, turned up no evidence that Al Qaeda or other international terrorist groups had any role in the assault. The attack was led, instead, by fighters who had benefited directly from NATO’s extensive air power and logistics support during the uprising against Colonel Qaddafi. And contrary to claims by some members of Congress, it was fueled in large part by anger at an American-made video denigrating Islam.

If there’s something true in that pile of horse manure, you’ll have to point it out. Within days this was thoroughly debunked by those in the know (albeit highlighted by media outlets such as CNN). But just this past Friday afternoon, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence released “the definitive House statement on the Intelligence Community’s activities before, during and after the tragic events that caused the deaths of four brave Americans” in Benghazi. We’ll look through all the flaws with this report (.pdf) here soon, but first we need to talk about the media reaction to same.

Things seemed to kind of get going with this tweet at 5:47 PM:

The report and its appendices are hundreds of pages long. And I’d argue that the executive summary of the report is not well supported by the contents. It took me several hours to read and research it on Saturday and Sunday and I’m not even done with all the appendices. But let’s look at how journalists and media outlets responded:

Do you sense a pattern here? The groupthinkers got to the keyboards and pounded out surprisingly similar headlines, whether they were from far-left partisan groups or just the typically left-leaning (in some cases left-careening) big media:

CNN: Republican-led report debunks Benghazi theories and accusations

Slate: GOP-Controlled Intelligence Committee Debunks Benghazi Conspiracies

Talking Points Memo: GOP Intel Report Debunks Its Own Party’s Nutty Benghazi Theories

Atlanta Journal-Constitution: GOP-led report obliterates Fox News’ version of Benghazi

I could go on and on and on and on and on. In fact, I only found one noteworthy story that didn’t adopt the groupthink.

And within a few hours, the story about this report became about Fox News’ coverage of same. See these tweets with links to stories:

Mediaite (@Mediaite) November 22, 2014

We’re going on six years of many major media outlets completely failing to inform their viewers and readers about numerous Obama administration scandals, but this is what the “media reporters” choose to focus on? Really? In just this past week alone, for instance, we had updates to the IRS scandal relating to targeting of conservative groups (some 30,000 irretrievably lost emails were found), updates to the many scandals surrounding Obamacare’s drafting (note which outlets are carrying substantive updates about Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber) and implementation (thank God for Peter Suderman or we might not have learned about the latest Obamacare surprise coming out in the latest Friday night document dump), news a huge Obama bundler and major gay rights activist being arrested for child rape, reports of emails revealing Department of Justice attempts to silence one of the rare tenacious reporters covering the administration, a teensie weensie little Constitutional problemo about President Obama usurping the legislative process, signing a secret order to extend the war in Afghanistan, and probably a half dozen other things I’m missing.

If there’s a story about media downplaying Obama administration scandal news, and boy is there, this Fox News not giving enough coverage to a weak-sauce Benghazi report sure as hell ain’t it. Let’s look at what else the media missed.

1. Many journalists obviously didn’t read the report.

Much less read it critically.

One might assume this both because of the speed with which they joined the groupthink and their complete and uncritical acceptance of what they heard the report said. I grant that they may have read the 2-page executive summary.

2. They forgot the well-known problems with Congressional oversight

The relationship between intelligence agencies and the members of Congress who are supposed to oversee them could not be more damaged. I’m not even talking about stuff like how the CIA admitted to spying on members of the Senate committee that is supposed to oversee the agency.

It’s actually the good relationships that are even worse. (And I’m not even talking about how sometimes members are married to people who work in the private sector on related topics.) One of the most common criticisms levied against the intelligence oversight committees is that they’re far too approving and accepting of what the intelligence community wants. I’ve covered the federal government for more than 10 years, so I’m familiar with bureaucratic jargon. Still, I was stunned by the level of obfuscating jargon I found in the report, and what a reasonable person might assume that meant:

@MZHemingway the idea that a Republican investigation into darkest CIA ops would yield shining, shocking truths is…implausible



JAMES ❄ POULOS (@jamespoulos) November 22, 2014

Exactly. This is, like, reporting 101. How did so many big-shot reporters miss just that initial skepticism we should all share when reporting on — especially — politicians?

3. “Mistakes were made.”

On May 1, 1973, Nixon’s Press Secretary Ron Ziegler famously said, “I would apologize to the Post, and I would apologize to Mr. Woodward and Mr. Bernstein… We would all have to say that mistakes were made in terms of comments.” Ziegler wasn’t the first to use the line “mistakes were made” but he made it so famous that it was included in obituaries when he died. The phrase is a cliched way to avoid responsibility for wrong-doing and to try to diminish the seriousness of allegations.

Guess what page “mistakes were made” appears in the explosive Benghazi report that supposedly exonerates everybody in the intelligence community that was within 3,000 miles of the deadly attack? Did you guess page one of the executive summary? Congratulations. You win.

4. Actual vs. caricatured complaints about Obama’s handling of Benghazi

Now, if you were to ask people who aren’t reflexively defensive of President Obama (as the media tend to be) what their main concerns with Benghazi were two years ago, they’d probably say something along the lines of:

That we allowed an ambassador to be assassinated by Islamist militants in Libya.

That we didn’t quite seem as concerned as we should have been, as evidenced by our commander-in-chief heading off to a Vegas fundraiser hours after it happened and a general patience about seeking justice.

That we claimed that an attack on September 11 probably actually had something to do with a silly video and nothing to do with Al Qaeda.

probably actually had something to do with a silly video and nothing to do with Al Qaeda. The we officially told the world that “since our founding, the United States has been a nation that respects all faiths. We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others,” as President Obama said.

That our Secretary of State said of a video made by an American that “We absolutely reject its content and message.”



That these statements were dangerously untrue. In America, you’re actually totally allowed to disparage any religion you want. (I myself have fun targeting Methodists.) (Sidenote, check out how our Secretary of State gave a rhetorical beatdown to the Nazis when they complained about a mock trial of Hitler held in Madison Square Gardens in 1934.)

That our media seemed more obsessed with covering for Obama than investigating what the heck happened that night.

Now, the report whitewashes, excuses or glosses over almost all of this and fails completely to get at any of the deeper and troubling questions about what’s wrong with our intel community. It only “debunks” claims if you think that bureaucratic ass-covering and rather strained justifications of what I would hope all Americans would agree was a clear intelligence failure count as “debunking.”

5. Let’s talk about the Feb. 17th Brigade

Here’s a case in point.

The report says that at “appropriately” (I assume they meant “approximately”) 9:40 PM, dozens of militants approached the compound and that “as the men approached, three Libyan security officers in a car outside the [Temporary Mission Facility] drove away without warning U.S. personnel.” Further:

“The State Department had contracted with the February 17th Brigade and the Blue Mountain Group to provide local security for the TMF facility. All available information indicates that the February 17th Brigade guards were inside the walls of the compound and did not detect or report information about the attackers before the attackers breached the gate.”

Now, the report doesn’t mention the Feb. 17th Brigade too much again (we hear the telling — for what it suggests isn’t mentioned — reference to some “helpful” members of the group a few pages later). And maybe it’s telling because the Feb. 17th Brigade — our security contractors — are now allied with Ansar al Sharia — the perpetrators of the attack — and the two groups have taken over large parts of Benghazi. Now, I know that you have to contract with bad guys when you’re doing shady but important work. But don’t you think that maybe a definitive report about how absolutely nothing went wrong in Benghazi that could have been prevented should include that we contracted out our compound security to al Qaeda affiliates there? I mean, maybe the group used to be totes awesome and only went bad after we left. Or, given how things went down, maybe they totally sold us out. But to not even discuss this issue strikes me as odd in the extreme.

Or what about this guy:

Wissam Bin Hamid’s name has surfaced time and again in the investigation into the Benghazi attack. He admittedly met with American officials in Benghazi just days before the assault to discuss security, and he reportedly refused to provide assistance once the attack was underway. The post-revolution Libyan government also worked with Bin Hamid and his Libya Shield militia, which was supposedly one of the strongest “security” forces inside Benghazi.

You will never ever ever guess where this guy is now. OK, if you guessed that a few weeks ago Ansar al Sharia released a 42-minute video featuring him, you win. However, you won’t find any mention of him in this report.

Another weird paragraph says that a Tripoli security team arranged with someone for some particular equipment to be there when they landed in Benghazi. But when they got there, the equipment was nowhere to be found and their interlocutor’s cell phone was turned off. Interesting.

Should these angles have been discussed in the “definitive” report on how everything is awesome? I kind of think so, don’t you?

6. Remember that New York Times report that was only updated on Friday?

I just want to point out that the first line of the report that supposedly makes Republicans look bad places blame for the attack on “armed militias with ties to terrorist organizations, including al-Qa’ida.” And while, yes, the Times did finally get around to updating their report to note that these militias have ties to al Qa’ida, they hedged as much as you could imagine and buried it on page 8. Why are we making fun of FOX, again?

7. Our response was slow.

Now, you can read the report as a big intel agency CYA or you can read it as just a really charitable defense of the decision making that night. But no matter how you read it, it’s striking how slow we were in responding to this crisis.

You know that line about how when seconds count, the police are minutes away? Well, here we had a situation where seconds counted but the nearest security team was 42 minutes away, because of various delays. And the Tripoli team didn’t even start for the air field in Tripoli until after that. And both cited traffic concerns.

Once the Tripoli team finally got to Benghazi, the equipment they arranged for wasn’t there and the group supposed to take them to the hospital (where they believed the ambassador to be) decided they didn’t want to go. The explosive report simply says, “it was not clear why those individuals did not want to travel to the hospital.”

Oh, and the “confusion at the airport lasted for about three and a half hours.” Oh. OK. And then the reason why they were able to leave was because the Libyan Shield brought vehicles to them. But the committee “uncovered no evidence” that the militia tipped off the attackers to the Tripoli Team’s presence. The attack of lethal and deadly accurate mortar fire just happened to take place 11 minutes after they finally arrived at their destination. After some difficulties, they were able to convince Libyan Shield drivers to help them evacuate.

8. Intelligence failures explained away.

A good example of how the report treads softly happens in Section 2, where we’re told that while intelligence agencies knew the threats in Libya were rising, they didn’t have any knowledge of a specific attack.

“There is no evidence of an intelligence failure,” the report says. But by that it simply means that nobody had given the CIA blueprints for an attack. I mean, we do know that Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri “had called for Americans to be targeted in Libya the day before the diplomatic mission was attacked, leading to speculation that al Qaeda’s leadership in Pakistan had some sort of role or influence in the attack.” This would seem to indicate that maybe our confidence al Qaeda had nothing to do with the attack was as misguided as our belief that there was no intel failure in predicting an attack on Americans there.

“One of the first questions [the committee] pursued is whether the U.S. government had or should have had intelligence that could have prevented or disrupted the attacks, and thus whether there was an intelligence failure.” This is idiotic. I mean, you might explain why we had an intel failure but there’s no question that we failed. By definition we failed. We have a dead ambassador, three other dead Americans and 10 severely wounded. All because of a surprise attack we were unprepared for. That’s a failure of the intelligence community.

But instead the report says the Committee “found no evidence of an intelligence failure, and an internal CIA analytic review provided to the Committee on January 4, 2013, corroborates the Committee’s findings.”

Wait, the CIA said the CIA didn’t fail? That’s not surprising at all. I mean, this may be what passes for intelligence committee oversight, but I think most Americans want to know why we weren’t more on top of the Al Qaeda leader’s warning or why we didn’t connect that to one of Al Qaeda’s favorite targets (diplomatic compounds) or why we forgot the significance of September 11. Or just why we weren’t better informed of who was friend and who was foe, who was working with whom and why and what we could do to prevent more dead Americans.

Examples of intel failures are brushed away as uncorroborated. To wit, the CIA apparently reported that “a former Transitional National Council security official in Benghazi said he received, very shortly before the attack, information of a possible imminent attack against the TMF and tried to notify the Libyan Intelligence Service the day of the attacks. However he was unable to make contact and relay the information.” Sounds like a failure. But the committee says it wasn’t corroborated by anyone. OK?

9. Try cutting through the jargon here.

Finding #2 says that the “CIA provided sufficient security personnel, resources, and equipment to defend against the known terrorist threat and to enable CIA operations in Benghazi. There is no evidence that the CIA turned down requests for additional security resources at the Annex.”

Well, we’ve already excused failures by saying that the CIA couldn’t have known of the threat. So the first line that they had appropriate resources for “known” threats is basically meaningless. And we already knew two years ago that Ambassador Stevens requested a beefing up of security.

Now, let’s say the request was never officially turned down but just never fulfilled, which is, in fact, extremely plausible. The end result is a lack of requested security but you could report that “There is no evidence that the CIA turned down requests for additional security.” See how bureaucratic jargon works? It’s like magic. (And if you’re immediately wondering how that first line about “known threats” doesn’t work in conjunction with the knowledge that Stevens requested more security, you are smarter than a typical reporter.)

Does a finding like that really “debunk” the supposed conspiracy theory that there wasn’t enough security? I don’t see how it does. Further, Finding #2 is something of a slap in the face of Ambassador Stevens’ memos to his superiors. These aren’t mentioned in the section.

Should I mention that this section about how everything was hunky dory mentions that “perhaps all of the [Diplomatic Security] agents were unarmed and one of them was not wearing shoes”? Or should I instead Groupthink my way into poking fun at conservatives and telling them to be ashamed?

10. Scathing indictment of how little our Feds understand about al Qaeda

As recently as Friday, the State Department was being mocked for its refusal to acknowledge that Ansar al Sharia is tied to Al Qaeda.

Finding #5 is fairly explicit about how a ragtag group of Al Qaeda affiliates launched the attack.

What’s going on with the State Department’s downplaying of Al Qaeda links? Well, I think it has a lot to do with Obama campaign pledges regarding Al Qaeda. You’d have to be a Major League Gruber to claim that the global Islamist militant movement is waning. But President Obama did make a lot of claims about Al Qaeda being “on its heels” or “on the run” or “decimated” and so on. To wit:

“Now, four years ago, I made a few commitments to you. I told you I’d end the war in Iraq, and I did. I said I’d end the war in Afghanistan, and we are,” said Obama. “I said we’d refocus on the people who actually attacked us on 9/11 — and today, al Qaeda is on its heels and Osama bin Laden is no more.”

To make this campaign rhetoric stick, our executive branch has claimed that it meant “core” al Qaeda as opposed to all the groups al Qaeda oversees and works with. Because if we know anything about al Qaeda it’s not that it’s a powerful decentralized operation with a global network. Oh wait, that’s precisely what we do know.

So Finding #5 says “A mixed group, including members of al-Qa’ida in the lands of the Islamic Meghreb (AQIM), al-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), al-Qaida in Iraq (AQI), the Muhammad Jamal Network (MJN), Ansar al-Sharia (AAS), and Abu Abaydah Ibn Jarah Battalion (UJB) participated in the attacks, along with Qadafi loyalists.

Of course it was a mixed group such as this! It was the White House that consistently downplayed al Qaeda’s involvement for so long. It’s not entirely clear why this finding is such a debunking of what people other than the New York Times have been saying.

11. The involvement of prisoners released from Gitmo

So that New York Times report I keep going back to includes a portion that says this:

The C.I.A. kept its closest watch on people who had known ties to terrorist networks abroad, especially those connected to Al Qaeda. Intelligence briefings for diplomats often mentioned Sufian bin Qumu, a former driver for a company run by Bin Laden. Mr. Qumu had been apprehended in Pakistan in 2001 and detained for six years at Guantánamo Bay before returning home to Derna, a coastal city near Benghazi that was known for a high concentration of Islamist extremists. But neither Mr. Qumu nor anyone else in Derna appears to have played a significant role in the attack on the American Mission, officials briefed on the investigation and the intelligence said.

Again, if you were reading conservative sites, you already knew that this wasn’t true.

But the report says he was almost certainly involved and that he was trained by al Qaeda. And that others who were involved were part of al Qaeda.

12. “They told us to wait.” “Yeah, We told them to wait.”

Remember a few months ago when FOX News had a special documentary “13 Hours at Benghazi”? This was an explosive documentary hosted by Bret Baier that featured three American security forces who were in Benghazi saying they disagreed with how long they were told to wait before trying to rescue folks at TMF.

You can watch the relevant portion here but I’ll just note that these men are speaking on the record about their experience:



Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com

If you’d rather read the relevant portion, here’s a transcript. The guys said they were ready to go within five minutes but they were held back by a top CIA officer named “Bob.”

“It had probably been 15 minutes I think, and … I just said, ‘Hey, you know, we gotta– we need to get over there, we’re losing the initiative,’” said Tiegen. “And Bob just looks straight at me and said, ‘Stand down, you need to wait.’” “We’re starting to get calls from the State Department guys saying, ‘Hey, we’re taking fire, we need you guys here, we need help,’” said Paronto. After a delay of nearly 30 minutes, the security team headed to the besieged consulate without orders. They asked their CIA superiors to call for armed air support, which never came. Now, looking back, the security team said they believed that if they had not been delayed for nearly half an hour, or if the air support had come, things might have turned out differently. “Ambassador Stevens and Sean [Smith], yeah, they would still be alive, my gut is yes,” Paronto said. Tiegen concurred. “I strongly believe if we’d left immediately, they’d still be alive today,” he added… In a statement to Fox News, a senior intelligence official did allow that the security team was delayed from responding while the CIA’s top officer in Benghazi tried to rally local support.

Here’s how this is “debunked” according to the report:

Finding #7: Prior to the CIA security team departing for the TMF, the Annex leadership deliberated thoughtfully, reasonable, and quickly about whether further security could be provided to the team. Although some security officers voiced a greater urgency to depart for the TMF, no officer was ever told to stand down.

Oh where to begin? Now, what the report does is explain the delay, not deny it. It characterizes the delay as thoughtful and reasonable. The guys who went on the record thought it overdone, but that’s a natural disagreement.

But note that while the guys said they were told to “stand down” by a top CIA officer, the “debunkers” say that no CIA officer was told to stand down. Later they say that no “stand down” order was given from CIA HQ or from the Tripoli Team.

Of course, these security guys never said that. They said they were told to stand down by an officer right there who looked them in the eye and was named Bob. Further, it’s rather obvious from the actual interview that their big point of dispute is that they were told to wait. The report confirms that is exactly what happened.

13. Explanations aren’t eviscerations

Similarly, Finding #9 explains “The Tripoli Team’s decision not to move to the hospital to retrieve Ambassador Stevens was based on the best intelligence at the time.”

And yes, this report says, that intelligence turned out to be completely inaccurate. (But remember, there were no intelligence failures, just inaccurate or insufficient intelligence that turned out to be disastrous.) But if the claim is that nobody moved to the hospital to help Stevens, explaining why no one moved isn’t the same thing as “debunking” the claim.

14.No focus on State Department or Defense Department

This isn’t a big thing but it’s worth noting that this review was of intelligence agencies. Therefore, it lacks a substantive discussion of State Department and Defense Department performance. Not that I’d expect any biting oversight of those departments, either, but since those departments also played (or didn’t play, as the case may be) roles in what happened, the lack of focus is just something to consider when declaring, as one media outlet did, the release date of this report the date when Benghazi was no longer up for discussion.

15. Did we mention that there was nothing good about the talking points?

Yeah, so, late in the report we learn that “the Administration’s initial public narrative on the causes and motivations for the attacks were not fully accurate.” You don’t say! Also that “The process and edits made to these talking points was flawed.”

And for this, the GOP should be ashamed? Really? It’s almost like a less obsequious press might think something else might be amiss.

Much of the report wishy-washily explains that there is a fog in intel gathering that makes things difficult to assess and that this kind of sort of excuses all the horse manure that was shoveled by the administration during the campaign-season terrorist attack.

Now, earlier in the report we’re told that “[Ansar al Sharia] posted a video on YouTube on September 12, 2012, claiming participation in the attacks” and we know that the head of al Qaeda called for attacks on the U.S. in Libya the day before the attack. We know that the attack took place on September 11, what even the most casual observer might note is a significant date. We’re told that the Defense Intelligence Agency said the attacks were pre-planned on September 12.

But you see, man, like a few weeks later the CIA totally thought it just happened to fall on September 11.

Let me be clear, as President Obama might say, if you’re a reporter reading this and think this sounds even remotely plausible and you think that this section is anything other than a great explanation of how idiotic the CIA can be, you are an idiot.

Everything about this section is groan-inducing. Such as that when a cable came from Tripoli to the CIA on September 14 that was the “first indication that there may not have been a protest,” according to deputy director Mike Morell, he wasn’t sure if he’d read it. Nevermind that we later learn that folks in Libya had within hours assessed that there was a lack of protests that day. I just have a hard time believing that the deputy director wouldn’t care if a Tripoli intelligence cable came around. Either way, by September 15, he’d gotten an email specifically saying there’d been no protest.

And when did Susan Rice go on television blaming a YouTube video for sparking a protest that somehow magically transformed into this super-effective double-location onslaught that took four American lives including an American Ambassador’s? That would be September 16.

That was when she said the actions in Benghazi were a “direct result of a heinous and offensive video that was widely disseminated.”

This report that supposedly makes Republicans look bad notes that Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes wrote on September 14 that “one of the goals of Administration public statements should be ‘To underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy.'”

Exactly the opposite, Ben.

Anyway, this report then claims, more or less completely implausibly, that Rice couldn’t have really known until afterwards that her assessments were incorrect. Um, OK. But maybe when you’re, I don’t know, trying to “underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy” because you’re focusing on campaigning more than truth-telling, you end up underscoring something that isn’t true. I don’t care if we have some difficult-to-swallow bureaucratic BS explanation that avoids tough questions and instead pats Susan Rice on the head as if she couldn’t be expected to do better. Or, rather, I don’t see why we let certain administrations get away with this type of explanatory defense while nailing other people to the wall for the smallest slight.

16. Wait, what’s this about Mike Morell again?

So the same Morell who accidentally didn’t read a memo related to a horrific terror attack and forgot to tell anyone about the cables from Tripoli also was this guy:

“Finding 12: Deputy CIA Director Michael Morell made significant changes to the talking points”

Wait, what? Are you kidding me?

But, the report says, it’s OK because, um, well, you see, he didn’t know Susan Rice or anyone else in the Administration would use talking points he made. And then the report says something about excellent beachfront property for sale cheap. No, actually it says he “made a large number of edits after a September 15 White House Deputies Committee meeting.” Oh dear.

Earlier drafts of the talking points mentioned al Qaeda but by the time Morell was done with them, he didn’t even include “Islamist” in them. Because our CIA is full of people who do not commit intelligence failures but can’t figure out that an al Qaeda attack on September 11 might be related to Islamism.

By the way, the CIA’s office of public affairs also stripped language about attacks and changed it to “demonstrations” and I am sure that had nothing whatsoever to do with it being an election year or their bosses allowing a major attack on the anniversary of September 11.

17. CIA could have done things better? You don’t say.

Finding #14 says “the CIA could have placed more weight on eyewitness sources on the ground and should have challenged its initial assessments about the existence of a protest earlier.” Of course, its initial assessment was right on. Within hours, the CIA noted that the attack was premeditated and there was no protest. It was politics that changed that rather obvious conclusion. And as noted above, the guys in Tripoli specifically told the agency that they had no evidence of a protest before Susan Rice received talking points making contrary claims.

Looking through all of this talking-point changing and reversal of initial assessments, and White House efforts to make sure everyone believed it was a protest, this whole “what difference does it make?” episode from Hillary Clinton sure doesn’t look any better (though I’m sure the media will continue to give her one of their trademarked passes).

18. Wrongly forced to sign NDAs?

Another finding is that no one was improperly forced to sign non-disclosure agreements. This is in response to the claims made by some that they were encouraged to sign multiple non-disclosure agreements.

The report in fact acknowledges that some of those who were told to sign secondary NDAs felt uncomfortable about it. It says “three of the six contractors who signed new NDAs testified that they believed CIA’s request for the new NDAs appeared odd.” But the committee feels strongly that everything was cool about it.

But how does this debunk reporting that contractors were asked to sign further NDAs or that the request felt it odd? The report confirms it. And it seems sensible that some might find it odd. Reporters shouldn’t delight in CIA explanations for why it was totally no big deal over other claims at odds with CIA talking points.

The report goes into twists and turns to explain that these secondary NDAs weren’t really tied to Benghazi, they just super seem like it. And further the report says that Director Brennan was “factually accurate” when he denied it had anything to do with Benghazi but then suggests he didn’t handle it well. What a mess.

19. If you can’t trust the CIA completely, who can you trust?

Finding #16 is “There is no evidence that the CIA conducted any unusual polygraph exams related to Benghazi.”

You’ll note a few things. Namely the word “unusual” and the phrase “related to Benghazi.” CNN reported that some people who had been in Benghazi were being polygraphed once a month. They also reported that was an unusual rate.

Does the CIA justify its claim by saying once a month is a totally usual rate? That the polygraphs were done at an unusual rate but weren’t actually related to Benghazi but, instead, something else agency related? Is the distinction related to the difference between the journalistic claim regarding “CIA operative” and the CIA claim that “no officer” was polygraphed? We don’t know. There is no substantiating evidence that would make someone believe the CIA over Jake Tapper on this one. Should journalists jump up and down and make partisan clowns out of themselves before asking these questions?

20. What a waste of two years.

The conclusion to the report claims “This report is the result of nearly two years of intensive investigation.” I’d like to see how they define intensive.

Because if you spend two years to come up with a report that one of our worst failures was not preventable and you don’t even explore, say, whether we were sold out by supposed friends who turn out to be al Qaeda affiliated, what are you doing with your time?

If I wanted to read a bunch of unconvincing explanations for bad behavior, I’d talk to a group of poorly disciplined children. We should expect a bit more from an oversight committee.

And as for the clown show of our reporter class who spent the last couple of years making B-E-N-G-H-A-Z-I acrostics? Joking about dead ambassadors and lacking curiosity are not as good looking as you think.

Leftist Media Show How Not To Defend Rolling Stone UVA Rape Story,"Several days ago, Rolling Stone published a horrifying tale of a gang rape at a University of Virginia fraternity. Jackie (her real name, we’re told) says she was on a date at a frat party with a boy she liked and knew well. He took her upstairs at his fraternity house, into a completely darkened room, and orchestrated an unspeakably brutal rape by seven men, she said. He and another man observed. The rape began by pushing her onto a glass table that shattered, she said. She reported the violence, which included rape by beer bottle and assault to her face, occurred on a bed of broken glass.

Jackie finally escaped, bloodied and battered. She attracted no known attention as she left the house. She said she called three friends. One thought that maybe she should go to the hospital while the others thought it would hurt their chances at being invited back to the fraternity house.

The reaction to the piece was swift and fierce. All fraternity activities at UVA have been suspended, the campus community is calling for reform, and the story has generated nationwide attention. In general, the story comes at a time when people across the political spectrum are demanding explanations for why colleges don’t do a better job of report sexual assaults to the police. With the police now on the case of this incident, albeit years after it allegedly occurred, people are hoping that some justice will be meted out.

All of which brings us to an interesting story about how the journalism regarding this incident has been handled.

Journalistic norms

The first person to raise questions, apparently, was editor Richard Bradley. A former editor of fabulist Stephen Glass, Bradley wrote about some questions he had about the central anecdote on which the entire article is based.

Nothing is terribly surprising, journalistically, in “Is The Rolling Stone Story True?” I didn’t go to journalism school but every editor I’ve ever worked with on a hot story asked the same type of questions he asks in this piece.

He notes that the story could of course be completely 100% true but that for a variety of reasons he doesn’t believe that it happened in the way it is described. He is critical in part because this story plays into existing biases about fraternities, men, the South, young women, rape culture, and university bureaucracies.

He notes that Jackie is never identified. That the three friends are not interviewed and not named. One, we’re told, declined an interview out of loyalty to his own fraternity. Also this:

Then there’s the fact that Jackie apparently knew two of her rapists, but they are not named, nor does Rubin Erdley contact them, which is basically a cardinal rule of journalism: If someone in your story is accused of something, you’d better do your damnedest to give them a chance to respond. There’s no sign that Rubin Erdley did so. Why not? Did she not know their names? Would Jackie not tell her? Because if Rubin Erdley knew their names and didn’t call them, that is horrible journalism and undermines confidence in her reporting. And if she didn’t know their names—well, we’re back in Patrick Witt-land again.

He goes on to detail other concerns.

Others have followed suit. Robby Soave at Reason wrote pieces about the initial story last week. “Treating rape as akin to plagiarism trivializes violence against women,” he wrote in one. This week he reflected on Bradley’s questions with a piece “Is the UVA Rape Story a Gigantic Hoax?”

Judith Shulevitz at The New Republic has also weighed in with “Rolling Stone Never Gave the Villains of Its Gang Rape Story a Chance to Defend Themselves.”

My own antenna went up on this article when I read the Washington Post’s piece, by Paul Farhi, about how the story was written. One thing in the article stood out as interesting and one thing was disconcerting. The interesting thing is that we’re told “Magazine writer Sabrina Rubin Erdely knew she wanted to write about sexual assaults at an elite university.”

There is absolutely nothing wrong with that, although it’s a bit telling how stories are chosen. She tried Harvard, Yale, Princeton and University of Pennsylvania before deciding on the University of Virginia. Note these two paragraphs:

Erdely spent weeks corroborating details of Jackie’s account, including such minutiae as her work as a lifeguard. She concluded: “I find her completely credible. It’s impossible to know for certain what happened in that room, because I wasn’t in it. But I certainly believe that she described an experience that was in­cred­ibly traumatic to her.” Some elements of the story, however, are apparently too delicate for Erdely to talk about now. She won’t say, for example, whether she knows the names of Jackie’s alleged attackers or whether in her reporting she approached “Drew,” the alleged ringleader, for comment. She is bound to silence about those details, she said, by an agreement with Jackie, who “is very fearful of these men, in particular Drew. . . . She now considers herself an empty shell. So when it comes down to identifying them, she has a very hard time with that.”

Well that’s odd. I agree with Bradley completely that at least trying to interview the attackers is not optional. The fraternity in question was named. Drew’s identified by job and class. At least one other alleged attacker was known to Jackie from a class they took together. In other interviews, Erdely gives similarly cryptic non-responses to questions about journalistic diligence. The idea you’d corroborate work as a lifeguard but not talk to the people who are being accused of horrific violence boggles the journalistic mind.

Farhi writes that “In any case, there have been no outright denials from any party about the alleged crime Erdely reported, a rarity given the relative specificity of the allegations and the enormous impact of the story.” Except that the specificity is in no way specific enough to make the Post’s claim stand up. Who, exactly, would issue a denial? And on what grounds, exactly? Erdely certainly should have made sure that these alleged attackers existed and that, if so, they had a chance to respond. But I am not sure it’s “rare” for anyone specific to issue a denial for something as vague as the claims being made here.

Farhi wisely followed up in another piece “Author of Rolling Stone article on alleged U-Va. rape didn’t talk to accused perpetrators.” In it, he writes, “Erdely declined to address specific questions about her reporting when contacted on Sunday and Monday” and “Erdely indicated that she was unable to locate the fraternity brothers in the course of her reporting to get their side of the story.” She has their nicknames, their fraternity, their classes, and other details. If they were truly that hard to locate, that is noteworthy and should have been mentioned in the 9,000-word story.

How Not To Respond

Absolutely no one knows what happened in the alleged incident other than the people involved. We have no known hospital records, no police records, no corroborating eyewitness testimony, no discussion with the alleged perpetrators, no discussion with the three friends we’re told saw her in the immediate aftermath, no discussion of physical evidence (e.g. What happened to the dress the victim wore? How bad are the victim’s scars from the shattered glass? How were they treated?).

People who have accepted the story uncritically don’t know what happened any more than people who are skeptical of aspects of same.

If one believes that this story, as written, satisfies journalism norms about checking claims made by sources and allowing people to defend themselves against claims made about them, one should make the case in response to the questions people are raising.

Here are some ways not to do it.

There are UVa truthers, because of course http://t.co/Gf6gtlzCQd



Marin Cogan (@marincogan) December 1, 2014

Slate’s Jamelle Bouie agreed. As did this Planned Parenthood official.

Now, maybe asking that claims of unspeakably brutal gang rape be better substantiated does make you a conspiracy theorist. But I don’t see how. And claiming that you’re a crazy “truther” when you raise questions is not going to convince many people. This “gaslighting” seems like an unnecessary short-cut to having a healthy conversation.

One journalist I follow on Twitter was outraged by the initial reports. She’s an alum of UVA and is incredibly disappointed in how her institution has handled sexual assault claims. Still, she expressed concern at the journalistic practice of not interviewing the accused. She said checking claims is “journalism 101.” I agree.

But other media dismiss any questions about the story as a function of sexism. And let’s note how Jezebel is responding to questions about the journalism behind the story.

Writer Anna Merlan never manages to answer any of the questions raised by those concerned about the journalism practices but she does manage to spew out errors and mischaracterize those who do have questions (you can read more here or here).

In summary, what we have here are two dudes who have some vague suspicions and, on that basis, are implying that Ederley either fabricated her story or failed to do her due diligence and didn't fact check what Jackie told her. Never mind that she gave a long interview to the Washington Post this weekend about the weeks she spent fact-checking the story. Erdely explains in that interview, too, that she won't discuss some details about Jackie's alleged attackers because of an agreement she made with Jackie, who is, she tells the paper ""very fearful of these men, in particular Drew. . . . She now considers herself an empty shell. So when it comes down to identifying them, she has a very hard time with that."" But never mind Erdely's months of work. Two guys who have no idea what they're talking about don't believe it. Case closed.

Nope. See, you could spend years “fact-checking” a story and if your fact checking doesn’t involve, you know, talking to the alleged perpetrators, the people we’re told saw her immediately afterwards, or anything else apart from time spent as a lifeguard, it’s not really going to answer the questions raised by editors and others who see question-asking as a good journalism trait. Journalists should also be aware that memory is a tricky thing even under the best of conditions. The science on how our memories can be warped is quite interesting, but under no cases should journalists write up a traumatic event using only the memory of one person without any attempt to corroborate the details of the event. Checking the lifeguard status is a great start as opposed to an end point, then.

Maligning those who ask questions as conspiracy theorists or idiots is not what journalists should be in the business of doing. Journalists should also not just accept stories without asking questions. Question asking is not a tool of the patriarchy, y’all. It’s just journalism 101. It should be celebrated, not shamed.

Bret Stephens wrote at the Wall Street Journal:

It isn’t surprising that a generation of journalists schooled in the idea that “narrative” contains truth independent of fact are so easily taken in by stories that ultimately prove less than accurate, if not utterly untrue. Nor is it surprising that American distrust in the news media is near an all-time high. Bad journalism is bad for journalism, and good journalists have a responsibility and an interest in calling out sensationalist stories whose details ring false even as they play to what we’re inclined to believe is true.

It’s not just about journalism, though. It’s wonderful if journalism can help victims of crimes and hold criminals accountable. One of the ways it can do that is by being ruthlessly diligent in how stories such as this are reported. We know from past experience that uncritical acceptance of source’s stories can lead to bad results. So it’s in the best interest of everyone if journalists check out all claims, no matter how sensitive.

Maybe Erdely has good reasons for not being forthright yet about the due diligence she performed in this case. I hope she and her editor can do a better job of answering the growing questions about how this story was reported.

Sydney Siege: Coming Soon to a Starbucks Near You,"After hours of speculation overnight about whether the gunman holding hostages at a downtown cafe in Sydney, Australia, might be an Islamic terrorist—despite his pretty clear gesture of forcing his captives to block the cafe’s windows with the traditional black flag of the jihadists—the gunman has issued demands that include, you guess it, being provided with an official Islamic State flag.

Thanks for clearing that up.

There are a couple of other things this jihadist SOB has helpfully cleared up for us.

First, there is the question of whether terrorist attacks are “blowback” for American military operations overseas. Well, does anyone really think that the top priority of the jihadists is to strike a blow against evil Australian imperialism? To be sure, Australia has been a reliable ally that has contributed troops and support for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But they’re not such a dominant force as to be a headline target for jihadists, and to my knowledge they haven’t been involved in recent airstrikes against the Islamic State.

No, the Sydney attack probably has more to do with Australia’s significant population of Muslim immigrants, some of whom are unassimilated and disaffected. The latest report is that the hostage taker has been identified as Man Haron Monis, “a 49-year-old self-styled ‘Muslim cleric and peace activist'” who fled Iran five years ago. I’m not saying that Australia shouldn’t take in immigrants from the Middle East, particularly since many recent Iranian immigrants were themselves fleeing an Islamist regime. But this does indicate that terrorism is less a reaction to Western military intervention than it is about the dangerous influence of jihadism within the “religion of peace.” It’s not about us, it’s about them. This is about the radical Islamists’ yearning to strike out against anyone who is not a Muslim.

Second, this incident gives the lie to the idea that the civil war in Syria is none of our business. Three years of dithering and refusing to take sides and treating Syria as if it really were none of our business made room for the rise of the Islamic State—and the success of the Islamic State is now rallying radical Islamists worldwide. There will be some discussion about whether this attack was planned as part of a wider conspiracy or whether it was a “lone wolf” attack, but that’s not a very comforting distinction, is it?

Islamic terrorism thrives on examples of success. The Muslim god is a god of war, and his prophet was a victorious conqueror. The example of a strident and victorious Islamist movement that carries all before it is a palpable incitement to other aspiring jihadists, whether they are directly linked to the Islamic State, or whether they’re just fanboys.

There might even be some wisdom to that old notion about fighting them over there so we won’t have to fight them over here.

That leads us to the final thing that is clarified by the Sydney attack. This is the next wave of terrorism.

Any time a show is this successful, they make a sequel. Terrorism is all about theater, about making a big splash and going down in a blaze of glory on behalf of the Muslim faith. That photo of terrified hostages holding the black flag of jihad up against the windows of an upscale cafe will be electrifying to other angry and disaffected Islamists. Anyone who cannot make it to Syria to join the jihad there—or, just as likely, someone who has already been there and come back—will see this as a new, highly effective way to bring terror to our streets.

This has been the trend for a while: many small lone wolf attacks in place of one big organized attack. The Fort Hood shooter, the would-be Times Square bomber, the machete attack on Lee Rigby, and so on. So it’s a minor miracle that what is happening in Sydney hasn’t already happened in Manhattan. We should assume that it is only a matter of time.

That’s the grimmest message from this story. You may not be interested in the War on Terrorism, but it is interested in you. Jihadism is back, and it may be coming soon to a Starbucks near you.

Everything You Need To Know About Voxsplaining The Charlie Hebdo Massacre,"Sometime in the Paleolithic past, one guy said to his friends, “Hey, have you ever noticed how small Steve the Chief’s brow is? Look at me, I’m Steve No-Brow.” Everyone laughed, then Steve the Chief caved the guy’s head in with a rock. Human affairs with regards to unauthorized satire remained the same for the next 100,000 years or so, with the only difference being who was holding the biggest rock.

Wednesday’s terrorist attack on the office of French satire magazine Charlie Hebdo is a grim reminder that the last couple hundred years of increased tolerance for unfettered speech is largely an anomaly. Viewed over the course of history, freedom of speech as an ideal can only be seen as a bizarre fetish, propagated by a few lone cranks and out of step with humanity’s preference for order, deference to raw power, and violence as a means of achieving those preferences.

I say this because, over at Vox, Ezra Klein has an article on the Charlie Hebdo attack that is wildly divorced from both current and past history. Klein writes that the murder of Charlie Hebdo’s employees “can’t be explained by a close read of an editorial product, and they needn’t be condemned on free speech grounds.”

“They can only be explained,” Klein continues, “by the madness of the perpetrators, who did something horrible and evil that almost no human beings anywhere ever do, and the condemnation doesn’t need to be any more complex than saying unprovoked mass slaughter is wrong.”

Basically Everything Ezra Klein Said Is Wrong

As to the first point, it’s hard to see how the murders couldn’t be explained by looking at Charlie Hebdo’s brazen, blasphemous content. Does Klein think Charlie Hebdo would have been targeted if it produced French pastries, instead of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed? It strains credulity, even in Vox-world, to say yes. Would Klein consider the firebombing of a magazine office—which happened to Charlie Hebdo in 2011—anything other than an attack on free speech if it occurred at another publication? One would at least hope so.

We’ve graduated from heavy rocks, but not as much as some of us would like to imagine.

Second, a brief glance at the twentieth century should be enough to dispel the notion that the attackers were anything but cold, calculating humans. The perpetrators did something that humans, especially under the auspices of government, have done for 99 percent of recorded history: shut up people they didn’t like. We’ve graduated from heavy rocks, but not as much as some of us would like to imagine.

We tend to think of the value of free speech as a settled argument, but nothing could be farther from the truth—not in the United States and certainly not abroad. Sure, if you asked ten people on the street if they like free speech, you would likely get ten enthusiastic yesses, but you might get a very different reaction if you handed them a newspaper blaspheming their most cherished beliefs—religion, politics, themselves—and asking them if it should be allowed to be printed.

What Charlie Hebdo did to great effect was put that issue in people’s hands and force them to consider where they stood. The editors and cartoonists of Charlie Hebdo knew where they stood. After Charlie Hebdo’s office was firebombed, the magazine put out its most famous edition. The cover showed the cartoonist and a presumably Muslim man embraced in a sloppy kiss, with the headline, “L’amour plus fortque la haine.” Love is stronger than hate. They made a brave, irrational bet.

Self-Censorship Is Cowardice

In the aftermath of the most recent attack on Charlie Hebdo, many publications will trumpet their dedication to free speech while tut-tutting the magazine’s insistence on publishing immature, inflammatory images. Free speech is all well and good, but can’t we please be oh so careful not to offend? For example, here’s the Financial Times:

Charlie Hebdo has a long record of mocking, baiting and needling French Muslims. If the magazine stops just short of outright insults, it is nevertheless not the most convincing champion of the principle of freedom of speech. France is the land of Voltaire, but too often editorial foolishness has prevailed at Charlie Hebdo.



This is not in the slightest to condone the murderers, who must be caught and punished, or to suggest that freedom of expression should not extend to satirical portrayals of religion. It is merely to say that some common sense would be useful at publications such as Charlie Hebdo, and Denmark’s Jyllands-Posten, which purport to strike a blow for freedom when they provoke Muslims, but are actually just being stupid.

Meanwhile, other news outlets are going out of their way to censor or avoid publishing the images that led to the attack on Charlie Hebdo.

The subtext in all these arguments, acts of self-censorship, and obfuscation of the attack’s root causes, never outright stated, is fear. Fear that hate is stronger than love, fear that after all these thousands of years, we still can’t take a joke. The employees of Charlie Hebdo went to work on Wednesday, like they did every day, hoping to prove history wrong. To say, as Klein does, that their murders are “not a statement, or a controversy,” ignores what they lived and died for.

Men Without Chests: How C.S. Lewis Predicted Charlie Hebdo Censorship,"“It is an outrage that they should be commonly spoken of as Intellectuals. This gives them the chance to say that he who attacks them attacks Intelligence. It is not so. They are not distinguished from other men by an unusual skill in finding truth nor any virginal ardour to produce her…It is not excess of thought but defect of fertile and generous emotion that marks them out. Their heads are no bigger than the ordinary: it is the atrophy of the chest beneath that makes them seem so.” —C.S. Lewis, “The Abolition of Man”

Western news organizations are falling all over themselves to censor images that raise the ire of violent terrorists, and C.S. Lewis predicted their exact behavior over 70 years ago when he published “The Abolition of Man,” his treatise on how the corruption of language leads inevitably to the corruption of mind and soul. Which brings us to the pathetic and censorious response by so many media organizations to the Islamic terrorist attack against Charlie Hebdo, a French satirical publication.

The main photo for this story is courtesy of the New York Daily News. (The absurd pixelation of the cartoon on the front page of the Charlie Hebdo paper was done by the New York Daily News, not by The Federalist.)

The New York Daily News’s censorship is emblematic of the response of far too many media organizations to the Charlie Hebdo massacre. Peaceful people who are offended must deal with offense, but violent sociopaths who are thrown into murderous rages by cartoons? Their feelings must be respected. Welcome to 2015, where polite requests for decency are ignored, and childish temper tantrums are exalted as the means by which developmentally stunted neanderthals get whatever they want. Which brings us to CNN.

Following the Charlie Hebdo attack, CNN allegedly issued a memo to staff detailing what types of images and words would be banned by the network and what would be allowed:

Although we are not at this time showing the Charlie Hebdo cartoons of the Prophet considered offensive by many Muslims, platforms are encouraged to verbally describe the cartoons in detail. This is key to understanding the nature of the attack on the magazine and the tension between free expression and respect for religion.



Video or stills of street protests showing Parisians holding up copies of the offensive cartoons, if shot wide, are also OK. Avoid close-ups of the cartoons that make them clearly legible.



It’s also OK to show most of the protest cartoons making the rounds online, though care should be taken to avoid examples that include within them detailed depictions of the Charlie Hebdo cartoons.

Where to begin? For starters, note that the network is apparently afraid of even using the word Muhammad. Instead, the Islamic religious figure is referred to by CNN merely as “the Prophet.” Not a prophet. And not even the prophet. “The Prophet,” with a capital P.

If we are to take CNN’s memo at its word, no other prophets existed before or after Muhammad. He is literally the only one. Forget Moses. Forget Abraham. Forget that both are major prophets for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

Nope. Muhammad is the only one (even if that statement itself is heretical to the ideology they’re desperately trying not to offend) and he will be faux-respected by fearful news executives, even if that faux respect results in the blatant disrespect of other religions that outright reject Muhammad’s alleged teachings. Your offense is only worthy of note if comes packaged with a death threat.

I look forward to CNN referring to Jesus Christ as “the Messiah” from now on. I look forward to CNN referring to God as “G-d” out of respect for Jews who believe it is sinful to utter His name. And I really look forward to never seeing another historically illiterate Eastertime screed masquerading as news about how Jesus is just a silly myth who never really existed and that people who put any stock in the most well-attested historical documents in all of antiquity are just a bunch of nutty kooks.

I mean, if we’re talking about respect for religion, surely that must mean respect for religions that don’t send masked terrorists to gun down your news bureau whenever it publishes something stupid and insensitive, right? Or do my views only deserve respect insofar as they refuse to acknowledge your right to even exist?

For the Men Without Chests, however, history, theology, and even grammar must bow before the altar of terrorism.

CNN, a television network that exists to broadcast images to the world, instructed its employees to avoid the use of pictures and instead use words to describe the cartoon images. Did I mention that CNN is a TV station? And that the whole point of TV is to display images? Because it is. That’s why TV exists. To display images. Unless you’re CNN. And how did CNN justify its ban on pictures? It said it was necessary because “[verbal descriptions] are key to understanding the nature of the attack on the magazine and the tension between free expression and respect for religion.”

A TV executive with with an allegedly functioning brain actually wrote that the key — not a key, but the key — to understanding a murderous attack over cartoon images is to…only use spoken words to describe the images, rather than, oh, I don’t know, show the actual images.

But at least CNN gave its staff the freedom to publish cartoons protesting the killings in Paris, though. At least CNN had the decency to show images protesting the barbaric attacks in Paris. Right? Right??

It’s also OK to show most of the protest cartoons making the rounds online, though care should be taken to avoid examples that include within them detailed depictions of the Charlie Hebdo cartoons.

Oh. Okay, then. We wouldn’t want a news organization to air detailed depictions of the raison d’etre for France’s deadliest terrorist attack in two decades. And we certainly can’t have a news organization faithfully reporting on criticism of the attackers or their ideology. That would just be too much.

I don’t personally believe in modern day, post-Christian prophets, but if I did, I’d have to assume C.S. Lewis was one of them, because he saw this nonsense coming. He saw how the deliberate corruption of language leads inexorably to the degradation of society and the eventual corruption of mankind. We are seeing it now: let’s pretend that certain things don’t mean what they mean so that we may hopefully be the last up against the wall when the violent and perpetually offended hordes finally take control.

Maybe if we just call him “The Prophet” and tut-tut his detractors under our breath, his zealous followers will leave us alone and instead attack those fools who called him “a prophet,” or — gasp — used his actual name, or — even worse — drew a picture of him. Maybe they will look upon us with favor and spare us as a way of repaying our subservience to their ideology. Maybe our deliberate corruption of language in service of a violent strain of religion will signal that we mean them no harm. Maybe our weakness will be seen as strength. Maybe our lack of spine will be seen as courage. Maybe up will be down, hot will be cold, and slavery will be freedom.

“In a sort of ghastly simplicity,” C.S. Lewis wrote, “we remove the organ and demand the function”:

We make men without chests and expect of them virtue and enterprise. We laugh at honour and are shocked to find traitors in our midst. We castrate and bid the geldings be fruitful.

This is a society of men without chests. This is CNN.

Dear Rand Paul; Tell Dad to Shut Up,"If Rand Paul wants to have any chance of running for the Republican nomination for president in 2016, not to mention the presidency itself, there is one thing he needs to do immediately.

Tell Dad to shut up.

In response to the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris, Ron Paul took a break from his usual blame-America-first rhetoric to blame France first. On an internet television show, Paul the Elder declared, “France has been a target for many, many years, because they’ve been involved in foreign affairs in Libya, and they really prodded us along in—recently in Libya, but they’ve been involved in Algeria, so they’ve had attacks like this, you know, not infrequently.” He continued:

I put blame on bad policy that we don’t fully understand, and we don’t understand what they’re doing because the people who are objecting to the foreign policy that we pursue, they do it from a different perspective. They see us as attacking them, and killing innocent people, so yes, they, they have—this doesn’t justify, so don’t put those words in my mouth—it doesn’t justify, but it explains it…. It’s that overall policy which invites retaliation.

This is absurd on a number of levels. First, many of the Western interventions that Paul cites were efforts to attack and destroy Islamic terrorist groups. It now appears, for example, that the leader of the Paris attack was previously jailed for recruiting French Muslims to fight for al-Qaeda in Iraq. So when we attack Islamic terrorist networks, Islamic terrorists become angry with us. Thanks for that nugget of wisdom, but it doesn’t make the destruction of terrorist networks any less desirable. (As for the Paris attacker’s claim that he supported al-Qaeda because he was angry about US abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib, this requires that you forget the giant, systematic war crimes perpetrated by jihadists wherever they try to seize power, as the Islamic State has recently reminded us in Syria.)

More important, there is no reason to believe that Charlie Hebdo was attacked as a protest against French foreign policy. If you take the attackers’ own reported claims at face value, they were attacking to “avenge the prophet” against insults from the tabloid’s cartoonists. And if you still don’t believe that this is the motive, British radical Anjem Choudary has taken to the pages of USA Today and helpfully explained to us that Islamists such as himself “do not believe in the concept of freedom of expression” and regard blasphemy as a capital offense. You don’t say.

But Ron Paul wants to overrule the Islamists’ own statement of their motives. I call this Bin Laden Syndrome by Proxy: taking someone else’s terrorist attack, fantasizing what you think his motives ought to be according to your world view, and then using the attack to try to get everyone to climb onto your own ideological hobby horse.

It goes without saying that there isn’t much of a market for that outlook, particularly among the Republican base. It smacks too much of appeasement. There might be some good reasons to alter our foreign policy, but avoiding the anger of our sworn enemies is not one of those reasons.

So if Rand Paul wants a chance in 2016, he has to convince his father to zip it.

Then again, Paul the Elder’s views don’t come out of nowhere. They come from the same old-style libertarian base that Paul the Younger is no doubt counting on to jump-start his campaign.

The old libertarians are not just advocates of small government or limited government. They regard government as such as the enemy. Even those who are not openly declared anarchists—and there were plenty of those—are hard-pressed to admit find any branch of government they would support, and that hatred and suspicion of government extends to the police and the military. As a result, the libertarians have generally borrowed the foreign policy of the far left, in which American “imperialism” and the “military-industrial complex” are always the real enemy. When you spend your time nursing an unwarranted hostility toward your own country, you tend to end up indulging an unwarranted sympathy toward its sworn enemies.

So maybe Ron Paul should keep on talking. If he isn’t doing his son any favors, he might do us some favors by reminding us where Rand Paul came from and leading us to ask some hard questions about how far the apple has fallen from the tree.

Ron And Rand Paul Duel Over Root Causes Of Charlie Hebdo Attack,"Sen. Rand Paul is proving that the apple does fall far from the tree. While his father, Ron Paul, is out blaming France’s foreign policy for the Charlie Hebdo massacre due to its involvement in Libya, Paul the younger is putting the blame exactly where it needs to be: on radical Islam and the danger of open borders.

Robert Tracinski has written that Rand needs to tell his “dad to shut up” because France’s foreign interventions had nothing to do with the killings. It looks like Paul the younger is doing that—in a very subtle way, of course. Tracinski is right: Charlie Hebdo wasn’t attacked because of French foreign policy. It was to avenge the prophet Muhammad.

If you take the attackers’ own reported claims at face value, they were attacking to ‘avenge the prophet’ against insults from the tabloid’s cartoonists. And if you still don’t believe that this is the motive, British radical Anjem Choudary has taken to the pages of USA Today and helpfully explained to us that Islamists such as himself ‘do not believe in the concept of freedom of expression’ and regard blasphemy as a capital offense.

Rand Paul gets this. On Sean Hannity’s radio show Thursday, he said, “What it points out to us is the utter barbarity of the people who are opposing us. . . This barbarous aberration of religion is opposed to the free flow of ideas.” As such, he said, “civilized Islam” needs to speak out and condemn the shootings.

Not only that, France needs more border security. “You’ve got to secure your country. And that means maybe that every Muslim immigrant that wishes to come to France shouldn’t have an open door to come.”

Paul brought that message home: “It’s also my concern here. I think our border is a danger to attack, as well as our student visa program. Several of the attackers on 9/11 were here on student visas they had overstayed.”

Paul’s statement is a strong reminder of his position on immigration, setting himself apart from others in the GOP presidential field, such as pro-amnesty Jeb Bush.

Paul has stated, “I do not support amnesty, I support legal immigration and recognize that the country has been enriched by those who seek the freedom to make a life for themselves. However, millions of illegal immigrants are crossing our border without our knowledge and causing a clear threat to our national security. I want to work in the Senate to secure our border immediately. In addition, I support the creation of a border fence and increased border patrol capabilities.”

So, while Paul the elder is blaming foreign intervention for this attack, Paul the younger is steering clear of that view, and once again, distinguishing himself from his father and establishing himself as a viable and strong candidate for the presidency.

"Let’s Blame Christianity For Everything, And Islam For Nothing","After Islamic terrorists invade a newspaper office and murder 12 people, the first reaction from impartial observers should most assuredly not be to condemn Catholics for the Spanish Inquisition.

Yet this is the disgusting and ahistorical message many liberal advocates of moral equivalence shared on social media. Remember that Christians have been violent, too, in the name of religion, and don’t say anything bad about Islam. Jon Harmon, the legislative director for Cincinnati Council member Chris Seelbach, tweeted, in an attack on CNN anchor Don Lemon, “Embarrassing. Will @donlemon ask Catholics if they support molester priests or the Spanish Inquisition?”

We don’t have to ask. The Catholic Church years ago apologized for the Spanish Inquisition. On March 12, 2000, Pope John Paul II said, “We are deeply saddened by the behavior of those who in the course of history have caused these children of yours to suffer, and asking your forgiveness we wish to commit ourselves to genuine brotherhood.” In fact, Pope John Paul II apologized for a number of things during his papacy, including the crusades and the imprisonment of Galileo.

The apology doesn’t take away from the brutality of the act, but at least it acknowledges wrongdoing. What does the Inquisition have to do with the attack on Charlie Hebdo? Nothing, specifically, unless you consider how the actions of Islamic terrorist groups today such as the Islamic State are as vicious or worse than the Inquisition.

Why Is Islam Exempt from Criticism?

But it is instructive how some on the Left are so quick to condemn Christianity for anything—even for something (the attack on Charlie Hebdo) that Christianity had nothing to do with. It would be hard to imagine a liberal reminding readers about 9/11 after a Christian extremist bombed an abortion clinic, for example, or urging tolerance of the moderate Americans, the vast majority, after a bigoted extremist shoots up a mosque. In the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo murders, the New York Times originally included a claim by a victim that an assailant spared her but demanded she convert to Islam. Later, the paper edited the passage to remove the call for forced conversion.

Who would be scared of offending the sensibilities of a follower of the ‘Religion of Peace’?

The reticence to publish cartoons of Muhammad contributes to an atmosphere where one religion is put on a pedestal above all others. On one hand, people are legitimately scared to do so. No one needs to be told why. A 2012 cartoon in The Onion after the “Innocence of Muhammad” controversy depicted Jesus, Moses, Ganesha, and Buddha engaging in a graphic orgy under the headline, “No One Murdered Because Of This Image.”

Ironically, it is the absence of Muhammad in print that speaks the most negatively about the religion. Who would be scared of offending the sensibilities of a follower of the “Religion of Peace”? It is understandable why media institutions take the policy they do for reasons of safety, but that policy should not be couched in terms of morality or sensibilities. If it were, then that would call into question why so much other imagery is fair game (as such imagery should be).

They’re Scared for Their Lives—Which Says Something

Sometimes even the most ardent atheist critics of religious fundamentalism find they must attack Christianity or “religion” before zeroing in on Islam. Beyond fearing potentially for their lives if they offend the wrong person, they also fear for their reputations, lest they get tarred as “Islamophobic.”

Salon’s Erin Kean denounced Bill Maher for ‘sounding eerily like the religious extremists,’ a claim of moral equivalence that again puts speech on the same level with murder.

Bill Maher can be praised for being consistent. After the attack, Maher went on Jimmy Kimmel’s show and said, “I know most Muslim people would not have carried out an attack like this. But here’s the important point. Hundreds of millions of them support an attack like this. They applaud an attack like this.” It was an echo of his argument with Ben Affleck on his own show in October, in which he and Sam Harris pointed to surveys that showed a distressing amount of Muslims in various countries support criminalizing blasphemy with the death penalty. For that, Maher and Harris were called “racists.”

After his comments on Kimmel, Salon’s Erin Kean denounced Maher for “sounding eerily like the religious extremists,” a claim of moral equivalence that again puts speech on the same level with murder. Richard Dawkins was slammed on Salon for having tweeted, “No, all religions are NOT equally violent. Some have never been violent, some gave it up centuries ago. One religion conspicuously didn’t,” and Sean Hannity got the treatment for suggesting that immigrants should be “assimilated” so as not to support such extremism.

Earth to Liberals: Discussing Islam’s Problems Isn’t Bigotry

Of course no form of bigotry is justified, including anti-Islamic bigotry, but discussing major problems is not the same as bigotry. Liberals have spent the past few months condemning police institutions for what they view as racist policing practices that contribute to the shootings of unarmed black men. The Tea Party has been slammed by liberals as “racist” ever since it came into existence. Although the individual characterizations of both issues can be debated, no one should condemn the practice of using harsh rhetoric to confront harsh realities. Religious institutions should not be off limits just because they are religious.

Whether it’s ‘Piss Christ’ or paintings of the Virgin Mary toting a gun, Christians don’t respond by running in with guns and bombs.

If Maher and Dawkins were wrong, then why would their critics have to reach back centuries to pull out a sufficient counterexample? Organized Christianity doesn’t exert near the radical influence now as it did then. Reformations within the church and the Enlightenment have changed matters.

That we even have the debate of whether to publish the cartoons illustrates the point. Artistic exhibitions that offend Christians have been displayed in America and Europe without violent reprisal. Whether it’s “Piss Christ” or paintings of the Virgin Mary toting a gun, followers of the Virgin Mary’s religion don’t come running in with guns and bombs. There have been some exhibitions, such as Cosimo Cavallaro’s “Chocolate Jesus,” that have been canceled due to pressure from organized Christian groups, but the pressure in that case came through boycotts, not bloodshed.

A comparable depiction of Muhammad would never even get past the approval stage of a major museum. Jesus is depicted frequently in cartoons and comedic television shows, but Muhammad is almost always censored in depictions.

News Talks about…News—Not Ancient History

The reason that Islamic violence dominates the headlines today is because it happens now. News is about timeliness. The Spanish Inquisitions of centuries past were barbaric. Historian Henry Kamen estimates that 40,000 Jews were forced into exile because of the persecution, and up to 5,000 people are thought to have been executed, according to various sources. The Inquisition targeted Muslims, as well.

This is ‘debateophobia’—’fear of a free and frank discussion.”

That’s why the Inquisitors were feared at the time and why the Black Legend, a fearful reading of Spanish history, was so powerful. Some early scholarship may have posited death tolls that were higher than the true total, but even if the death toll was in the thousands and not the hundred thousands, it was still an egregious moral wrong that the whole population was denied religious freedoms and that thousands were tortured and executed.

The first response to the Inquisition should not be “Catholicism Faces Rising Tide of Bigotry” any more than the first response to the murder of journalists should be “France Faces Rising Tide of Islamophobia.” It also faces a rising tide of terrorism, which is the starting point for any broader discussion. But that was one of the headlines that ran in the Telegraph in the 48 hours after the attack. If everything must be a “-phobia”, then this is “debateophobia”—“fear of a free and frank discussion,” as sociology professor Frank Furedi called it—to condemn any attempt at understanding the underlying motivations of our current terrorists.

If those liberals who spent the past two days condemning the inquisitions truly believe forced conversions and state-backed murders are so bad, here is something they can resist now. As the Islamic State ravages Iraq and Syria, already having killed more in two years than the Spanish Inquisition killed in its entirety, including thousands of Muslims on the basis of their religious views, it won’t do the victims any good to tell them, “Centuries ago, Christians were also violent.” They are more concerned about surviving today. We should share their concerns.

Meet The Hypocrites Who Did Attend The Paris Unity Rally,"Much has been made about the absence of President Obama, and any significant U.S. official, at the Paris Unity Rally Sunday in reaction to the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack. Considering the cause of the march, equal attention is worth paying to those who did attend.

While a line of prominent officials from countries around the world leading a legion of thousands through the streets of Paris in a show of “unity” makes for an evocative image, it shouldn’t go without a reminder that many of those same countries would prosecute the slain editors for the very cartoons over which they were murdered.

Journalists around the world have decried the Charlie Hebdo massacre as an attack on free speech. But free-speech laws, at least as Americans understand them, do not merely reserve one’s right to offend. They guarantee the citizenry’s protection from government persecution for voicing opinions critical of or contrary to the government’s actions. While there are general limits (shouting “fire” in a crowded theater when none exists, libel, slander), opinions and provably true statements are legally protected.

In Many Nations, ‘Blasphemy’ Is a Crime

The terrorists who murdered Charlie Hebdo’s editors didn’t care about their victims’ political views. They did not want to take control of Charlie Hebdo or change its message to their own. Charlie Hebdo wasn’t attacked because they it criticized a government or libeled a living individual. This wasn’t an attempt to silence people who had different opinions or even to take revenge on behalf of the variety of beliefs Charlie Hebdo had ridiculed over the years.

This attack was not so much an attack on free speech as it was an attempt to enforce Sharia blasphemy laws.

This attack was not so much an attack on free speech as it was an attempt to enforce Sharia blasphemy laws. It was about destroying those who blasphemed “the prophet.” In that sense, the world leaders who did attend the Paris unity rally are an ironic group.

Jordan prohibits blasphemy against Islam and Muhammad, even beyond its borders. In 2008, Jordan charged Dutch politician Geert Wilders for blasphemy over his movie, “Fitna,” which linked the Koran with worldwide Islamic terrorism. Wilders was in the Netherlands, not Jordan, at the time. King Abdullah II and Queen Rania represented Jordan at the Paris rally Sunday.

The United Arab Emirates has separate civil and Sharia courts. Blasphemy is, of course, prohibited under Sharia law. One case of blasphemy prosecution involved immigrant workers, which make up a large percentage of the UAE population. In the course of a workplace dispute, three Filipinos were charged with ripping a page out of the Koran and scribbling on it. Their work permits were revoked, a precursor to deportation. Foreign Minister Sheik Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan represented UAE at the rally.

The Global Hypocrisy Didn’t End There

The state religion of Algeria is Islam, and “offending the Prophet Mohammad” is a criminal offense. In 2012, a Christian convert was tried and sentenced to five years in prison for this offense. Algeria’s Foreign Minister Ramtane Lamamra was at the unity rally in Paris.

In Egypt, seven Christians were sentenced to death for participating in the movie, ‘The Innocence of Muslims.’

Egypt has a slew of notable cases involving blasphemy against Islam. Perhaps the most recent high-profile one was in 2012, where seven Christians were sentenced to death for participating in the movie, “The Innocence of Muslims.” That same year, less famously, two boys aged 9 and 10 were arrested for “insulting Islam.” They were found near a trash pile tearing up some pages of the Koran (possibly from a copy discarded in that very trash pile). Egypt’s Foreign Minister, Sameh Shoukry, was at the unity rally on Sunday.

Turkey’s last prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, publicly advocated for international blasphemy laws specifically to protect Muslims’ sensibilities. Turkey itself already has laws in place forbidding the “denigration of religious values.” Erdoğan’s term ended in 2014, and current Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu was at the unity rally in Paris on Sunday.

Danish writer Lars Hedegaard was charged in 2011 for making critical remarks against Islam. The sentence could have been two years in prison. He was convicted, but his conviction was overturned through appeal. In 2013, he survived an assassination attempt by an Islamist. The assailant was found, but at the end of last year was released to the Islamic State as part of a prisoner swap. Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt was part of the rally on Sunday.

Tunisia’s constitution is young, but blasphemy is actively prosecuted there. In 2012, two men were sentenced to seven years in prison each for satirizing Islam and Mohammed. A court of appeals upheld their conviction. The Prime Minister of Tunisia, Mehdi Jomaa, attended the unity rally on Sunday.

With more than 40 world leaders reported as having attended the unity rally, there are certainly other examples available. As such, the Paris Unity rally—and the presence of those in attendance—can be seen as a grand gesture of grief over the slain and condolence for France, but should not be assumed to be a statement of support for the freedoms of speech and protections from persecution so many in the world took it to be.

Muslim Soccer Stars Should Lead Global Denunciation Of Terror Attacks,"Muslim spokesman and best-selling writer Reza Aslan clearly thinks Muslims have done and said more than enough to denounce violence in the wake of the January 7 attacks in Paris. He went on television to express his resentment that anyone who would suggest otherwise. “Anyone who keeps saying that we need to hear the moderate voice of Islam—why aren’t Muslims denouncing these violent attacks—doesn’t own Google.”

I risk Aslan considering me a backwards rube, then, in suggesting that moderate Muslims do in fact need to say more to help stem this ongoing tide of violence. He’s right that there have been some good forthright responses. But I’m guessing that many Aslan would include on his long list are less helpful. Some of these have been hamstrung by rigid standards of sensitivity. There’s groups like the Council on American-Islamic Relations, who play a disingenuous shell-game to their benefit, calibrating their rhetoric about violence depending on their audience. Some criticisms of the attacks equivocated even as they criticized. “Yes, the attacks were awful, but…” These people urge us to move on from Paris and focus on Israel and Syria.

How to Reach the Banlieues?

Beyond this, there’s this key question: Whose voices will actually be heard by impressionable young Muslims, like the killers in Paris who grew up in isolated banlieues on the outskirts of French cities? It seems that many young people radicalized in recent years have been influenced not by imams and formal religious channels, but by a mish-mash of global pop culture influences. In a hair-splitting way, then, it’s fair to say that the fruit of this radicalization process is not Islamic per se. The problem is that the perpetrators over and over again believe it to be so.

More than politicians, clerics, and writers, young people in Europe of all races, ethnicities, and religions follow sports stars.

So whose voices might be heard by young Muslims—in France, throughout Europe, and around the world? More than politicians, clerics, and writers, young people in Europe of all races, ethnicities, and religions follow sports stars. If anything, the trend is more focused in Europe than America. Here, football, basketball, and baseball compete for allegiance. In Europe and most of the world, it’s all football (or soccer, if you will) all the time. The top footballers playing in Europe have a global celebrity power and pull that few others can match. And, since the 1990s, more and more of these footballers have been Muslims. Football—the world’s most popular sport—has been transformed by the involvement of Muslim players.

Realizing this (and being a football fan myself), I started looking hopefully for statements by Muslim footballers following the Charlie Hebdo attacks. I used Google searches (I promise I know how these work), Twitter, and Facebook. But day after day, my searches came up largely empty with a few revealing exceptions. Aslan aside, it seems not all voices have been heard from.

French football did respond collectively. The top French league marked the occasion with appropriately somber ceremonies. The slate of matches following the Charlie Hebdo attacks observed a moment of silence and saw players wearing black armbands. Some players went further, wearing warmup shirts bearing the “Je suis Charlie” slogan seen at the massive January 11 unity rally in Paris showcasing French solidarity.

Like moments of silence, unity marches are heart-warming, but not necessarily convincing or long-lasting. They run the risk of being short-lived Kumbaya moments in part because they’re such a commonplace feature of our contemporary culture. They appeal to sentiment rather than belief, so are less likely to offend. In the aftermath of recent attacks, we need more than this. Forthright statements of disavowal need to accompany displays of solidarity. Unfortunately, there’s been no statement along these lines from any Muslim footballer on record.

Among Muslim Football Stars, a Pattern of Silence

Among those who’ve remained silent are football stars Franck Ribéry, Karim Benzema, and Samir Nasri—each of whom is a Muslim and Frenchman who’s played for the national team. So too the retired Zinedine Zidane, who even now enjoys a star power beyond that of most athletes around the world. He earned this status in part as the star of the 1998 World Cup, which saw France’s multi-racial and enormously talented “rainbow team” win the final and raise the trophy. Zidane’s roots are in Algeria, from where his parents migrated to France before he was born. Around the world, no athlete’s shirt has been cherished by more fans than Zidane’s. Notably, this Muslim global mega-star, too, has said nothing in the wake of Charlie Hebdo attacks.

These players have roles as cultural ambassadors for both their European football clubs and for Islam.

Some might say (and perhaps these players are thinking) that their job is not to get involved in politics or religion, but simply to help their team win trophies. That’s true to a point, yet it doesn’t take account of their roles as cultural ambassadors for both their European football clubs and for Islam. Many European clubs have been increasing interest in Islamic issues. Some have shown their sensitivity by building separate showers, reserving space for prayer, and changing practices involving alcohol. Bayern Munich is currently constructing a masjid for Muslim players, which will eventually include an Islamic library and full-time imam.

Although racism continues to plague some corners of European football, there’s relatively little opposition to Muslim players specifically. On a couple of clubs, older Muslim players even play a grandfatherly role, and are looked up to by younger teammates—Muslim or not. English children playing football in parks are seen emulating the motions of the Muslim prayer ritual of some of their favorite players who happen to be Muslims—without necessarily understanding these. All this speaks to the wide-ranging effects of multiculturalism in European football among other areas of society.

Is Multiculturalism a One-Way Street?

But is multiculturalism just a one-way street? That’s how it’s often understood—that Europeans should learn about things like Muslim food ways, clothing, religious practices, and values. This is certainly happening, partly due to growing role of celebrity Muslim footballers playing on clubs throughout Europe. But a full multiculturalism would send influence in both directions. It would see Muslim emigrants to Europe, particularly successful ones like professional footballers, come to appreciate and support things like individual freedoms and toleration.

Only two Muslim footballers have spoken publicly of their opposition to the killings in Paris.

According to media outlets, Muslim footballers have communicated almost none of this since January 7. In fact, only two Muslim footballers have spoken publicly of their opposition to the killings in Paris. Ivorian Yaya Touré, who plays in England, spoke to a reporter a few days after the attacks, but appeared ill at ease doing so. He said he felt sorry for the families of the slain and said that people should be free to “say what they want to say,” but quickly followed up saying that Charlie Hebdo was “trying to do too much, and sometimes they do it not with respect” in their depictions of Muhammad. He also tried to shift the narrative away from the actions of Muslims to non-Muslims’ views of Islam, saying that Muslims now feared reprisals.

Lilian Thuram went further. A native of Guadeloupe, Thuram moved to France as a boy. There he experienced racism, but also developed quickly as a footballer. Eventually, he enjoyed a legendary career for club and country as he joined Zidane on France’s World Cup-winning 1998 national team. Thuram was out of the country at the time of the attacks, but when he learned about them and the unity rally planned, he rushed back to France to participate. “It’s vital that we support the victims and that we don’t sink into fear. To defend society we need to build solidarity,” he explained. Thuram has spent time following his retirement on anti-racism campaigns, and sees similar work needing to be done among young Muslims in France.

There’s One Notable Exception to This Trend

However, the honor for the strongest response by a European footballer to the January 7 killings belongs to Vincent Kompany. There’s a catch, though—he’s not Muslim. Kompany is the son of a Congolese father and Belgian mother, who plays for Belgium’s national team and for a club in England. Like many other star athletes today, Kompany maintains an active presence on social media. Just hours after the Charlie Hebdo attacks, he posted a message to both his Twitter and Facebook page: “La Kalashnikov peut réduire l’individu au silence, le peuple en revanche lui devient plus bruyant. Liberté d’expression! #JeSuisCharlie.” Or in English: “The Kalashnikov silences the individual, but emboldens the masses. Freedom of expression!”

It’s a remarkable and so far unique response to the attacks. Kompany went beyond solidarity to succinctly express his commitment to freedom of expression, pluralism, and toleration. This message is exactly what’s needed today, and it received many likes on Facebook (including mine).

But Kompany’s short statement angered and shocked many of his fans. Some critics said he was focusing too much on freedom of expression and not enough on respect for Muslims. Some urged Kompany to focus his criticism on the actions of Israel and western nations involved in Syria. (“I am not Charlie. I am Palestinian who is being stolen. I am Syria who is being bombed.”) Some questioned his African identity, suggesting he’s a sell-out. (“You should be ashamed of being a slave of white people.” “You worship the white man.”) And some critics told Kompany that he was missing the real story behind the Charlie Hebdo attacks. These respondents were among those who have marked up grainy photos online and claimed that the Charlie Hebdo attack was a Jewish conspiracy orchestrated by Mossad.

These angry responses to Kompany show us why sadly he stood alone among fellow celebrity footballers in his position. They show that humanitarianism–which is always a fragile thing–risks being suffocated by post-colonialist frustrations, aggrieved feelings of disrespect, and deep-rooted anti-Semitism. There are other hopeful exceptions to this concerning pattern, especially the slain Muslim policeman Ahmed Merabets, whose family spoke eloquently after his death, and Lassana Bathilys, the Muslim man who hid Jewish shoppers at the kosher supermarket from the gunman trying to hunt them down. But more humanitarian voices with star power like footballers would help even more. I hope Kompany is right—that the bloodthirsty attacks in Paris will embolden the masses to unequivocally denounce violence and intolerance. But I’d be further encouraged if more of his footballing colleagues, especially Muslims, would join him in this vital project.

Six Elements That Make For A Quality Survival Horror Game,"Editor’s note: Several of the embedded screen captures contain graphic themes and images.

It’s no secret that the quantity and quality of the horror genre in video games has been dwindling since the advent of the seventh console generation, with a few bright spots in an otherwise bleak terrain of drudgery. There seems to be a misconception that horror games don’t sell well, but that’s because they’ve strayed from what makes the genre unique—and this has turned off the audience that originally supported the games. Developers and publishers also have lofty expectations when it comes to sales, wanting every game to sell like the industry behemoths, “Call of Duty” or “Grand Theft Auto.”

Here are some pointers on what makes a quality horror game when applied effectively: disempowerment, isolation, tension, uncertainty, lingering fear, and an unbalanced, imperfect, relatable protagonist.

1. Horror Games Need Disempowerment

Video games are all about interaction—how to engage characters, enemies, and the environment. The most common interaction (and the most popular) is with an enemy. A large draw in gaming is empowerment: putting yourself into a position in which you’re stronger than you are in real life. Horror games aren’t about that. They’re about taking away a player’s power in the face of danger. They’re about fear.

There are two effective ways to do this. The first and most obvious is the complete removal of any combat. It is horrifying to face a potential threat and have no option but to run and hide. Games like “Amnesia,” “Outlast,” and “Slender” do this well.

“Amnesia: The Dark Descent-PC”



They make the player vulnerable, exposed, and often helpless. Anyone who played hide-and-seek as a child understands the thrill of being hunted and barely escaping. It’s truly frightening when in a game you have to run from a gruesome monster or hide in a closet while it stalks you, lingering at the crack in the door. This is pure disempowerment.

A second way to disempower players is by providing tools they can use to defend themselves but then leaving them vulnerable, without any help. Games like “Resident Evil” and “Silent Hill” do this effectively.

“Silent Hill 2 Gameplay-PS2”



The protagonist may have a gun or a bat, and in many games these would be sufficient to mow down hordes of enemies, but in a good horror game, these weapons are just enough to survive one or maybe a handful of encounters. In horror games, having a tool gives you hope, only to realize that even with a loaded handgun, those zombies are going to keep coming.

Game designers need to regulate this tactic, though, because giving the player access to too many weapons, or too powerful ones, dissipates fear. “Silent Hill Homecoming” was met with some criticism because its combat mechanics were actually too good. The player could dodge and weave while applying effective melee attacks to otherwise deadly creatures.

That is a major problem with some current horror games: too much ammo and enemies that are too weak. Developers are afraid that players will put the game down if they can’t fight back easily. This is apparent in “Resident Evil” 5 and 6, where much of the horror and fear dissipate because the player can kill not-zombies while busting every wooden crate to refill five guns. The original “Resident Evil” games (1-3) balanced the available weaponry with enemy placement and ammo scarcity. Running around a mansion with a rocket launcher is no horror experience, but having a shotgun with two rounds and an unknown number of creatures is.

2. Horror Games Need Isolation

As human beings, we seek community, guidance, and help from others. We come into this world connected to other people, and grow up depending on them. It takes years for us to truly function without another individual, but we still need people and find comfort in the presence of others. When we’re isolated, it’s natural to feel scared. Horror games capitalize on this by putting players in situations where they’re alone.

Having to explore a quiet town or a mental hospital by yourself is a typical horror scenario. Just being alone in an environment, hearing only the wind or the rustling of leaves or other more ominous sounds is creepy. Games use this tactic even better when they show you that it’s possible for you to be with others, but a certain situation prevents this. “Dead Space” is a game of isolation that sometimes shows other characters trying to interact with you from far away or behind thick glass. You are still alone, and it’s painful and frustrating to see the potential of safety with others.

“Dead Space 1 Gameplay-PS3/Xbox360”



A large problem with modern horror games is the inclusion of cooperative gameplay. Games like “Resident Evil 5” and “Dead Space 3” sap the horror from a game by adding another character (or potential player) to the mix. An experience is radically less scary with another person by your side. Imagine being in your favorite horror movie alone, then imagine it with a friend; it’s not the same experience at all. In games, the partners are either too unrealistic, meaning you never have to worry about their safety, or they are incompetent, taking your ammo and health items and just getting in the way. Situations like these kill horror games. Publishers have even demanded multiplayer additions to some horror games, which completely undermines the horror experience and game’s attraction. In online play, even in mob mode, playing with or against others is not scary. Isolation is an effective and easy method to create a horror game atmosphere.

3. Horror Games Need Tension

Tension in video games is derived from mental or emotional strain. Horror games must have tension to be successful; you can’t have your player comfortable or confident as he or she plays through the game. Tension is achieved in a variety of ways. The first comes from the disempowerment aspect: resource management. Nothing is more stressful than having one bullet in your gun and untold numbers of beasts lingering around a building. Having to scour an area for items that can defend yourself adds to the tension of a game. It also puts players in positions of agency: “Do I explore that room? I only have one bullet and there could be ammo, or there could be a monster that takes more than one bullet to kill.”

Good horror games force you to manage your available items, having to dump or store health plants or lighter fluid so you can carry extra ammo, or holding this quest item by putting down that axe.

Finding resources adds tension in the game, but keeping them does as well. Good horror games force you to manage your available items, having to dump or store health plants or lighter fluid so you can carry extra ammo, or holding this quest item by putting down that axe. “Silent Hill: Origins” does this poorly because it allows you to carry an unlimited number of items; you can carry 12 portable TVs to bash things with, only to have the object break in one hit. “Resident Evil 1,” on the other hand, does this well, giving you a storage area along with a save machine that you can return to, but this means you can have only a certain number of items.

When it comes to saving, a real consequence of gaming is real-world time. We can’t complete a game all in one sitting most of the time, so we need a mechanism of saving our progress. Horror games use this potential stressor well. In many games, when you die or fail, all your progress after the last save point is lost, kind of like backing up data in a computer before a crash. Having to balance a protagonist’s life on top of a real-world consequence of lost time adds even more tension that many games outside of horror use.

Video games are about interactivity, but they borrow sound and light from the film medium. Visual lighting effects can make a horror game shine (literally). Placing shadows in just the right places can create some terrifying situations for a player, adding tension to the game. In “Resident Evil 1,” there is a stretch of windows to the player’s left with light filtering through to create a gray haze. Due to the camera constraints, you can’t clearly see out of the windows. While you are walking past the windows, among the shadows is a zombie, quietly tapping the glass. This shadow can be easily missed, but observant players can be freaked out by the subtle revelation.

Sound design is equally important, and a fine example of this is the original “Dead Space.” The principal enemies in these games are necromorphs, mutated space zombies who crawl through a derelict ship using the ventilation shafts.

“Dead Space Sound and Gameplay-PS3/Xbox360”



As you move alone through silent corridors, vents rattle above you, creating truly incontinence-inducing moments for many players. These sounds don’t always signal an enemy encounter, so you are never sure if you’re safe.

A major set of tension-building mechanics in horror games is actually taken from other genres, and this is the use of puzzles. Horror games like “Silent Hill” and “Resident Evil” use puzzles to force players to deal with mental strain on top of the fear building around them. Many of these puzzles require item use, squandering precious inventory space. Puzzles also force players to backtrack through previous areas they thought were safe, increasing frustration and causing them to feel helpless. Puzzles prey on a player’s desire to progress and escape challenges, which is perfect for building tension in a horror game.

4. Horror Games Need Uncertainty

If knowledge is power, then a lack of knowledge is weakness. This why we’re afraid of the dark. It’s not darkness itself that we’re afraid of, but fear of what could be in the dark. In essence, your mind becomes your greatest enemy. A common theme in successful horror games is just that: keeping players “in the dark” by forcing them to imagine what the horror is. No matter how scary a monster is, your mind can make it scarier; that’s why good horror games don’t immediately throw the enemy right at you or explain to you what it is.

A huge draw of the “Silent Hill” franchise is the uncertainty of what everything is, what those creatures are, what this place is, and even who the main character is.

“Silent Hill 3 Atmosphere and Sound-PS2”



Uncertainty plagues your mind with fear—seeing a quick passing image in your periphery, a tentacle pulling back into the water, a snarl in the distance. These fleeting images build up a horror game, adding to uncertainty. Showing the monster, then explaining it with loaded exposition, is a huge shortcoming because it empowers you with knowledge. Not knowing heightens your sense of vulnerability and adds to fear. “Resident Evil 6” does this poorly, with weak monster introductions followed by an over-the-top spectacle of a boss fight.

Players need to be drawn into danger, not have it shoved in their faces at the very beginning of the game. It’s best to keep them guessing and on the edge of their seats. The unknown is the most frightening. There are exceptions to this, of course—in horror game sequels or games with known monsters. “Alien Isolation,” for example, features a creature we’ve known about since the late 1970s (from the movie “Alien”). It was a tall order for the game to introduce the main antagonist while still being frightening—and it did just that. Cowering defenseless under a desk, you are introduced to the alien for the first time in the game; it slowly lowers itself from an air duct, draping its tail unknowingly over you. Then it moves off in the direction of your next destination.

“Alien Isolation; Alien Introduction-PS4”



The game shows us the creature at the very beginning because we already know what it is, but the game reminds us why it is frightening and how we are powerless against it. The game then hides it from us. We know just enough about it to scare us with what it can do, but the player doesn’t always know its location and what it will do at any given moment. Even main enemy types, such as the archetypical zombie, benefit from this treatment—hearing a groan from a hallway of doors and not knowing which one it came from.

A unique use of the uncertainty tactic was in the “Resident Evil” remake on the GameCube. The developers added a new mechanic that forced players to burn a zombie’s body after death, so it wouldn’t rise up again with red skin and claws, bearing twice the speed and health. The problem was that players needed matches and kerosene, both limited resources. In addition, the zombies would reanimate at random times, so it was dangerous to leave a body to get fire.

Current “Resident Evil” games lack this mechanic or anything of similar effectiveness. A new game, “The Evil Within,” does make use of this, with many enemies feigning death on the ground only to rise up and attack you, yet allowing you a quick chance to burn them on the ground while vulnerable. The uncertainty aspect is a must in horror games, because knowledge of a player’s environment, enemies, or even other characters empowers the gamer.

5. Horror Games Need Lingering Fear

The best horror fiction puts something into the mind of the one experiencing it, something that stays with you after you’ve put down the controller or closed the book. Most people who saw the movie “Jaws” for the first time experienced a lingering fear of sharks, their mind straying to bloody attacks as they tried to enjoy the tranquility of the ocean. It’s a fear that remains with you long after you’ve watched the movie. Great horror games don’t stop scaring you after you’re done playing; the fear lingers until you can finally purge it.

A great horror game is about psychology, exploring what it means to be human and the hard truths about mankind’s flaws.

A great horror game is about psychology, exploring what it means to be human and the hard truths about mankind’s flaws. Psychological horror is central to these games when done well. In many cases, the game explores how humanity is the monster, causing you to reflect on yourself and others after you’ve turned off the console. Games like “Resident Evil” show that, despite all the horrific creatures spawned out of Umbrella Corp, the people making these things are just as, if not crueler, than the monsters.

A common horror trope is to have survivors of an apocalypse turn out to be the real monsters. Games like “The Last of Us” pit players against transformed fungal mutants, who attack on instinct, and the surviving humans, who actively and willfully pillage, rape, and kill. This leads us to the question: Who are the real monsters? What is real evil—those who act on instinct or by choice?

In “The Last of Us,” the mutants, while seemingly mindless, were once humans whose brains were shut down by a fungal infection. While sneaking through the game, you see some of them standing still, weeping and moaning. Are these people trapped in their own minds and, every once in a while, their memories surface and they’re overwhelmed by the grotesque reality of what they’ve become? They aren’t technically zombies; they’re still alive—and maybe still human. This causes anxiety in players as they reflect on the possibility that they are killing people who might be silently screaming in their minds for help, horrified by their inability to stop their own attacks.

“The Last of Us; Infected-PS3”



Horror games can also focus on displaying the monstrosity of a particular character. In games like “Silent Hill,” the environment reflects psychological and emotional conflicts and weaknesses. The characters in “Silent Hill” are often normal people with struggles and fears, but their psyches unravel. Seeing what happens to them can cause the gamer to wonder what could happen in his or her own Silent Hill.

Developers build the enemies and environments to be metaphors for the main character. In “Silent Hill Downpour,” the main character has been in prison, so certain parts of the game are created with linearity and confinement to represent the character’s imprisoned life. The final part of the game is actually a prison-like area, paralleling life in the cell.

“Silent Hill Downpour-Xbox360”



The connection between the environment and characters’ inner struggles bring you into their world, causing you to reflect on how your own environment would transform if your psyche were projected onto it. What would the world look like if your stress, anxieties, and fears were made manifest? That is a truly frightening thought!

Horror games can also evoke thoughts about humanity’s frailty and finitude. “Call of Cthulhu,” a game based on the “Lovecraft” horror story of the same name, pits humanity against a being of unimaginable scope and power. It puts into perspective the smallness of players in their own world, how they’re just dust when faced with a great and powerful malevolence. It helps gamers to immerse themselves in the game and be thoughtful about the deeper meaning behind the gameplay and writing. When a good horror game uses lingering fear on a gamer in this way, the outcome is spectacular.

6. Provide An Unbalanced, Imperfect, Relatable Protagonist

The term unbalanced in gaming usually refers to gameplay, attacks being overpowered or underpowered, enemies being too few or too numerous, etc. What we mean by an unbalanced protagonist is one that from a technical standpoint would be considered weak and fragile in the gaming environment. From a good horror developer’s perspective, this is balanced. The main character in a horror game shouldn’t be overly powered, which removes believability and kills tension. It’s beneficial for the protagonist to be ill-equipped, without having fighting experience or useful knowledge.

Putting the player at a disadvantage in a horror game is a good start, and the character needs to be vulnerable in some way. The protagonist should also be imperfect. Having flaws is intrinsically human and allows us to relate to the character. Think of AMC’s “The Walking Dead.” One of the appeals of the show is how imperfect all the characters are. This makes us feel for them and emotionally invest in their plight. When we empathize with a character, we are much more affected when he or she is in danger. Seeing James Sunderland in “Silent Hill 2,” a normal man, neither good nor bad, not built or ready for battle, having to deal with the monsters of “Silent Hill,” is much more frightening because we relate to him and subconsciously see our own fragility in the character. He has also suffered the death of a loved one—something that can draw empathy from many players, which brings greater depth of feeling to the game.

James also confronts a physical manifestation of his sexual aggression, the Pyramid Head, something some players might relate to in their own private lives.

“Pyramid Head Encounters; Silent Hill 2-PS2”



When gamers encounter things like this in horror games, the fear is more real because they can relate to it. In a sense, horror protagonists need to be more realistic, they need to represent the flawed nature of humanity. In terms of gameplay, the stiff mechanics of the “Silent Hill” combat in the first four entries were enjoyable. The game felt more real, because you were not literally controlling the character muscle for muscle. The combat encounters were always a struggle, and they never felt okay or safe. “Resident Evil,” with its infamous tank controls, allows the player to feel the anxiety of the limited control scheme. The characters feel restricted and, therefore, more realistic and human.

Horror games do well to create characters rather than blank slates. A horror game protagonist needs to be written and have established strengths and weaknesses, effectively enriching the game’s potential. A game featuring a blank character who literally is the player (like those made in massively multiplayer online character creators at the beginning of the game) either plays to the most general aspects of humanity, which creates stale and cookie-cutter horror games, or forces the game to anticipate all the different aspects of any player, which is impossible. The protagonist of “The Evil Within,” Sebastian, for example, is too bland and uninteresting. He often makes seemingly normal remarks in completely insane situations. Horror characters need to be aware of their own fears and their weaknesses, so players can be aware of their own fears and weaknesses, too.

The Appeal of Horror Games

Carl Jung wrote, “Knowing your own darkness is the best method for dealing with the darknesses of other people.” He was speaking more generally about all the hidden aspects of our psyches—all those shadows we’ve yet to shed light on about ourselves. Some of those can be positive and good, but some are negative and deeply troubling.

We come to a better understanding of ourselves and other people when we get to know our shadows and give them form.

“Everyone carries a shadow,” he wrote, “and the less it is embodied in the individual’s conscious life, the blacker and denser it will be.” When we bring to light our inner demons or those elusive unknowns about ourselves, we are better equipped to overcome them and not allow them seep into our conscious lives in destructive ways. We come to a better understanding of ourselves and other people when we get to know our shadows and give them form. This is part of the appeal of the horror genre (when it is done well), as we explore in a safe, hyperbolic, and even ridiculous way, the shadows that create anxiety and fear.

Another part is the element of Aristotelian catharsis as it relates to tragedy, which arouses pity and fear. Watching and engaging in tragedy or even horror allows you to release the inner terrors you see displayed before you in a benign form. Tragic catharsis is a kind of purging, as you release the fear that feeds anxiety and poisons your life. Horror games can help redirect our psychological fears onto something externally terrifying, allowing us to face them and lessen their power over us.

Mostly, horror games satisfy the thrill that comes with fear. Think of the game of hide-and-seek” again. We get an adrenaline rush that comes from being startled or afraid. We get this in all kinds of ways—jumping out of airplanes, zip-lining, riding on roller coasters, whitewater rafting, bungee jumping. Of course, this rush can become addictive, but in moderation, it can serve as a healthy purging of dark emotions.

Horror films and games aren’t for everyone, just as boxing, sports, and tear-jerker tragedies (which also have a vicarious element) don’t appeal to all of us. But for those who do enjoy the horror genre, gaming can be a prime medium because its interactivity heightens the sense of fear, allowing for greater cathartic release. Again, when played in moderation, it can be a fun and enlightening journey—but only when the games have all the elements that make a horror game truly worth playing.

How Press Attacks On GOP 2016 Contenders Could Backfire,"The next presidential election is more than a year away, but news reporters are pummeling GOP presidential hopefuls like Rocky taking on a freezer full of meat.

The attacks could work against the Scott Walkers and Jeb Bushes of the party, but they also leave the press vulnerable to months of assaults on its integrity. The latter appears more likely thanks to conservatives hammering guilty reporters on social media. Their message is clear: this isn’t 2012 or 2008.

Just do a Twitter search on #ObamaLovesAmerica and you’ll be inundated with snarky and sober comments from the Right. It’s only a fraction of the blowback heading towards reporters who are all too eager to take out a GOP contender.

Conservative media outlets like National Review and Breitbart News are underlining the bias, but they aren’t alone. Conservatives are sharing their news stories, cranking up comic memes based on the hopelessly biased reportage, and peppering via Twitter reporters who unfairly target the GOP. In short, they’re revealing media organs like The Washington Post for what they appear to be, the Ready for Hillary campaign’s not-so-secret weapon.

Scott Walker, Social Media Warrior

And the initial GOP frontrunner, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, leads their efforts. In true Andrew Breitbart fashion, Walker is calling out media outlets for their gotcha queries.

Few reporters feel curious enough to so much as type ‘Obama AND college’ into Google.

Such press attacks on the GOP are the kind rarely visited on Democrats. The Washington Post conducted a thorough, and utterly nitpicky, examination of Walker’s college years. Time magazine went so far as to interview the governor’s former high-school teacher for some gotcha gold.

Those very same outlets couldn’t be bothered to dig into President Obama’s college records, then or now. They are sealed and likely will remain so since few reporters feel curious enough to so much as type “Obama AND college” into Google. Or Bing.

So what did Team Walker do in response to the academic attacks? It started raising money off the obvious bias:

‘When you have a record like President Obama and the Democrats’, the last thing you want to talk about are results. That is why their defenders in the mainstream media love to distract the public,’ the email said.

Over the weekend, conservatives pounced when Jezebel published a story accusing Walker of stopping sexual assaults at the University of Wisconsin from being reported to the government. It was the War on Women 2.0—or perhaps 8.0., given how often the tactic is used against conservatives. The Daily Beast quickly picked up the story, magnifying its reach and clout.

Except the story was a lie. Walker was simply responding to a university request. It was already reporting these statistics to the government, so duplicating that effort wasted time and resources.

Conservatives let the Jezebel story’s author, Natasha Vargas-Cooper, have it on Twitter for not doing a Google search for context. Vargas-Cooper initially fired back in a defiant tone. The sheer volume of Tweets mocking her fallacious story convinced her to lock her Twitter account.

The Right Swings Back

We learned this week that Jeb Bush’s wife is prone to spending some of the couple’s considerable wealth. Where is that fainting couch when we need it? Breitbart News’ John Nolte shredded The Washington Post’s Karen Tumulty in true Jon Stewart fashion for co-authoring the Bush wife story.

Nolte wasn’t alone in publicly pressuring Tumulty. He got a hand from others on social media, and after getting a cyber smackdown Tumulty threw up her hands and said, “I’ve got work to do.”

Consider the plight of poor Ron Fournier. The veteran scribe at National Journal faced the brunt of conservative ire earlier this month. He sent out the following tweet to share a withering New York Times column on Walker’s school-based rulings.

Welcome to the Big Time, @ScottWalker. This is @nytimescollins; she’ll be keeping you real: http://t.co/tiTREpzOwq



— Ron Fournier (@ron_fournier) February 14, 2015

Only the column in question blamed Walker for something that had happened before he actually became governor. At least Fournier apologized both for the column’s epic mistake and his tweet’s haughty tone. That wouldn’t have happened, most likely, without conservatives pressuring him via Twitter.

Social Media Reduces the Press’s Power

Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani recently described President Obama in ways that mirror the fiery rhetoric far too many top Democrats employ. He said the president doesn’t love his own country, in so many words. Salivating reporters rushed to Walker for his reaction to Giuliani’s comments, a tactic they rarely use when a Democrat makes a controversial statement. When the popular governor essentially shrugged his shoulders, those very same reporters went into a frenzy.

A single, perfectly calibrated tweet has as much clout as a New York Times headline, sometimes even more.

This is the same supine press that couldn’t wait to ignore the fact that Obama worshipped in a church led by a spiritual leader who seethed with hatred for America. Remember when CNN proudly declared that an interview with Obama at the height of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright controversy would be a “Wright-free zone”? And does anyone recall the media frenzy after Obama called President George W. Bush “unpatriotic” during the 2008 campaign?

Me either.

That’s textbook liberal media bias. Ignore the incendiary comments from the Left and use those from the Right as a cudgel against their party. That almost never happens after Gov. Howard Dean shouts his latest questionable comment or Vice President Joe Biden paws another unsuspecting female.

We live a time when random folks on Twitter are funnier than the host of the Academy Awards telecast. A single, perfectly calibrated tweet has as much clout as a New York Times headline, sometimes even more with enough “shares,” “likes,” and “retweets.”

Every year new media outlets grow stronger, bolder, and more influential. And every year the public’s trust in the mainstream media slips. We’re not at a tipping point yet, a time when people greet MSM spin for what it is. But it’s getting closer.

Conservatives simply want a more equitable media playing field to greet the next presidential race. Let the best candidate win, not the one favored by a fawning press.

Let’s Call Islamic Terrorists What They Call Themselves,"For more than three decades, they have sought out and killed Americans. In 1983, in one of the first major anti-American attacks, they bombed the Marine barracks in Beirut, killing 241 American servicemen. In 1992, they used bombs to kill two people in Aden, Yemen, in hopes of killing American troops that might be passing through. In February 1993, they used a truck-based explosive to try and topple the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan. They failed, but their attack killed six New Yorkers and injured a thousand others.

What would you call the perpetrators of such acts—militants? Would you copy President Obama and call them violent extremists or simply terrorists? What is missing in such formulations? Even as he identified al-Qaeda as a threat to America, Obama refused to describe the enemy as it describes itself: “Islamic.”

Islamic Terrorists Have a Religious Goal

Emboldened by their success in Beirut and their almost-success in New York City in 1993, terrorists used bombs in 1995 to kill five U.S. servicemen in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The following year, al-Qadea struck again at American troops in Saudi Arabia in the Khobar Tower bombings, killing 19 Americans and wounding 372.

Why did the terrorists persist in their plots to kill Americans? What was it about America that so enraged them? In February 1998, Osama Bin Laden provided an answer when he declared a “fatwa” (a religious decree) declaring war against America in the name of the World Islamic Front, calling for the killing of civilians as well as soldiers:

The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies — civilians and military — is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country [emphasis added] in which it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the al-Aqsa Mosque and the holy mosque [Mecca] from their grip, and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim.

By their own words, Bin Laden and his fellow travelers declared themselves to be not just terrorists but Islamist terrorists with a religious goal—to re-establish true Islamic society in the Middle East by removing any “stain” of American influence by force. Bin Laden believed the whole world was meant to accept his universal message.

While the majority of Muslims prefer peaceful, non-violent, socio-political approaches that lead in time to a peaceful transition to Islamic society, a minority, led by revolutionary groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS, favor a jihad or holy war dependent upon violence and military action. This brand of Salafist Islam does not distinguish between combatants and civilians as the West does but sees the West as an imperialist enemy with America as its leader.

It is self-evident that the terrorists who have sought to kill us all these years are Islamist. Al-Qaeda and ISIS terrorists consider themselves to be holy warriors who believe in a specific ideology (Islamist extremism) that is tied to a specific religion: Islam.

From Al-Qaeda to ISIS

Following Bin Laden’s fatwa, the killing continued. In January 2000, al-Qaeda attacked the USS Cole in the port of Aden, killing 17 and injuring 39 Americans. In the world today, Bin Laden said, “the worst terrorists are the Americans,” and he predicted “a black future for America.” We did not understand how black they would try to make it.

While President Obama acknowledged that the fight against al-Qaeda was not over, neither he nor any other Western leader foresaw the change that Islamist terrorism would undergo.

On the morning of September 11, 2001, two hijacked passenger jets smashed into New York City’s World Trade Center, destroying the two towers and killing 2,753 people. A third hijacked jet slammed into the side of the Pentagon in Washington DC, killing 184 civilians and military personnel. A fourth plane, whose target was probably the U.S. Capitol, was diverted by courageous passengers and crashed in the Pennsylvania countryside, killing 33 passengers, seven crew, and four hijackers.

In response, President George W. Bush approved and later President Barack Obama supported a global manhunt for Bin Laden, which ended on May 1, 2011, in Abbottabad, Pakistan, with his death in a raid by American Navy SEALs. Commented President Obama: “For over two decades, bin Laden has been al-Qaeda’s leader and symbol, and has continued to plot attacks against our country and our friends and allies. The death of Bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation’s effort to defeat al-Qaeda.”

While President Obama acknowledged that the fight against al-Qaeda was not over, neither he nor any other Western leader foresaw the change that Islamist terrorism would undergo.

As the central branch of al-Qaeda withered under American assault, a regional affiliate, known as al-Qaeda in Iraq or AQI, grew and spread. In 2013, this group rebranded itself as ISIS, or the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. ISIS’s mission was to do more than harass American troops with improvised explosive devices or commit acts of terror. Rather, it aspired to territorial government and expansion across the Muslim world in the name of Sunni Islam. ISIS has proclaimed itself to be a re-establishment of the caliphate, or transnational Islamist state that ruled the Middle East and much of Europe a thousand years ago.

Beheadings and Massacres: Yes, They’re Serious

It shocked the world by beheading on camera James Foley, a freelance reporter with the GlobalPost; former Army Ranger Peter Kassig; and freelance journalist Steven Sotloff. In addition, ISIS hostage Kayla Mueller, an American volunteer worker in Syria, was accidentally killed by a coalition airstrike.

Islamist terrorism will only be defeated when we see it is as far more than mindless violence and ‘extremism.’

While the West condemned the callousness of the beheadings, ISIS’s reach grew. “We announce our allegiance to the Caliph…and will hear and obey in times of difficulty and prosperity,” announced Abubakar Shekau, leader of Boko Haram, a Nigerian terrorist group dedicated to the goals of an Islamist society that ISIS represents.

Boko Haram is merciless. In the past year, it has killed more than 10,000 people. This includes a brutal massacre of some 2,000 women, children, and elderly in the town of Baga, Nigeria. Nor is its reach limited to Nigeria. Boko Haram continues to spread havoc across parts of Niger, Cameroon, and Chad. Its declared allegiance to ISIS further demonstrates the accelerating appeal of Islamist terrorism not just in the Middle East and in Africa but around the world.

In Islamist terrorism, the United States and the West face a foe of the same ideological mold as the Soviet Union. Both communism and Islamist terrorism are threats grounded in principles deeper than geo-political or social considerations. In the 14 years since 9/11 there have been 65 separate Islamist terrorist plots or attacks on U.S. soil. Thanks to the diligence of American intelligence and security operations, few of these plots have come to fruition. However, Islamist terrorism will only be defeated when we see it is as far more than mindless violence and “extremism.”

President Obama recognizes that Islamist terrorism is a problem, sort of. Last September he declared that America would use a broad coalition to ultimately “degrade” and “destroy” ISIS. Destroy? Yes. Degrade? No. ISIS is a terrorist group, not a street gang.

President Obama’s preferred use of the euphemistic “violent extremism” to describe our enemies is problematic. The President’s desire not to offend Muslims who are not engaged in terrorism may win some points in the Muslim world but it will weaken efforts to build a broad coalition against ISIS. Furthermore, it will confuse the American public. Without clarity in language there can be no clarity in strategy.

Don’t Impose Western Values on Islamic Terrorists

Obama’s socio-economic analysis of 9/11, at the time of the tragedy, reveals an inability to see clearly on a matter of national security:

The essence of this tragedy, it seems to me, derives from a fundamental absence of empathy on the part of the attackers…. It may find expression in a particular brand of violence, and may be channeled by particular demagogues or fanatics. Most often, though, it grows out of a climate of poverty and ignorance, helplessness and despair.

But the root of the 9/11 terror attacks was not a “lack of empathy” or “poverty and ignorance.” It was an ideology of religious terrorism that Bin Laden willingly embraced. His beliefs flowed from forces more potent than the superficial categories Obama suggested. Islamist terrorism is grounded in a rigid theocratic-political view of the world. As Walter Lohman, director of Heritage’s Asian Study Center has put it, “the threat cannot be honestly separated from its religious context…. Calling the threat ‘Islamist’ allows us to distinguish friend from foe.”

There is no need for America to declare its own “fatwa” against all Muslims. Rather, we must recognize that ISIS and Al-Qaeda represent a clear and present transnational danger that calls for precise definition and decisive action. We must be willing to understand our enemy as he is, not as we might wish him to be.

4 Sketchy Things In Hillary Clinton’s Emails,"The State Department released on Friday some emails that Hillary Clinton had given them from her time as Secretary of State. The only emails the State Department had to release were the ones provided by Hillary Clinton from the secret server she used during her time as secretary, so no one should have had any expectation that these emails would provide much interesting information.

Still, there are multiple sketchy things already on display in these scrubbed emails. Here are just a few of them.

The dog that didn’t bark

In fact, perhaps the most interesting aspect of the emails is what they don’t show. Byron York astutely notes that the newly released emails contain no information relating to security in Libya the month prior to the Benghazi attacks even though Ambassador Christopher Stevens warned Clinton and other State Department officials of a growing danger there. He and three other Americans were killed on the September 11, 2012 attack. Stevens had told State officials that if an attack occurred, the U.S. wouldn’t be able to repel it.

Go back to August 2012. On the 15th of that month, U.S. security officers in Libya held an “emergency” meeting to address the very real possibility that growing violence in the area could soon target Americans. The next day, Aug. 16, Stevens sent a cable to Clinton concluding that the Americans in Libya could not defend U.S. facilities “in the event of a coordinated attack, due to limited manpower, security measures, weapons capabilities, host nation support, and the overall size of the compound.”

Clinton testified that she never saw the email on account of being too busy. York notes:

But wasn’t that Aug. 16, 2012 cable — warning of dire consequences should the existing violence in Libya target Americans — a pretty important communication?… both former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey — two busy men with pretty big jobs — testified they knew about it.

I’m not sure which is worse — Clinton truly being out to lunch regarding Benghazi security or forgetting to share the emails showing she was on top of the situation there before she destroyed them. Perhaps she simply didn’t handle this issue via email.

Our Secretary of State was Instapapering super sketchy folks

Much of the media coverage of these emails is focused on the surprisingly strong links Hillary Clinton retained to longtime family consigliere Sidney Blumenthal. The White House told Clinton that she couldn’t have Blumenthal on staff, so the amount of intelligence he was providing her has raised eyebrows, particularly considering his financial interest in the areas about which he consulted. She kept him on the Clinton Foundation staff during 2011 and 2012, at the time she circulated memos he wrote to her staff. They are super close. The New York Times has three fascinating stories looking at this angle of the emails. And again, these are just the emails Clinton decided we could look at.

But in addition to the tremendous conflicts of interest are a few other surprising tidbits. Such as that Hillary Clinton is a Max Blumenthal fan who shares his work.

I’d love to know why “from” and “to” information is redacted there, but the link is to a site that is currently not available. Using the Wayback Machine, I found it here. We should perhaps pause to note that Max Blumenthal is Sidney Blumenthal’s son. And no man should necessarily be blamed for another’s errors, even if that other man is his son. But Sidney Blumenthal is a proud papa to Max, having held a book party for Max’s book that landed him on the Simon Weisenthal Center’s 2013 list of anti-Semitic slurs. Eric Alterman wrote in The Nation that the book “could have been a selection of a hypothetical Hamas Book of the Month Club.” A quick perusal of his Twitter feed will probably get you up to speed. You can read more about Max here, here, here, here, here, here, and here.

Anyway, back to the September 12 article that Clinton shared and requested to be printed. It’s full of completely over-the-top invective, as per Blumenthal’s usual, but begins with this claim:

The US Ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, and three US diplomats were killed in attacks and rioting provoked by an obscure, low-budget anti-Muslim film called “The Innocence of Muslims.”

And guess who was quoted in the Los Angeles Times (no longer at this url) that same day in a story that said the movie was “blamed the world over for inciting mobs in Egypt and Libya.” One Max Blumenthal.

According to families of the Benghazi deceased, Hillary Clinton vowed to them that she would hold the video maker accountable for inciting the riot in Benghazi. President Obama claimed that in the U.S., “we reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others.” Hillary Clinton said of the U.S. government, “we absolutely reject its content and message.”

It’s true a crude video against Islam was used as pretext by Islamists in various countries for riots and violence. It’s also true that the same video had nothing to do with the coordinated attack on U.S. outposts in Benghazi, resulting in the assassination of U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others. And it’s true that U.S. intelligence knew that there was no spontaneous riot that led to the killings. However, the administration — perhaps in a pre-election panic — claimed it did. The administration even rewrote talking points to blame an imaginary protest against the video as leading to those deaths.

But even if it were true that other people killed in the name of being offended by a video, the ruthless targeting of freedom of speech and freedom of religion (which includes the right to speak against other religions, obviously) by the administration remains one of the darkest moments of the last two terms.

These emails give us a clue as to how the false meme was spread through the administration and media.

Clinton was also sharing information from Juan Cole, a vehement critic of Israeli military and foreign policy, whose style of writing is to call Americans with differing views “Israel Firsters.” A sample of his totally calm rhetoric here. Blumenthal passed along this Juan Cole story, which is one of the less objectionable ones you’ll find. Cole is not a reliable source of information relative to the influence he holds among certain administration officials.

Pls print.

If a friend, much less an employee, ever said of me anything even approaching this sycophancy — “This is simply painfully honest on her part and a moment in time where Higher Purpose shines a bright light on Higher Ground…” — I would assume that I was some kind of tyrant they feared. It was like this scene in last week’s Silicon Valley when Hooli CEO Gavin Belson suspects his employees are too afraid to tell him the truth about failure. He asks his spiritual guru if he’s surrounded by Yes Men. The guru nervously pauses and reassures him that he’s not.

Saving face after First Amendment debacle

One of the emails Clinton allowed to be released was sent September 24, 2012, by Amira Valliani, sharing a column by Bill Keller of the New York Times. It discussed calls to limit free speech and included this portion:

I would cut the diplomats a little more slack when they are trying to defuse an explosive situation. But I agree that the administration pushed up against the line that separates prudence from weakness. And the White House request that Google consider taking down the anti-Muslim video, however gentle the nudge, was a mistake.

In New York Times-speak, this is a brutal condemnation of Obama. Jacob Sullivan forwarded it to Hillary with the note:

An interesting piece. The argument that worked on my conservative Obama-hating (Hillary-respecting) friends, which Keller hints at in the “slack” he’ll cut us, is that our denunciations of the video aren’t an effort to debate the mob; they are an effort to give ammo to the right side to win the battle that Keller himself identifies (between extremists seeking to put “pressure” on weak transitional governments and the more mainstream majority that supports those governments). And you could say it worked. Governments stepped up. Extremist groups in Tunisia are backpedalling.

Etc.



So we need to make this argument forcefully.

She forwarded it to Oscar Flores with the note “Pls print.”

We can glean from this exchange that Hillary Clinton’s trashing of the principle of free expression was going over poorly with voters and that she was looking for a good Clintonian way to justify herself. Sullivan is known for his debating prowess so his suggestion on how to navigate her way out of this mess is not a bad one. It also shows why he’s such a valuable member of Team Hillary.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/05/26/4-sketchy-things-in-hillary-clintons-emails/,2015-05-26
Don’t Let The Wookiee Kill An Open Society,"The counsel, in the moment it is offered, is sound enough. Faced with an opponent who will do anything to prevail in a contest to whose outcome you are indifferent, you should give in. You will lose nothing, as you stood to gain nothing. But what happens when you face an opponent who will do anything to prevail in a contest whose outcome is your life or death?

So I’ve been wondering lately while contemplating the “let the Wookiee win” scene from “Star Wars.” My epiphany (to be exorbitant) about the scene originally occurred in January. Events since then, such as the controversy over the PEN American Center’s award to Charlie Hebdo, the reaction to the terrorist attack on the “Draw Muhammad” event in Texas, and the DC transit system’s recent decision to suspend issue-advocacy ads for the remainder of 2015 so it would not have to run any featuring the winning “Draw Muhammad” illustration, have convinced me that my initial insight was correct.

That insight, simply, is this. On various grounds—fear, a belief that public safety requires it, a conviction that the targets in both attacks were engaged in “hate speech,” a desire not to offend coupled with a misguided sense of respect, whatever—critics of what we might call Islamoclasm advocate that we adopt a “let the Wookiee win” strategy towards violent responses to depictions and criticism of Islam. That is, they think our best, even our only, recourse is to surrender. That may be a fine way to handle Chewbacca, but as a strategy for defending basic freedoms it is ignoble and self-defeating. The problem with letting the Wookiee win is that eventually he insists that you lose forever.[1]

Is Self-Censorship Really Freedom?

“I didn’t say they couldn’t, I said you shouldn’t.” An exasperated Marge Simpson utters these words after Homer Simpson boasts of his success in getting his shirt deep-fried at a fair. With no less exasperation but considerably more hostility, some counter attempts to vindicate Charlie Hebdo and Pamela Geller with a similar formula: “We didn’t say they couldn’t, we said they shouldn’t.” This reproach comes in two flavors. Each pleases some palates, but when tasted by the body politic as a whole both prove bitter.

There seems to be little privilege in spending one’s life in hiding because someone thought you were ‘punching down’ when you were simply moving your hand.

The first variety of this disapproval was given characteristic expression in April by Doonesbury cartoonist Garry Trudeau, when he proclaimed that satire only “punches up, against authority of all kinds” and that the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists erred by instead “punching downward, by attacking a powerless, disenfranchised minority with crude, vulgar drawings closer to graffiti than cartoons.” But it had already been de rigueur among the bien pensant for months, having become so almost immediately after the Charlie Hebdo massacre in January.

The moral and intellectual vacuity of the “punching down” argument is best illustrated by this imbecilic screed, which laments the PEN American Center’s decision because commemorating Charlie Hebdo’s boorishness perpetuates the worst injustice in the world: “Western white culture’s misguided understanding of freedom in relation to denigrating minority cultures.” Only someone who willfully served a long sentence in those university departments whose commitment to basic canons of reasoning, evidence, and argumentation is generously described as modest could write something that leads one to conclude her mind is still imprisoned there.

David Frum, Ross Douthat, and Jordan Fraade, among others, have pointed to inconsistencies and contradictions that render the “punching down” thesis, at least when applied to Charlie Hebdo, fatuous and incoherent. For one thing, there seems to be little privilege in spending one’s life in hiding because someone thought you were “punching down” when you were simply moving your hand. For another, the fact that Islam claims some 1.5 billion worshippers ineluctably leads one to inquire just how powerless are its adherents, really.

Privileging the Favored

The irony of the Argument from Pugilism, as we might call it, is that it exchanges one privilege for another. A privilege is a private law; by definition it belongs to a few and not to all. Privilege demarcates a group and sets it apart from society. Critics of satire of Muslims challenge it on the grounds that it reinforces the advantageous social standing of the satirists. The satirists, they charge, pick on a group that is already on the fringes of society.

There is also a privilege in being exempt from the norms which govern the rest of society.

But there is also a privilege in being exempt from the norms which govern the rest of society. To declare Islam immune from the tumults of the public sphere because fragility or incompatibility renders it incapable of thriving therein is to demand a privilege at least equal to the supposed one that enables the persecution of a defenseless minority.

This privilege has no legal standing. Its proponents seek moral sanction for it. This may be both unnecessary and futile. Why ask for what you can take? As has been demonstrated all too often, some of the powerless and disenfranchised are ready to “punch up”—with fists, knives, guns, and bombs. Any attempt to rescind this privilege is treated as an affront which may be requited with violence. Perhaps, then, we shouldn’t fight at all.

Murder Victims Had It Coming?

“Nobody worries about upsetting a droid.” This conclusion inspires the altogether more sinister variant of disapproval for drawing pictures of Muhammad, the Argument from Provocation, which should be familiar to anyone who closely attended news coverage of the PEN/Charlie Hebdo controversy and the Garland shootings.

Even when there is no intent to offend, some Muslims take offense.

It goes something like this: 1) Some Muslims will react violently to images of Muhammad, which they consider blasphemous. 2) Knowledge of the prohibition and its violent enforcement being widespread among non-Muslims, any activity in which such images are created invites violence. 3) Having possessed this knowledge yet persisted anyway, both Charlie Hebdo’s writers and the organizers of the Texas event were culpable, to whatever degree one cares to assign, for the violence directed against them. All of which is a more polite, circumspect way of saying something nasty: they had it coming.

Reduced to its essence, one can understand the responses this has aroused in those who espy in it an attempt, whether intentional or not, to apportion blame to those who can have no share in it. It is not, though, entirely meretricious. Thomas McDonald articulates the most defensible, and not coincidentally the most modest, version of the provocation thesis. Gratuitous instigation like Geller’s, he contends, picks unnecessarily at those compromises that bind a pluralistic society together. Rubbing someone’s nose in your scorn is not just rude, it is uncivil. You wouldn’t walk up to random Muslims on the street (or Christians, for that matter) and call them heathens or idolaters. Masking your contempt in the cloak of freedom of speech doesn’t disoblige you of basic courtesy.

Such is McDonald’s case, and it is fine as far as it goes. The problem, as he concedes, is that it doesn’t go very far. Geller meant to offend, and offense was taken. But even when there is no intent to offend, some Muslims take offense. And because of their interpretation of Islam’s doctrines, they feel compelled to punish the offense: “idolatry is blasphemy and blasphemy is punished by death.” McDonald acknowledges that “way too many Muslims are willing to murder for their faith,” far more than adherents of other faiths.

Giving the Violent More Excuses

There are no innocent depictions of Muhammad. The concept itself is out of bounds. That is fine for Muslims. But non-Muslims are under no obligation to acquiesce. McDonald is right that one ought not needlessly belittle or be wantonly cruel. But this notion of fair play, when coupled with knowledge of the consequences should one violate it, easily becomes a justification for an exaggerated cautiousness and wariness. It metamorphoses into a conviction that it is better to be safe than sorry, that even if offense isn’t intended one must refrain from saying something lest offense be taken, and those offended react badly.

This notion of fair play, when coupled with knowledge of the consequences should one violate it, easily becomes a justification for an exaggerated cautiousness and wariness.

That is, they may try to kill you because the very act of speaking on the subject is insulting. Not the content or substance of the speech, nor its tenor, but the existence of the words themselves. “[N]obody worries about upsetting a droid.” And quite rightly. But what about all the Wookiees out there?

The dread that “Here be Wookiees” underpins the Argument from Provocation. It is palpable in three of the most egregious responses to the attack on the Geller event, all of which essentially hold her responsible for the assassins’ failed gambit to kill her. One is this article from McClatchy, which Popehat’s Ken White chides as “unusually stupid.” Given that the organizers of the Muhammad art event spent $10,000 on extra security, clearly they anticipated violence. Should, then, authors Lindsay Wise and Jonathan Landay muse, the government have intervened?

After vivisecting the farrago of misinformation and illogic Wise and Landay present (along with their First Amendment “expert,” who apparently doesn’t understand First Amendment case law), White makes a simple observation. Putting the onus on the “provocateurs” effectively “cedes all authority to the offended and provoked.” By letting those who would react violently determine what is offensive, “Wise and Landay are effectively inviting people to be more violent in order to control what speech is permissible.”

The editorial board of the New York Times advances similar claims with its customary rigor. The violence in Texas can’t be justified, but neither can the event that was targeted. Wringing its hands, the Times frets that “provocations like the Garland event . . . can serve only to exacerbate tensions and to give extremists more fuel.” But whose fault is that, those stoking the flames or those who insist on combusting? Why drawing a picture of Muhammad “give[s] extremists more fuel” is a question the Times conspicuously neglects to ask, let alone answer. The fact that Geller succeeded seems to trouble the board’s conscience much less than the fact that she tried.

Capitulation Is the Coward’s Answer

The most execrable specimen of the lot is a column by Harvard University law professor Noah Feldman, who proves once more the wisdom of the adage that there are some ideas so stupid only an Ivy League professor could believe them. That Feldman intends to take a detour off the rails is apparent early when he posits that, when assessing Geller’s conduct, it’s “easy to be distracted by the First Amendment.” Feldman contends that even if Geller did not intend to provoke violence, she “could still be held morally responsible for the foreseeable consequences of her provocation.” In other words, because Geller knew (some) Muslims would react like goons, it is her fault that they did.

This ‘gives the bullies a strong incentive to strike early and often.’

Steven Lubet of Northwestern University decries holding Geller culpable on the grounds of moral hazard as vicious and reprehensible. “Blaming her, even partially and conditionally, for an act of terror stretches moral reasoning beyond the breaking point.” If Geller was soliciting violence by having armed guards, so was the staff of Charlie Hebdo.

Nor may we differentiate between the worthiness of victims: Salman Rushdie is not less responsible for the death of his Japanese translator than Geller is for the shots fired in her direction. “The application of moral principles to extremist violence should not depend upon the acceptability of the victim’s views.” This statement seems unobjectionable, but the existence of Lubet’s op-ed attests that many do object. Lubet realizes that the consequences of Feldman’s logic would be disastrous. “In the wake of threats of murder for the exercise of free expression… Feldman claims that the correct moral response is to shut up.” Echoing White, he warns that this “gives the bullies a strong incentive to strike early and often (thus making their threats more credible).”

The Rise of the But-Heads

How should one confront the threat? By shutting up. In other words, let the Wookiee win. Silence is already falling. As Sean Davis described in these pages, CNN refused to reproduce the Charlie Hebdo drawings after the massacre and bent over backwards to respect Muslim sensitivities even in describing them verbally. Not only would the TV network not show images, it wanted its employees not to picture them in their minds.

Not only would the TV network not show images, it wanted its employees not to picture them in their minds.

The virus became airborne and took on epidemic proportions in late April. This explains the proliferation of those curious, unfortunate creatures—I call them “but-heads”—who rasp, “I believe in free speech, but…” We can recognize them from excessive throat-clearing, which sounds suspiciously like gagging, when they are faced with the unpleasant task of defending the free speech of those who inconveniently were killed for it.

“But but but,” they object, mostly to speech that has the temerity to butt heads, or at least the wrong heads. “We support your free speech,” they protest, “but do you really have to be so gauche about it?” Won’t somebody please think of the writers (on the Upper East Side)?!

PEN did think of the writers. But there’s no pleasing some people—or, rather, there’s no absolution in blood for the sin of punching down. Hence the decision of 200 writers to secede from PEN’s choice to honor Charlie Hebdo for its bravery in the face of intimidation and murder. This moral abdication has been rightly greeted as scrawling once more on the graves of the dead the calumnies which first decorated them as soon as they were dug.

In case anyone had forgotten, there is no such thing as ‘hate speech’ in American law.

Not that the shame is a few-score literati’s alone. The week following the Texas attack found numerous cable news personalities succumbing to the “but-head” virus, swearing allegiance to free speech out of one side of their mouth while tut-tutting “hate speech” and “provocation” out of the other. The aftermath of the Paris massacre presented the sorry spectacle of the outgoing ombudsman for NPR stating that while it is fine “to lampoon popes, imams, rabbis and other temporal religious leaders of this world,” mocking “prophets and gods” is a step too far.

The former occupant of the “James Madison Visiting Professor Chair on First Amendment Issues at Columbia University” also wonders whether courts would find Charlie Hebdo to be “hate speech,” a category with no basis in American jurisprudence. Because, in case anyone had forgotten (and much to the regret of the “but-heads,” one imagines), there is no such thing as “hate speech” in American law.

The Double Standard for Muslims

What law does not grant can still be enforced by custom and social practice. That seems to be the outcome those who wield the Argument from Provocation desire. It may be legal to draw cartoons of Muhammad, but it should not be socially acceptable. Feldman gives the game away. “One goal of the provokers in Texas,” he complains, “seems to have been sending a message to Muslims that their faith may be criticized with impunity.”

Christians find scurrilous depictions of their icons and beliefs no less offensive than Muslims, yet objections to them are dismissed as irrelevant.

As though it is wrong to be able to criticize something with impunity. That’s rather the point. The contrary principle is inimical to those on which American society rests. It is the principle which whispers, from under a table or inside a closet, “let the Wookiee win.” “They made a wasteland and called it peace.”

What else does Feldman think ought not to be criticized with impunity? As numerous commentators have observed, the prohibitions against mocking religion disappear in front of a cross. Devout Christians find scurrilous depictions of their icons and beliefs no less offensive than Muslims, yet objections to them are dismissed as irrelevant violations of America’s social consensus. Why? Because Christians have not massacred anyone lately for dropping crucifixes in urine and calling it art.

You’re Making the Left Look Bad, Guys

The Argument from Provocation rests on a double standard, one which reinforces the privilege I mentioned earlier, the privilege that exempts one religion from the scrutiny to which another is not only allowed to be subjected, but to which it is expected to be subjected. No honest person can fail to see the profound hypocrisy here. Many have, but the blogger Ace of Spades’ lapidary expression of it deserves to be reproduced here.

What those who ostracize the Islamoclasts seem to find most objectionable is not the content of their speech or that someone might try to kill them, it’s having their pieties bruised. As though what they resent is not that their ideological foes are being attacked, but that they are being vindicated. The aggrieved tone complains, “Stop proving yourselves right and making us look bad!” Peering down their noses they pose a question a bully might ask his victim as he takes his victim’s hand and slaps him with it: “Why do you keep hitting yourself?”

All exhortations not to give offense, not to publish, and so forth, are rationalizations built on a brutal and simple moral calculus: Don’t do this, because if you do you are inviting someone to kill you. The sense of invitation, of solicitation is critical. If you draw or publish cartoons about Muhammad, Muslims may react violently. If Muslims react violently, you may be killed. Therefore, if you draw or publish cartoons about Muhammad, you may be killed. You are, in effect, signing your own death warrant. So it’s your own damn fault if you get your brains blown out. After all, you were asking for it. And even if you weren’t, if that Charlie Hebdo kid jumped off a bridge, you wouldn’t jump too, would you?

Sometimes a leap of faith is what is needed. Maybe especially when what is provocative is merely the possibility of provocation. The suggestion that the attack in Texas “is part of a viciously circular infinite regression, in which hatred is proposed at every turn and each new violence provokes a counter-violence” is nonsensical. Only one side is violent: the side with guns and bombs. The solution to violence is supposedly to lay down arms and swear a truce. But when one side’s arms drip with ink and the other’s drip with blood there is no peace to be had. “We will stop drawing cartoons” and “we will stop killing you” are incommensurate concessions.

Eternity Can Defend Itself

Those who think they are equal, that the pen is mightier than the sword because the sword only wounds the body while the pen wounds something greater because intangible—the soul of society or some ineffable value like justice or safety or dignity—will always implore us to let the Wookiee win because they take the enemy at his word. But safety of this kind is not really safety because its maintenance is not in our hands but theirs. Not to mention that “[t]here are only about a million things in life better than being safe, however important safety is. If safety is your highest value, you’ll do anything to keep it.” Salus populi suprema lex esto is what is carved above the gate to the road to perdition.

We must honour the Deity and leave him to avenge his own cause.

We do not normally think of the right to blaspheme as one of our basic rights. We take it for granted now because it has been absorbed into Western society. No one has exercised it because there has been no reason to. It would be considered absurd to punish someone for rejecting the Trinity or Christ’s divinity. Yet a distressingly robust number of people excuse the compulsion to discipline by force those who profane Islam. In some countries this discipline comes at the hands of the state in the form of laws against blasphemy or “hate speech.” Punishing blasphemy, however, can never be a proper function of the state. Montesquieu explained why 260 years ago.

The mischief arises from a notion which some people have entertained of revenging the cause of the Deity. But we must honour the Deity and leave him to avenge his own cause. Indeed, were we to be directed by such a notion, where would be the end of punishments? If human laws are to avenge the cause of an infinite Being, they will be directed by his infinity, and not by the weakness, ignorance, and caprice of man.

The right to blaspheme is not a duty to blaspheme. We are under no obligation to desecrate the Host or draw pictures of Muhammad. But we are no more obliged to allow those who find either action blasphemous to forbid them or dictate our response to them. Choice is intrinsic to the concept of an “individual right.” We may choose to exercise a right or we may refrain from doing so. But this choice must be made freely and without duress or coercion.

Unless these conditions are met, one cannot speak of an individual right, for the choice is being made for one, not by one. I may carry a gun, or I may not. I may testify on my own behalf, or I may not. I may write this essay, or I may not. But none of these choices may be compelled. A person with tape over his mouth is not remaining silent, he is being kept silent. There is no right if it may be exercised in only one direction.

The Cone of Silence Covers More than Islam

It is not only with respect to Islam that the condition of silence has found increasing favor in America these days. Threats to the ability to think and write freely are legion. One of the most salient in recent months has been the penchant of college students to demand “safe spaces” cleansed of speakers and ideas they reprove. The “safe spacers” do not use guns, but they are no less pledged to the idea that certain speech inherently affronts their dignity and must be driven from their presence.

They are animated by an impulse Mill repudiated a century and a half ago.

A theory of ‘social rights,’ the like of which probably never before found its way into distinct language – being nothing short of this – that it is the absolute social right of every individual, that every other individual shall act in every respect exactly as he ought; that whosoever fails thereof in the smallest particular, violates my social right, and entitles me to demand from the legislature the removal of the grievance. So monstrous a principle is far more dangerous than any single interference with liberty; there is no violation of liberty which it would not justify; it acknowledges no right to any freedom whatever, except perhaps to that of holding opinions in secret, without ever disclosing them; for the moment an opinion which I consider noxious, passes any one’s lips, it invades all the ‘social rights’ attributed to me by the Alliance. The doctrine ascribes to all mankind a vested interest in each other’s moral, intellectual, and even physical perfection, to be defined by each claimant according to his own standard.

The cause of social right, like God’s, is infinite; so must punishments of it be, for transgressions, too, are infinite, there being no place in which one can shelter from it. This is less a safe space than an abyss into which one ceaselessly plunges. The space may be safe, but only because it has been sterilized. Nothing dangerous will grow in it, because nothing will grow in it. Tacitus’ words come to mind: “They made a wasteland and called it peace.”

“That whereof one may not speak, thereof one must remain silent,” noted Ludwig Wittgenstein. Morally and intellectually, a wasteland is exactly what a society would be in which certain topics became verboten. There is nothing, as Mill foresaw, that someone will not want to silence someone else about. A tongue for a tongue leaves everyone mute. To remain silent, on occasion one must speak. For example, in the face of those who would still one’s voice forever.

“That whereof one may not speak, thereof one must remain silent.” Silence, a prominent and growing segment of our intellectual cadres has determined, is the proper mode of discussing certain subjects in public. Public authorities have begun to embrace this attitude, also. Hence officials of Washington’s Metro system decided they had to ban all issue ads from their buses, trains, and stations to prevent one ad from appearing there. Silence about one subject, in other words, entails silence about them all.

The End of an Open Society

However it was ordered before, a society in which Wittgenstein’s dictum took hold would be neither liberal nor open. What those who would make propriety a criterion, even the sole criterion, for determining whether something should be discussed in public fail to realize is that Wittgenstein’s dictum is readily transmuted into Tacitus’.

The artists were not punching down, they were punching up—to the very heavens.

For most of human history, religion was regarded as far above man’s understanding. Only in the last few centuries has it become permissible in a few corners of the globe to contemplate the divine without fear of immolating one’s body or soul.

If we are to pay a proper respect to the opinions of mankind, as the postulants of the Arguments from Pugilism and Provocation insist, we may remind them that one of those opinions holds that no one should be slaughtered for drawing a cartoon. That is why those who spurn artists who drew Muhammad for punching down have it exactly backwards. The artists were not punching down, they were punching up—to the very heavens. For what is higher indeed than “prophets and gods”?

Shortly before C-3PO urges R2-D2 to change tack, Obi-Wan experiences the disturbance in the Force caused by the annihilation of Alderaan. He tells Luke it felt “as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened.” We are mercifully short of millions, but here too something terrible has happened and voices have cried out in terror and been suddenly silenced. A far greater disturbance in the Force would await us were we ever to decide to let the Wookiee win.

[1] Astute readers will perceive a resemblance between my victorious Wookiee and Kipling’s Dane. To the best of my knowledge, however, I had not heard of Kipling’s poem until Eugene Volokh cited it in his column on WMATA’s decision to cancel issue ads for the remainder of the year.

How To Defend The U.S. Against A Ballistic Missile Attack,"Today’s newly destabilized world having resurrected the specter of nuclear war, it behooves us to plan for ways to prevent and defend against a ballistic missile attack. Technology is less a bar to such antiwar insurance than are the U.S. government’s illusions and assumptions. Rhetoric aside, U.S. strategic policy is still mired in a 1960s assumption: that the fear of nuclear destruction makes these weapons unusable, and in the illusion that this fear is shared universally.

China, which has threatened to nuke Los Angeles and has been upgrading its missile forces to do just that, builds islands in and claims sovereignty over the South China Sea. Vladimir Putin builds new missiles while promising to back future Crimea-like ventures with Russia’s nuclear arsenal. Both practice killing satellites in space. Iran builds nukes and practiced sinking a U.S. carrier. American policy has not banished the specter of nuclear war.

Our policy is not to interfere with the capacity of Russian or Chinese missiles to devastate the United States. Nor do we defend our military’s electronic nervous system: the satellites that provide our military’s geolocation, communications, eyes and ears. This telegraphs un-seriousness, and invites challenges to vital interests.

America, the Bluffing

The U.S. government imagines that our diminishing nuclear arsenal can protect those interests. But there can be no plans for using it to benefit America so long as official policy keeps us vulnerable to missile attack. This advertises our asymmetric aversion to serious conflict and reduces American strategic policy to a transparent bluff.

“They wouldn’t dare!” is now a wish. What if they dared? What if Russia were to send its “green men” into NATO’s Baltic states as it sent them into Ukraine, or if China were to exclude U.S. ships from the South China Sea, or if Iran were to close the strait of Hormuz—all while destroying U.S. military satellites and brandishing the possibility of nuclear war? What would we do, not having the ability to defend our territory and satellites?

Today’s “national missile defense” is pretense, and not expandable. It consists of 30 interceptor missiles located at Fort Greely, Alaska, plus four at California’s Vandenberg Air Force Base, all to be launched and guided to terminal guidance phase by the Cobra Dane radar at Shemya, Alaska, based on “cues” from early warning radars. These interceptors are also supposed to protect the eastern coast of the continental United States.

We Need Better Early Warning Systems

Launching interceptor missiles only when the incoming warheads are in sight of the interceptors’ associated radar is dysfunctional, for several reasons. This system is stuck in the technical paradigms of the 1950s and the political ones of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The 2002 repudiation of that treaty notwithstanding, its prohibitions against anything that might “substitute for” ground-based radars and control systems, as well as against the use of “other physical principles” are now part of U.S. policy and set our current programs against technology’s logic.

‘They wouldn’t dare!’ is now a wish.

That logic demands that ground-based missile defenses combine early warning and interceptor-programming systems rather than separate the two. That is because efficiency in ground-based defense requires, first, that interceptors be launched on the basis of information from sources as close as possible to the offensive missile’s launch, and, two, that the interceptors be located close to the places to be defended.

Modern technology can combine early warning and fire control in remote systems, and connect them to interceptors based near the places to be defended. Endowing our early warning radars with technology to inform, launch, and direct a host of interceptors on American soil would help.

Seriousness in ground-based defense, however, requires that information systems be based in orbit—with optical technology substituting for radars. This is essential. Since the only ballistic warheads that can reach U.S. soil must be intercontinental, this requires rapid, timely, exact information from satellites that can see over the horizon, and can track, discriminate, sort, and communicate data about missiles and warheads as soon as they clear the clouds. In the 1980s the U.S. government planned such a satellite network—the lower tier of a three-tier system that was known as SBIRS. This was eliminated circa 2005, as per the 1972 treaty’s priorities: space sensors may not substitute for radars.

Time to Revive Laser Defenses

Reversing these priorities means, above all, adopting boost-phase interception of missiles by “other physical principles”—meaning lasers. The 1972 treaty prohibited it because its potential usefulness was already clear. By the late 1970s, our navy had produced a chemical laser that destroyed anti-tank missiles in flight. In 1979, when this technology was brought together with that of the KH-11 satellite, the U.S. space laser program was born. By 1994, The New York Times reported that the first space laser was “nearly ready to fly.” The Clinton administration canceled it.

Orbital lasers’ capacity to strike missiles as they rise into space would give whoever possesses them the capacity to control other countries’ access to space.

Nevertheless, boost-phase defense by lasers is available. In 1996, Grumman/TRW adapted the space laser for the ground-based defense of Israel against artillery rockets—far more difficult technically than deploying in space.

Orbital lasers’ capacity to strike missiles as they rise into space would give whoever possesses them the capacity to control other countries’ access to space, thereby protecting one’s own satellites as well as the capacity to destroy other countries’ satellites. Satellites are easy to destroy and difficult to defend. Any rocket that can launch a satellite can destroy one. Lasers can disable satellites usually with less power than a 100-watt bulb.

Since the laser weapon’s component technologies are becoming common, any major power may decide to place some in orbit. Far better if that power be the United States. Were Iran, China, or Russia to challenge our vital interests, they might begin by eliminating U.S. satellites. We would then reflect how irresponsible it is, absent missile and space defense, to pretend that any interests are “vital.”

"America, The Unserious Super-Power","The United States is no longer a serious country.

Now, by this I do not mean that America is no longer a super-power. By any gross indicator of strength, the United States is as powerful as it’s ever been, perhaps more powerful than at any time in its history. It has a massive, highly productive economy, a military second to none, and an alliance that dwarfs all possible competitors. On paper, it’s still the only super-power on this planet (or on any other that we know of, so far).

But the status of a great nation is built on more than raw power. It includes intangible qualities like respect, admiration, and, yes, fear. We don’t need all three of them; no major power does. But we need at least one of them at any given moment, and right now, we’re bottoming out in each of these measures. President Obama may insist that America is now “the most respected country on Earth”—a claim even the normally more forgiving folks at PolitiFact rate as only “half-true”—but the Russians, Iranians, and Chinese clearly disagree, and for good reason.

The Chinese hack of the Office of Personnel Management is the most recent, and most obvious, example of how our status is going down the drain. This is a disaster of unimaginable proportions. The intelligence damage, including security-clearance information, will last for decades. (I, of course, am one of the millions of federal workers waiting to find out if my files are now in Beijing.) Almost as shocking as the size of this breach, however, is the fact that no one seems to care very much, including the Chinese, who have shown no concern at all.

An Act of War, Ignored

In any normal world, a super-power would not tolerate this kind of an attack. Perhaps more accurately, a true super-power would never have to endure such an attack in the first place, because other nations would be loath to engage in such a direct act of open hostility. States do lousy things to each other all day long, but the wholesale and brazen theft of personnel records is a different kind of espionage. The scale is so vast that it is a direct challenge to the United States of America.

Countries, as a rule, do not do whatever they can do, they do what they think they can get away with.

In response, the most powerful country in the world has drawn itself up to its full height, clenched its mighty fist in anger, and….contracted out for some identity-theft protection for its employees. The majesty of the enraged eagle is truly remarkable to behold.

The critics say the government wasn’t very good at protecting that information. It was wearing its data-management skirt a little short this time, so it deserved this kind of attack. To argue that sloppy information security makes what happened understandable, however, is to miss a far larger point: countries, as a rule, do not do whatever they can do, they do what they think they can get away with, and those are two different things.

There are plenty of things the United States could do, every day, to other nations, including Russia and China. Some of them we do, and some we don’t, because we have some sense of the various costs and risks involved. In those cases where we enjoy a major advantage over an opponent, we can take more direct action, like sending Stuxnet to the Iranians. (Whether we should have been bragging about it is another question.) But we do not simply steal, attack, or destroy everything we can find, because we recognize this could make life a little tougher among nations we have to live with every day.

Our Enemies Display Open Contempt

The OPM hack shows that China has no such compunctions. Our tepid response, sadly, shows that Beijing may have guessed at our response accurately. There are many things we could do, including public denunciation of the act, demarches, sanctions, and other public actions, along with more shadowy things I won’t speculate about here. Instead, we’re watching the Chinese military build fake islands in the middle of the sea while the president tries to figure out why his own party won’t give him more authority to trade with other nations in Asia.

The Iranians have graciously consented to permit us to beg them for a nuclear deal that they have already made clear will not bind them on the issues most important to us.

To get some idea of the scale of this problem, imagine if this whole fiasco had happened the other way around. Think about the tense situation we’d be in today if China said American hackers, at the behest of the U.S. government, managed to steal the personal information of every employee of the Chinese government. Somehow, I doubt that Beijing’s response would be to call Life-Lock for a bulk rate.

The situation elsewhere is no better. The Iranians, after repeated delays, have graciously consented to permit us to beg them for a nuclear deal that they have already made clear will not bind them on the issues most important to us. The mullahs, obviously fearful and full of deep respect for the Obama administration, seized a ship and issued fiery denunciations of the West while we’ve been pleading with them to allow us to legitimize their aggressive ambitions.

And then there are the Russians. Never has a Kremlin regarded an American administration with such a combination of contempt and disrespect. To reverse Michael Corleone’s famous line, it’s not business, it’s personal. Yes, the Soviet regimes before this harbored deep hatred for Ronald Reagan, treated Gerald Ford with utter patronization, and regarded Jimmy Carter as a hectoring bumpkin. But they feared and respected Reagan, and they actually liked Ford even while running roughshod over American objections to Soviet policies. To some extent, they even came to fear Carter (or at least the Carter that emerged as a born-again Cold Warrior after 1979).

Today, the Russians act as if America does not exist. They fly aggressive missions against North America, threaten the Europeans with nuclear attack, and slap our diplomats down for even hinting at their violations of a longstanding treaty. They believe NATO is merely a showy façade, a Potemkin alliance led by absentee American landlords to whom they need pay no attention other than to insult us.

Weakness Invites Aggression

All of this is the end result of almost seven years of passivity in foreign affairs. Candidate Obama promised to talk to countries like Iran without preconditions, which is exactly how not to approach negotiations with people who mean you harm. Later, President Obama adopted a visionary policy of “not being George W. Bush,” despite the immediate and mounting evidence this would not work as a substitute for an actual national-security strategy. Since the debacle of the 2014 midterm elections, the president and his advisers have doubled down, stubbornly clinging to the idea that only lesser mortals really worry about obvious flummery like “national interest,” “reputation,” or “security.”

None of this can end well. Power without intention or principle is meaningless. It does us no good to amass the greatest intellectual, military, and economic capabilities on earth if the only result is to apologize for our own superiority, then to nod sadly when others attack us for having the temerity to exist. We were once a super-power. We were once a serious nation. We can be both again, if we have the will.

For now, however, it seems our enemies understand our situation better than we do.

The Beta Males Who Feel Good About Watching A Man Die,"On the afternoon of July 4 in Washington DC, a teenager with a knife boarded a crowded metro train and attacked a 24-year-old man, Kevin Joseph Sutherland, stabbing him 30 or 40 times and kicking his head repeatedly until he was dead. No one tried to stop him.

The Washington Post reports that “passengers trapped in the moving train huddled at both ends of the car and watched in horror” as the attack took place. There were about ten people on the car, but no one intervened. They just watched Sutherland get beaten and stabbed to death right in front of them.

The story goes on to describe the 18-year-old attacker, Jasper Spires, robbing other passengers, who handed over their cash and tried to avoid even looking at him, hoping to be spared.

“You’re not really sure what you need to do,” said one witness, a 52-year-old woman. “This man is holding a bloody knife. I don’t think anyone was going to try and stop him.” Perhaps that’s not surprising coming from a 52-year-old woman. In general, it’s hard to fault people in this situation for failing to intervene—even though they obviously should have.

I’m Not Sorry I Put Myself First

What is more surprising is a failure to express regret for not having intervened to save a man’s life. One eyewitness posted his account on Reddit, showing no remorse about failing to intervene, and expressing no sacrificial impulse:

…What I don’t wish is that I had somehow tried to attack the assailant. I am a little bit larger than he was, but I would not have won. It’s scary, because if we had been sitting closer and had seen the attack start I probably would have tried to help, and would have been stabbed.



We asked the police if we could/should have done something differently, and they said that we did the right thing—get to safety and get help (well, I guess my wife did the right thing, I’m kind of a dumbass). On top of that, they said to focus on remembering everything you can about the assailant.



I am lucky to be alive. But Kevin is not, and my heart breaks every time I think about it.

This is beta male rationalizing at its finest—and it is terrifying. Here is a full-grown man, larger than the attacker, who instead of thinking afterwards, “Maybe if I had stepped in and done something, that guy would be alive,” can only thank his lucky stars it wasn’t him.

Men Without Chests

That Spires had a knife—what the police said was a “small, black folding knife” they later recovered from a trash can—is no excuse. Any two adult men in that subway car could have stopped him, no matter how crazy or strong he was, and saved Sutherland’s life.

I, for one, would want someone to help me if a man with a knife attacked me on the subway.

That no one did displays not just cowardice but also a callous and unthinking selfishness. The Reddit eyewitness had no idea at the time how many more people Spires would kill, no idea if he would attack the 52-year-old woman or an elderly passenger. He just let him walk off the train into the subway, covered in Sutherland’s blood.

This is essentially the opposite of the spirit of United Flight 93—the heroic selflessness that prompted a group of courageous passengers on 9/11 to attack their hijackers, forcing them to crash the plane in a Pennsylvania field. Once they heard about the attacks in New York and the Pentagon, and knew many more would die if they failed to act, they knew what they had to do—no matter what happened to them.

Morally, the choice facing the passengers on that subway car on July 4 was no different than the one facing the United 93 passengers on 9/11. It doesn’t matter if it’s one life or one thousand, the principle is what counts.

The United 93 passengers understood that principle, which in fact is nothing more than the Golden Rule: do unto others as you would have them do unto you. I, for one, would want someone to help me if a man with a knife attacked me on the subway, especially if he were winning the fight.

Tragically for Sutherland, no one on his subway car that day had the courage to live by this rule.

The Revenge Of The Lost Boys,"What’s going on with young American men? Another mass shooting has led to another round of social and political recriminations. A young man—a “loner” and “adrift,” as usual—seizes a vile cause and attacks innocent people. Amidst the wreckage, we look for reasons that already fit our preconceptions about violence, and we blame racism, guns, unemployment, drugs, a bad family, or whatever else helps us to make sense of the tragedy.

But the truth of the matter is that Dylann Roof (at least from what we know) isn’t that different from so many other young, mostly white men over the past 30 years or so who have lashed out against their society in different ways. Although mass killers understandably seize our imaginations and dominate the media, and not all dysfunctional young males are violent and not all of them gain the publicity they crave. Some are terrorists, others are murderers, and some are merely vandals. A few are traitors and deserters.

What they all have in common is their gender (male), their race (most are white), and their youth (almost all under 30 at their peak destructiveness). Beyond this, they seem to share little beyond a stubborn immaturity wedded to a towering narcissism. In almost every case, they dress their anger in the clothes of ideology: white supremacy, jihad, hatred of abortion, or anti-government paranoia. Stuck in perpetual adolescence, they see only their own imagined virtue amidst irredeemable corruption. In a typical sentiment, Roof wrote before his rampage that “someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me.”

The Lost Boys Arise

This is the battle cry of the narcissist, and we’ve heard it before. Western societies are producing more and more of these Lost Boys, the fail-to-launch young men who carry weighty social grudges. Some of them kill, but others lash out in other, more creative ways: whether it’s Edward Snowden deciding only he could save America from the scourge of surveillance, or Bowe Bergdahl walking away from his post to personally solve the war in Afghanistan, the combination of immaturity and grandiosity among these young males is jaw-dropping in its scale even when it is not expressed through the barrel of a gun.

These young losers live through heroic fantasies and constructed identities rather than through work and human relationships.

Obviously, I am not suggesting that Snowden or Bergdahl are killers. If anything, these lost young men seem to be impossibly sensitive souls. (I will leave aside the actions of Chelsea Manning in this context, whose story is more complex than I can comprehend.) Yet all of them committed immensely destructive acts, and for reasons that were as rooted in their own failed manhood and maturity as Roof’s.There are others: John Walker Lindh, “the American Taliban,” spent his teen years hanging around in Internet chat rooms before became a jihadi at 20. Timothy McVeigh, a bullied little boy, planned his terrorist attack on a federal building after quitting the Army in his twenties. John Salvi, another loner, shot up an abortion clinic at 22. The list could go on.These young losers live through heroic fantasies and constructed identities rather than through work and human relationships: on the Internet, Snowden was “Wolfking Awesomefox,” which almost defies parody, while McVeigh thought of himself as a modern Paul Revere. Their lives, until the moment of their individual tragedy, are full of desperate attempts to spackle over the gaping hole of insecurity that should have been filled by the arrival of manhood sometime after high school.

Deep Frustrations about Sex and Identity

Make no mistake: this is almost exclusively a masculine phenomenon. Women, especially in the West, are not usually the perpetrators of massacres or other spectacular anti-social acts. This is not a novel observation, but it’s worth remembering the important role sex and masculine identity—or the lack of one—play in the life of dysfunctional young men. In many cases, these man-boys are confused about their sexuality and frustrated by their own social awkwardness, and seek to compensate for it. They turn into what German writer Hans Enzensberger called “the radicalized losers,” the unsuccessful males who channel their blunted male social impulses toward destruction.

These man-boys are confused about their sexuality and frustrated by their own social awkwardness, and seek to compensate for it.

These frustrations about sex and identity are especially dangerous when they flare into violence. Roof raged about blacks “raping our women,” a concern almost identical to those expressed by the group of wannabe-jihadis thwarted some years ago in Canada who were obsessed with the idea that Canadian soldiers were raping Afghan women. Eliot Rodger, the young man who killed three people before plowing his car into many others near the University of California-Santa Barbara in 2014, explicitly said he was punishing other men—and, of course, the slutty women who love them—for being more sexually successful than he.

Jihadis, of course, are the object lesson in this kind of deformed male identity. For all their faux piety and supposed distaste for Western immorality, the young men from North America and Europe who gravitate toward jihadism are often gleeful consumers of forbidden Western delights, and they have a particular obsession with rape, pornography, and an adolescent fixation on the subjugation of women. Terrorist organizations overseas are happy to accommodate this need: it’s not a coincidence that almost every time a jihadi nest gets raided, there’s plenty of porn to be found. Even Bin Laden had a voracious appetite for it.

The Narcissistic Revenge of Angry Losers

Angry losers are not a new or exotic phenomenon. What’s different now, however, is how social media and the unarguable growth of narcissism among younger people are creating a new kind of lashing out. It’s not enough to kill people or to strike at symbols of authority like the government; today, a new breed of young losers insists on larger social relevance and mass recognition for their actions. We once thought it disturbing that someone like the Unabomber would demand that the world read his silly manifesto; now we’re surprised if a young man who engages in a gigantic crime of any kind doesn’t leave behind some kind of testimony for his imagined legions of fans on the Internet.

Social media and the unarguable growth of narcissism among younger people are creating a new kind of lashing out.

Young black men, of course, actually harm each other more often and in more disproportionate numbers than the angry white losers. I am not a sociologist, and I am not going to digress into the problems of the inner city. It seems unarguable, however, that young black males who prey on their own society share one essential trait in common with the white losers who act out and harm strangers: they are not men in any sense of the word that connotes responsibility, restraint, self-discipline, or the other traditional masculine virtues.

These are the qualities of “manliness” described by Harvard University professor Harvey Mansfield some years ago, and whose disappearance from modern society Mansfield not only lamented but also presciently warned would have baleful consequences. Like their white brethren, dangerous black males are angry and childish, but their effect usually does not reach beyond their own neighborhoods. Likewise, the media and the public, for a variety of tragic reasons, simply do not respond to the daily violence among young blacks the same way they respond to the showy productions executed by angry white males.

Portrait of a Misfit as a Young Man

Indeed, it is telling that we pay attention only when white kids—or, as in the Virginia Tech case, an emotionally disturbed Asian—snap. There is a subtle, even unconscious racism at work here, to be sure. Perhaps we are shocked when young men who we think might have more of a stake in the social order turn on it. Or perhaps we are now simply numb to urban black violence.

It is telling that we pay attention only when white kids snap.

Even in the world of espionage, however, there seems to be a public double standard: many people look up to Snowden as a celebrity, while just a few months ago former Central Intelligence Agency officer Jeffery Sterling, an African-American, was sent off to federal prison for leaking American secrets with nary a peep from the public. (I think both Sterling and Snowden are criminals, for what it’s worth.)

Still, the alienated young loners, especially those who commit spectacular acts of violence, are largely a white phenomenon. As loath as we are to accept it, Roof is different only in degree, but not in kind, from young men like Lindh, Snowden, Bergdahl, Salvi, Britain’s “Jihadi John” (another middle-class “quiet kid” who turned against his own society) and others.

This is a disturbing charge, but consider for just a moment the ways in all these young men are similar, rather than different. They are aloof, and their peers generally do not understand them. They may be liked in a small circle of people, but they also make those same people uncomfortable. Their adolescence, which should have been shed years earlier, has stayed with them like a worn t-shirt or a beat-up pair shoes they couldn’t bring themselves to throw away. Whether fascinated by hip-hop culture like Lindh and Jihadi John, or living a virtual life online like Snowden, they do not move on to the responsibilities of adulthood.

Working life is out of the question: these are young men who imagine themselves cut out for more important things.

They find education tedious, not least because even the normal challenges of high school require the social skills they lack. College, if they make it that far, is just another arena for social failure. Working life is out of the question: these are young men who imagine themselves cut out for more important things, whether music stardom or greater missions like, say, saving the United States from tyranny or from a foreign war. Or, in Roof’s case, white maidens from the fearsome sexuality of black men.

The military, or at least a fascination with the military and its symbols, is often a short-term solution for these boys. Many of these young misfits are mesmerized, as boys transitioning to men often are, with symbols of sex and power: guns, the military, and heroic medieval myths. (It is now a sad trope that every tragedy inevitably turns up Facebook pages and pictures of the perpetrators in wannabe gangster or paramilitary poses.) Very few Americans serve in the military, yet among this small sample of alienated losers, many either joined or tried to join the Army, including McVeigh, Snowden, Bergdahl, and, while he identified as a male, a young Bradley Manning. Two tried for the Special Forces. (Lindh, I suppose, joined up too, but in a different army.) You don’t have to be a statistician to find that odd.

An Inability to Handle Real Difficulty

Their experiences varied, but none were successful. McVeigh was briefly a competent soldier, but left the Army after being judged too psychologically unstable for the Special Forces assignment he wanted. Bergdahl went to Afghanistan to change the world. When life in the Army turned out to be beneath him, he decided that he was special enough to walk off and reason with the enemy one-on-one—after, of course, leaving a list of gripes. Manning was a problem from his first days in the Army, and was finally sent to Iraq to a desk job.

This Manichean worldview, the division of the world into a childish game of Cowboys and Indians, is another commonality among these man-boys.

Snowden, too, made a run at being a military hero. Unable to finish high school, Snowden tried the military cure and never even got through infantry training. With adolescent fantasies of grandeur, the young Wolfking, the “TrueHOOHA” (as he was known in another of his identities on the Internet) also headed for the Special Forces—every little boy wants to be the bravest soldier in the Army, apparently—only to find that things like standing up straight and getting out of bed in the morning were skills he’d have to master before he could jump out of airplanes with a knife in his teeth.

Snowden found people on the Internet—or, far more likely, they found him—and suddenly, a life with meaning was in his reach. He would be the greatest champion of liberty in U.S. history. Like many permanent teenagers, his political beliefs were rigid, but fickle: before he became a champion of stealing U.S. secrets, he said that people who reveal classified information should be shot. Taking a shortcut to glory, he stole thousands upon thousands of documents, most of which he now admits he never read. These days, he lectures us on our civic duty to democracy from his safe house in Vladimir Putin’s Russia.

This Manichean worldview, the division of the world into a childish game of Cowboys and Indians, is another commonality among these man-boys. Roof chose white supremacy, Lindh and the radicalized losers of Europe chose jihad, Snowden chose a caricature of civil libertarianism. If it hadn’t been one of these causes, it would have been something else: I have no doubt that at some point we will see a mass murder or anti-government attack committed by a spelling reformer or a raw-milk advocate, if that’s what it takes for a screwed-up adolescent to act out his rage against a world that refuses to acknowledges his specialness.

A Failure to Mature Out of Social Confusion

Intelligence analyst John Schindler has identified these males as a generational “insider threat” to the security of the United States. He has a point. For years, Schindler warned anyone who would listen that that the U.S. intelligence community, as he later put it on Twitter, was “one disgruntled, maladjusted dork away from disaster,” and he was right. In a darker but similar vein, former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Dave Gomez noted after the Roof case that many of these young men “are guys with anger issues about race and unfairness and loneliness and inadequacy, and they find this stuff online and start copying the rhetoric. Instead of meeting in a hall somewhere, they meet in chat rooms….and most of them never do anything but talk.”

The mainspring of their actions is a juvenile narcissism that grows out of social resentment and a failure to mature.

The argument here is not that Bergdahl and Snowden are potential killers, or that all introverted or awkward young men threats to society. Indeed, any man who has never gone through phases of introversion and awkwardness is unusual. In fact, sometimes extroverted young men are monsters: in the case of the Boston bombing, the older Tsarnaev brother fits the bill of the creepy, disappointed narcissist, while his younger brother, now sentenced to death, really does seem to be nothing more than an aimless pothead who knew how to have a good time, but who could not bear to disappoint his weird brother.

Nonetheless, social isolation is an important, even key, factor in the paths chosen by these males. The mainspring of their actions is a juvenile narcissism that grows out of social resentment and a failure to mature. And this should matter to all of us, because when society breeds too many narcissistic males determined to get even with a world that denies them their due—the fame, recognition, or sexual mate they think they deserve—we’re all in danger.

Why Modern Society Creates Destructive Outcasts

What we don’t really want to think about, because it challenges our cherished political narratives, is why modern society creates such destructive outcasts. These killers, school shooters, terrorists, or traitors, all of these failed boys—more accurately, failed men—are all incubated in the same environment of social isolation and prolonged adolescence. (Roof, by the way, was almost a “school shooter:” the high-school dropout planned to attack a small college before settling on the AME church.)

To steal a phrase from Sen. Elizabeth Warren: we built that.

How does this happen? Well, to steal a phrase from Sen. Elizabeth Warren: we built that. We, the adults, have made this generation of young men by allowing, over the course of some 40 years, the eventual construction of a hyper-sexualized, publicity-obsessed, winner-take-all twenty-first-century culture in which success means money, sex, and fame at any cost. Young males no longer live in a world where there’s a Jack for every Jill, or where social institutions like schools, the police, churches, or the military—all decimated by repeated social attack since the 1960s—provide some kind of equalizing effect among men, protecting and building up the weaker boys while disciplining and maturing the stronger ones.

The result is that today American youth, and especially the males, live in a kind of “Lord of the Flies” domain where the Wild Boys act without restraint and the weak kids fall off the ledge, without even a noble Ralph to mourn them. The already-anarchic environment of adolescence has been turned completely toxic by the absence of responsible adults and especially of male role models. In the jungle, the strong and aggressive rule, and in that world, the losers, the “kind of a loner” geeks, the misfits, feel they have no place.

They’re not entirely wrong. So they settle on every young loser’s fantasy: Revenge.

Here, however, I am at a loss for a solution, because the answer lies in some kind of long-term restoration of social order among young men. I don’t know how to do that: the multiple horses of promiscuity, affluence (even among “poor” kids), permissiveness, violent and ghettoized teen culture, and perpetual immaturity are so far out of the barn now, and so entrenched in American life, that I have no idea how to stop their corrosive influence on the weaker or less competitive males who are plowed under a society that moves faster than they, and we, can manage.

The already-anarchic environment of adolescence has been turned completely toxic by the absence of responsible adults and especially of male role models.

Older men can no longer mentor younger men in any meaningful numbers. There are not enough of us, and many of us are reluctant to engage in such work in any case. The traditional venues for male socialization (including marriage) have mostly vanished or, in the case of schools, been rendered safe havens from the normal behavior of males in need of discipline and maturing.

Nor can mentors or schools fight the epidemic of divorce, pop culture, the media, and the overall assaults on the creation of the kind of family life that channels men toward creation rather than destruction. There has to be a sea-change in social attitudes, but I’m stumped about how to make that happen in a nation as self-indulgent and as averse to hard introspection as ours is now.

In the meantime, let’s stop arguing over the symbols these failed men choose. Hateful ideologies and dangerous symbols are worth discussing, but we live in a free country and we’re not getting rid of them. Instead, let’s ask the harder question: why are we raising so many boys who will never make the transition to men, and how do we stop their repeated attacks on their own society?

Noah Rothman Says Domestic Terrorist Attacks Reflect a Failed Foreign Policy,"Failure to deal with terrorism abroad makes domestic attacks more likely. That’s according to Commentary’s Noah Rothman who joins David Harsanyi and Mollie Hemingway on today’s episode of the Federalist Radio Hour.

The assistant online editor argues that the attacks like those in Chattanooga “have become a part of life, and will continue, until their roots overseas are stopped.”

Rothman reasons that while an ideological assault is necessary to win the battle of ideas, it must occur in tandem with military action to stop the violence.

"10 Quick, Important Developments On The Planned Parenthood Scandal","Whether or not the story generates major media attention, the Center for Medical Progress’ expose of Planned Parenthood’s participation in the harvesting and sale of fetal organs continues to feature major updates. Here are 10 of them.

1) Injunction On Release Of Potential Upcoming Video

Late Wednesday, the Los Angeles Superior Court issued a temporary restraining order against the Center for Medical Progress, the pro-life group whose undercover journalism has produced three videos showing Planned Parenthood officials engaged in the practice of harvesting of organs from unborn children killed by abortions. Under the terms of the order, the non-profit organization is banned from releasing video of a May lunch attended by three StemExpress officials. The complaint alleges multiple infractions by the Center for Medical Progress, including invasion of privacy, breach of contract, and unfair competition.

The New York Times Supreme Court reporter suggested the injunction was not constitutional.

2) Crisis Communications Firm Helping Planned Parenthood

Politico reported that high-powered firm SKDKnickerbocker is helping Planned Parenthood manage its public relations crisis. It sent out a memo to journalists trying to keep them from reporting on the undercover videos, on the grounds they were obtained under false identification and violated patient privacy.

SKDKnickerbocker also ran Planned Parenthood’s campaign against the Komen Foundation when Komen tried to cut ties with the abortion provider. The firm also managed birth control activist Sandra Fluke’s media operation.

3) Planned Parenthood Claims Web Site Attacked, But Was It?

A few days ago, the Daily Dot reported a hack of Planned Parenthood data, and the news was carried far and wide. It appears to just be a listing of 333 email addresses of Planned Parenthood employees as well as their usernames. Yesterday, Planned Parenthood and SKDKnickerbocker managing director Hilary Rosen began tweeting about an alleged attack on Planned Parenthood’s web site. Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards released an op-ed in the Washington Post about Planned Parenthood generally being under attack a few hours later.

The only problem was that the “attack” wasn’t observed by anyone other than Planned Parenthood officials and their public relations/crisis communications firm SKDKnickerbocker. Further, they were unable to provide any substantiation to their claim that the “attack” came from “anti-abortion extremists,” if it even existed. And then they claimed that the website was restored to working order quickly but that they were taking the website down for the day for extra precaution. And then they replaced their normal splash page with a public relations message about how mean pro-lifers are, including a button to donate.

Who knows what happened, but it looked less like an actual hack or attack of a website and far more like an attempt to orchestrate a public relations campaign to help Planned Parenthood look less like monsters who harvest fetal organs and more like victims.

To be sure, Reuters bought it. Here’s Steve Gorman’s piece “Planned Parenthood reports second website hack in a week.” But even the Associated Press, which has historically had tremendous trouble covering Planned Parenthood non-obseqiously, had a report that took pains to note the lack of evidence for Planned Parenthood’s claims:

The group also took its websites down after a hacker attack it blamed on “anti-abortion extremists” blocked access by what Planned Parenthood said are the sites’ 200,000 daily visitors. The organization declined to say publicly how it knew the attackers were abortion foes, and said it fixed the problem but took its sites down for the day to “ensure that we are fully protected.”

This tweet, which shows the image Planned Parenthood put up, shows how Planned Parenthood’s messaging came off:

“Extremists have wrecked our site. Fortunately, they let us control this page so we can tell you how awful they are.” pic.twitter.com/sIIQROCeAg



Jill Stanek (@JillStanek) July 30, 2015

A later update to the site kept the message that the site was “not available due to an attack by extremists” but had a link to donate, a link to book an appointment, a link to find an abortion clinic, and multiple links to help Planned Parenthood with public relations. There were other fishy things people picked up in the source code of the supposedly attacked site.

4) Media Very Interested In Cecil The Lion, But Not Cecile The President Of Planned Parenthood

According to the Media Research Center, ABC, CBS, and NBC’s news broadcasts dedicated 11 minutes and 13 seconds since July 14 to stories relating to the Planned Parenthood videos and 14 minutes and 1 second since July 28 to the killing of Cecil, a lion in Zimbabwe. While media coverage of the killing of Cecil was uniformly outraged, coverage of the videos showing Planned Parenthood’s fetal organ harvesting programs ranged from non-existent to muted. There was no outrage.

Andrew Kaczynski, a political reporter at BuzzFeed, responded to criticism of the lack of coverage of Planned Parenthood:

@a_landen we’ve had a lot of Planned Parenthood coverage.



Andrew Kaczynski (@BuzzFeedAndrew) July 28, 2015

BuzzFeed has covered the Planned Parenthood story a bit, including two pieces by Kaczynski (who has shown significant journalistic interest in the story on his Twitter account), “Tim Kaine: Undercover Planned Parenthood Video ‘Very Troubling,’ ‘Extremely Troubling,'” and “Scott Walker: Undercover Planned Parenthood Video ‘Absolutely Horrifying And Disgusting.'”

The other stories are “Bobby Jindal Investigates Planned Parenthood After Undercover Video Emerges,” “Attorney General Of California To Review Organization Behind Planned Parenthood Videos,” “Huckabee On Planned Parenthood Video: ‘Only Since The Nazis’ Have We Seen Such Indifference To Human Life,” and a defense of Planned Parenthood headlined, “The Real Story Behind That Video Of An Abortion Doctor Discussing Harvesting Organs.”

So six stories on the three shocking videos about Planned Parenthood. Three on July 14, one on July 16, one on July 22 and one on July 26. As for Cecil the Lion:

So six stories on reports of the killing of Cecil the Lion. One on July 27, one on July 28 and four on July 29. In addition to the differing levels of enthusiasm for covering the story, you probably also detect a wildly different tone.

5) Hillary Clinton Says Videos Are ‘Disturbing’

Planned Parenthood had told journalists and other organization supporters to ignore the videos. But during a sit-down interview with the New Hampshire Union Leader, Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton said of the undercover videos showing Planned Parenthood officials discussing the harvesting and sale of aborted fetal organs, “I have seen pictures from them and obviously find them disturbing.”

6) Planned Parenthood Poll Mocked

Planned Parenthood attempted to push poll results from a poll they commissioned that showed high support considering their fetal organ trade scandal. The only problem was the questions were laughably bad.

Planned Parenthood commissioned a poll by a Dem firm showing Planned Parenthood is popular. Here is the Q they asked: pic.twitter.com/lbw4FIqA3Q



John McCormack (@McCormackJohn) July 28, 2015

Even if the question made grammatical sense (“vote immediately vote”?), the question couldn’t be more biased. Among many other problems, it doesn’t even mention what the undercover videos have revealed, says not one word about trafficking in fetal organs, or even that Planned Parenthood performs abortions.

One Twitter user joked:

@McCormackJohn “Would you say you are more in favor of women’s health, or of cancer?”



Andrew S. (@shoutingboy) July 28, 2015

That Hillary Clinton said the video images were disturbing was probably a more reliable indicator of how horribly this scandal is hurting Planned Parenthood. That wouldn’t be surprising. A report this week looked at how pro-life messaging actually influences voter behavior. The results, which looked at political messaging in the Texas gubernatorial race between late-term abortion proponent Wendy Davis and Gov. Greg Abbott, showed:

The best targets for pro-life messaging were Democratic-leaning women, young voters and Hispanic voters. Exposure to just one pro-life video ad shifted Democratic-leaning women by 10 points away from Davis and toward Abbott.

7) Planned Parenthood Fails To Show Up To Texas Hearing

The Texas Senate Health and Human Services Committee held a hearing to look into how Planned Parenthood affiliates in Texas engage in the fetal organ trade. However, Planned Parenthood officials didn’t show up. Texas is one of several states where investigations into Planned Parenthood have begun. The more than $500 million that Planned Parenthood receives from taxpayers each year is divided between federal and state funds, so these investigations pose a threat to some of Planned Parenthood’s budget.

The hearing did feature testimony from Abby Johnson, a former Planned Parenthood clinic director, who discussed how her clinic harvested organs from the children aborted at her clinic. She said her clinic received $200 per specimen. She claimed that costs for such harvesting were minimal (only $5-$10 per specimen, by her telling) and that the Houston Planned Parenthood clinic, if it charged only $100 per specimen and if only half of the women seeking abortions each day consented to donations, would generate $120,000/month selling baby parts. This claim somehow didn’t make it into mainstream news accounts of the hearing here, here, here or any where else. You can listen to it here at two hours and thirty minutes into the hearing.

8) Trouble for Rocky Mountain Planned Parenthood

Rocky Mountain Planned Parenthood was featured in Tuesday’s video release showing the dissection of a recently killed baby boy. In the video, Rocky Mountain Planned Parenthood Vice President and Medical Director Savita Ginde appeared to negotiate the sale of baby parts.

On Wednesday, Alliance Defending Freedom filed a complaint with Colorado against a Rocky Mountain Planned Parenthood abortionist and another employee. The two employees, according to ADF, failed to comply with Colorado law when they failed to report the sexual abuse of a 13-year-old girl, performing an abortion on her without telling her parents, and returning her to the custody of the sexual predator who brought her for an abortion. He continued to sexually abuse her.

9) #UnplannedParenthood

On Twitter, people who had unplanned pregnancies or were the result of same posted their stories. A sample:

My birth mother was 16 when she had me. She gave me up for #adoption. I’m alive because of that decision. #unplannedparenthood

10) Planned Parenthood Mammogram Falsehood Resurrected

In an interesting Washington Post article about the problems this Planned Parenthood story poses for Democrat, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley said:

‘I haven’t seen the videos. And I don’t generally make a habit of responding to right-wing videos,’ O’Malley told reporters in New Hampshire this week. ‘I do know that 97 percent of the work that Planned Parenthood does is about mammograms and preventative health. So that’s what I know but I’ll defer to others for commenting on that video and whatever videos they’re pumping out there.’

No, O’Malley, 97 percent of Planned Parenthood’s work is not mammograms. In fact, zero percent of Planned Parenthood’s work is mammograms because Planned Parenthood doesn’t do a single mammogram. Planned Parenthood falsely made the claim that they did during their campaign to shame the Komen Foundation into continuing to fund them, and some media asserted it as well. President Obama has regularly made the claim during his War on Women messaging.

The only problem is that it’s just not true. From a Washington Post fact check a few years ago:

The problem here is that Planned Parenthood does not perform mammograms or even possess the necessary equipment to do so.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/07/30/10-quick-important-developments-on-the-planned-parenthood-scandal/,2015-07-30
Public Relations Firm SKDKnickerbocker Scrubs Website Of Tie To Planned Parenthood,"Politico reported that high-powered firm SKDKnickerbocker is helping Planned Parenthood manage its public relations crisis over the release of footage showing its medical officials engaged in the trafficking of organs harvested from recently aborted children.

SKDKnickerbocker sent out a memo to journalists trying to keep them from reporting on the undercover videos, on the grounds they were obtained under false identification and violated patient privacy.

Planned Parenthood botched a portion of its difficult public relations campaign when it was unable to provide any evidence at all for a claim that the group’s site was under attack and had to be shut down. As explained in “Planned Parenthood ‘Hacking’ Sure Looks Like An Orchestrated PR Stunt,” Planned Parenthood’s web page seemed to function fine. It just replaced the page with a claim of an attack, but then directed visitors to give the group money or otherwise help with their public relations campaign.

Some in the media, such as Reuters, reflexively ran with the abortion provider’s claim. But the Associated Press and CNN noted the lack of evidence for any attack on the website this week.

By Thursday the group changed its tune, saying the site was down for maintenance, not because of an attack.

It was a rare miss for SKDKnickerbocker, which has previously done highly effective work for Planned Parenthood, Sandra Fluke, and other high-profile advocates of abortion rights.

But Planned Parenthood wasn’t the only site undergoing maintenance and changes. SKDKnickerbocker also took the opportunity to scrub its site. If you go to SKDKnickerbocker’s site, you see a page with pictures and profiles of staff. These Democratic heavy hitters brag in their profiles of their ties to President Obama and Democratic candidates such as Hillary Clinton. Here’s former journalist Kate Nocera of BuzzFeed! Here’s a dude who did media relations for Jim Obergefell, of recent Supreme Court victory fame. Here’s Julie Norton, who went from the Clinton administration to fighting 2nd Amendment protections, and now lives in Dupont, “where she can frequently be seen walking her beautiful Goldendoodle, Scout, and her partner’s somewhat less-attractive pug, Marley.” (Yes, I read every staff bio, why do you ask?)

But after the Planned Parenthood story broke, and after SKDKnickerbocker’s role in the group’s crisis communications plan was brought to light, an interesting thing happened. All employee profiles stayed the same, except for one: Nell Callahan’s. Here’s what Nell’s profile looks like now:

And here’s Nell’s profile on July 26:

What was scrubbed after July 26?

Since joining SKDK, she has played an integral role in launching The New Republic’s redesign, framing the freight rail industry’s commitment to infrastructure investment and telling Planned Parenthood’s story during the 2012 election cycle.

What a hat trick of disaster! The New New Republic, the freight rail industry’s commitment to infrastructure, and Planned Parenthood?

I don’t blame Nell Callahan for wanting that off of her profile.

Even Abby Gardner, the lady who managed Sandra Fluke, isn’t too embarrassed to mention it

But kudos to Callahan and her colleagues. Not everything’s going horribly. They managed to get CBS News to publish a very weird 10-minute defense of Planned Parenthood from Vice President Dawn Laguens. It’s very … long. And she just utters talking points for 10 minutes with no response from an ideological opponent. Who knows — maybe someone less inclined to defend the harvesting of organs from aborted children will get equal time soon.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/07/31/public-relations-firm-skdknickerbocker-scrubs-website-of-tie-to-planned-parenthood/,2015-07-31
Politico Bureau Chief Falsely Attacks Boehner For Ignoring 9,"Today marks the 14th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which means you can count on politicians of all stripes to issue statements about the event and its meaning.

After noting that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi had issued a statement, John Bresnahan, Politico’s Capitol Hill bureau chief, attacked House Speaker John Boehner for issuing a statement about the September 11, 2012, attacks on Benghazi, and ignoring the original 9/11 attacks of 2001.

.@NancyPelosi issues statement commerating 9/11, @SpeakerBoehner has statement commerating Benghazi. Even our terrorist attacks are partisan



John Bresnahan (@BresPolitico) September 11, 2015

There’s only one problem with Bresnahan’s sneer about Boehner: the claim isn’t true. In addition to spending a good portion of the morning tweeting his remembrances of 9/11, Boehner also published a video and a short essay about where he was when he first heard about the terrorist attacks:

This is the story of where I was on 9/11.



It’s not remarkable or altogether different from the stories of many Americans. I remember what I was doing when the first plane hit. I remember trying to go about my morning. I remember when everything changed.



My story could be much different, if not for the heroes on Flight 93. We know they saved countless lives and quite possibly the Capitol itself.



They saved us all, really. At the lowest moment in our history, they lived up to our highest ideals. Through tremendous love and sacrifice, they did the unforgettable — as did so many on those three sacred pieces of soil. Now our brave men and women serve in their memory, engaged in the great task of keeping us safe and free.



So our sorrow is still deep, but our faith is deeper still. These are our stories, but this will always be their day.

According to the source code of the page on Boehner’s site, Boehner’s essay and video were published on his web site at 7:02 a.m. Eastern time, more than three hours before Bresnahan, ostensibly a journalist trained to find and report facts, chose to slam Boehner for focusing on Benghazi instead of the 2001 attacks. Boehner’s Benghazi statement, which was limited to a single paragraph, wasn’t posted until after 9:00 a.m.

Boehner also tweeted a series of thoughts and links about 9/11 an hour before Bresnahan insinuated on Twitter that Boehner had done no such thing:

Carly Fiorina’s Identity Politics,"Carly Fiorina’s lauded performance in last week’s GOP debate has made her the flavor of the week for pundits itching to find someone to take down Donald Trump and push back the tiresome Democrat war-on-woman charge that has blighted the GOP in recent election cycles. But Fiorina isn’t the panacea so many are making her out to be. She’s weak on many issues compared to the other candidates, and she plays the game of identity politics—something our country doesn’t need.

When Trump criticized Fiorina much in the same way he criticizes many people, she launched a response rooted in identity politics. Trump said, “Look at that face,” and she interpreted the criticism as sexist. Her ad, “Faces,” rallies all women together in response to Trump. Despite what commentators like Kim Strassel might think, Fiorina did play the gender card, and reinforced it during the debate when she said, “I think women all over the country heard clearly what Mr. Trump said.”

The assumption here is that an attack on Fiorina’s looks or persona is an attack on all women – classic identity politics. Was Trump being sexist with that comment? Was he criticizing Fiorina as a woman? Look at it from this angle: Was it an attack on all blacks when Trump criticized Ben Carson as an “okay doctor”? Did we see Carson respond with an ad saying, “Look at all these black doctors. We’re leaders. We’re successful, too”? Was it an attack on all Christians when Trump questioned Carson’s faith? When Trump criticizes Marco Rubio, should all Hispanics be offended? Will we be seeing ads about women, blacks, Christians, and Hispanics flooding the airwaves every time Trump says something critical of an individual candidate? Let’s hope not.

Carly Fiorina Claims She Represents an Interest Group

Was it an attack on all women when Fiorina criticized Barbara Boxer’s looks when running for the Senate? In case you missed it, Fiorina was caught off mic, saying of Boxer, “Just look at that hair!” and laughing. Pretty hypocritical, don’t you think? Speaking of hair, how many times has Trump been criticized for his hair, his looks, his persona? Has that been sexist? Should Trump rally all fair-haired men to his cause?

Fiorina has actually advanced the notion that the GOP is sexist and doesn’t care about women’s issues.

While Fiorina calls out Democrats in her ad, saying women are not a “special-interest” group, we all know the ad was aimed at Trump, not the Democrats. It wasn’t Hillary Clinton who criticized Fiorina’s face. It was a male GOP candidate, and everyone commenting on the ad has put it in that light (she sure did put that sexist Trump in his place!). While many have praised Fiorina for pushing back on Trump and the war-on-women meme, she has actually advanced the notion that the GOP—and not just Trump—is, in fact, sexist and doesn’t care about women’s issues.

A frustrating fact of political life is that female Republican candidates do little to convince critics that the GOP is for women. That’s because their policy positions eventually “out” them as being anti-women in the eyes of skeptics. This is already happening to Fiorina even as pundits in the Beltway are going giddy over their chosen Trump-slayer.

Carly Can’t Out-Special-Interest the Left

Igor Bobic has written at the Huffington Post that while Fiorina seemed to trumpet the cause of all women in her response to Trump in the debate (see, even he gets it—liberals do love identity politics, don’t they?), “she hasn’t done so where it matters most—in her campaign platform.” Bobic goes on to list the GOP’s typical “anti-women” positions: abortion, Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, Paycheck Fairness Act, maternity leave, etc. So, according to Bobic, Fiorina has played the gender card in one way but not in another.

By interpreting Trump’s comment as sexist, Fiorina played right into the Left’s identity politics narrative.

Andrea Flynn agrees, writing at The New Republic, “Fiorina is helping the Republican Party in its efforts to turn Trump’s misogyny against him, to simultaneously usher him out of the race and curry favor with the crucial women’s vote. She hopes to convince women that the party is not actually out of touch with them. But make no mistake: If Fiorina gets through the gates, she will attempt to rout women’s rights in America.”

So, no matter how much Fiorina goes after Trump, she will convince few people already critical of the GOP that the Republican Party is pro-woman. Identity politics has already done its job on that front.

By interpreting Trump’s comment as sexist, she played right into the Left’s identity politics narrative. Instead of taking the criticism personally—that it had to do with Fiorina and only Fiorina—she broadened it, generalized it, and brought in all the sisters to identify with it. The Left applauded her because they always think this way. What’s shocking is that those who normally oppose such group-think shenanigans are also applauding her, failing to see that she is working from the exact same playbook as Clinton when it comes to public perception about women in GOP politics.

Carly Fiorina Has Played the Gender Card Before

It’s also not the first time Fiorina has played the gender card. When she ran against Chuck DeVore in the California Senate primary, she said, “A woman stands a better chance of defeating Boxer. . . . I have nothing against white men, I am married to one. But Boxer has defeated [them] over and over again.”

Now we have our own candidate playing feminist identity politics.

Michelle Malkin wrote at the time, “In keeping with Fiorina’s identity politics-driven campaign, she also said today that even though she didn’t follow the nomination closely, she would have voted to confirm Obama SCOTUS pick Sonia Sotomayor. An Obama echo, not a choice.”

Playing the identity politics card when it comes to public perception is no small matter. It’s not something we should sweep under the rug as we consider our next president. Ever since Clinton announced that she wanted to be the next president, the Right has been bracing for more feminist identity politics and all the manipulations that go with it.

Now we have our own candidate playing feminist identity politics. This only confirms in the minds of voters that GOP men are sexist, and Fiorina’s platform does nothing to change their minds. At the end of the day, she has done little to stem the war-on-women tide, and many of her policy positions—from a conservative perspective—aren’t what America needs. They’re weak, ill-defined, and, at times, mimic the Left.

Carly Fiorina Is No Conservative

When Fiorina ran against DeVore, Erick Erickson of RedState supported DeVore because “Carly’s conservative record was thin to nonexistent, and there were many troubling signs that she held liberal views.”

Carly Fiorina’s oft-repeated claim to be a ‘lifelong conservative’ was only plausible in the universe of NRSC [National Republican Senatorial Committee] staffers who recruited her in the first place. During the primary, Fiorina aggressively positioned herself to the right, aided by millions in self-funding and the support of a DC-based network more interested in her money and her connections than in any conservative principles.

Do we really need that when we have candidates who are so much better on the issues? While Fiorina’s Planned Parenthood comments during the debate got a lot of fist-pumping (just like immigration hawks at Trump rallies), Rand Paul has been fighting to defund Planned Parenthood more fiercely than anyone. So has Ted Cruz. We have governors who have actually done it. While other candidates on the same stage have been working to save babies’ lives, Fiorina has been inconsistent on the issue. She’s now an outspoken advocate for pro-life policies, but she has endorsed funding for embryonic stem cell research—something most other candidates have not.

One good sound-bite in a debate about defunding Planned Parenthood doesn’t change the fact that when it comes to the issues. Fiorina pales in comparison to her counterparts. On education, she has criticized Common Core but supported No Child Left Behind, and the only specific proposal she has put forth increases federal funding to education. In her Massachusetts Institute of Technology dissertation, she wrote, “I have ended by believing that we will never meet our own expectations of public education unless the federal government is willing to play a consistent, long-term role.”

Compare that to Paul, who opposed reauthorization of No Child Left Behind, opposes Common Core, and says in no uncertain terms that the federal government should not be regulating education: “More local control is better.” Paul supports school choice for parents and in 2013 voted in favor of an amendment making federal education dollars portable. When it comes to education, Fiorina isn’t even in the same ballpark as Paul.

Fiorina’s Platform Weaknesses Don’t Stop There

Regarding the budget, Fiorina is also weak. She supported portions of the Obama stimulus, the Wall Street bailout (TARP), and in 2011, Fiorina, then the vice chairman of the NRSC, went on CNN to attack conservative House members who were fighting against a debt ceiling increase without real spending cuts.

Fiorina says she wants to throw punches at Clinton on the issues, but how can she when she has sometimes sounded just like Clinton?

Compare that to Cruz, who has opposed raising the debt ceiling, voted for an amendment balancing the budget in five years without raising taxes, and voted against the massive 2014 omnibus bill. Paul and Rubio also have stellar records compared to anything Fiorina has proposed.

She’s also weak on the environment. Fiorina believes in man-made climate change, is soft on cap-and-trade, and refused to overturn the economically harmful Global Warming Initiative.

Compare that to Paul, who has always opposed cap-and-trade schemes, voted to remove all energy subsidies, and was one of the eight cosponsors of a 2011 amendment to ban the Environmental Protection Agency from promulgating carbon emission regulations. Cruz has also been an aggressive fighter against federal energy and environment abuses. He rejects man-made global warming, introduced the American Energy Renaissance Act of 2014, opposes cap-and-trade, and was one of the few Republicans who opposed federal land grabs in the National Defense Authorization Act.

Fiorina says she wants to throw punches at Clinton on the issues, but how can she when she has sometimes sounded just like Clinton? As Daniel Horowitz writes at Conservative Review, “During the 2013 Obamacare funding showdown, Carly ripped into Ted Cruz, echoing the Democrat talking points about the ‘Cruz shutdown.’ She also said she felt bad for John Boehner. If you look at her statement carefully, this runs a lot deeper than the issue of defunding Obamacare. She is fundamentally parroting the establishment talking point that Republicans will always get blamed for a shutdown and ultimately must always accede to the Democrat demand – no matter the issue.”

She is also parroting Clinton’s talking point against Republicans. “How can Carly throw this punch if she has articulated the premise just as passionately as Hillary?” Horowitz asks.

Like Clinton, Fiorina has accused Republicans of sounding like racists regarding the border debate.

On immigration—something clearly very important to GOP voters—Fiorina falls short of other candidates. Like Clinton, she has accused Republicans of sounding like racists regarding the border debate: “There has been a very unfortunate racist tone that has emerged in a lot of the discussion about immigration and that’s inexcusable. We must be a country that welcomes legal immigrants to this country. We must be a country that recognizes that we have industries like agriculture that have depended on temporary migrant labor for generations.” Fiorina also supports the DREAM Act—amnesty for young illegal immigrants.

Compare that to Cruz, who has introduced legislation blocking Obama’s expansion of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program and supports closing the birthright citizenship loophole, or Rick Santorum, who laid out a plan in 2015 to decrease immigration by 25 percent in order to protect American jobs.

The GOP Candidate Needs to Be Big-Tent

When it comes to the issues, Fiorina isn’t the best candidate by far. Not only that, she sends mixed signals regarding identity politics, both playing the gender card then tossing it aside, confirming to skeptics that GOP men are anti-woman and that her own policy platform is pretty sexist, too. What the GOP needs is not a woman who plays identity politics while being weak on the issues, but a candidate who doesn’t worry about identity politics, stands for all Americans, and has the conservative platform to truly make America great again for everyone.

The GOP needs a candidate who doesn’t worry about identity politics, stands for all Americans, and has the conservative platform to truly make America great again for everyone.

As John Hawkins writes at Townhall, people might be excited about Fiorina because of her debate skills, but what people think about her is very different from what she actually is. Because of that, Fiorina is going to follow the 2012 pattern. “People will initially get excited about her, find out what her record really looks like and then she’ll quickly implode.”

Given this fact, those fist-pumping Fiorina in the aftermath of the debate should take the advice Erickson gave to California voters: Go ahead and vote for Fiorina, “But do so understanding who Carly Fiorina actually is. The mask is off, and there’s a squishy moderate underneath. In the Golden State, the sad truth is that our best hope is to replace a radical with a RINO. Considering the choice we could have had, that’s a shame.”

The same is true today. When it comes to the presidency, we don’t need to replace a radical with a RINO. We have other choices.

China’s President Arrives Triumphantly In Washington DC,"President Obama will host the leader of China this week as President Xi Jinping arrives for his first state visit since assuming power. The visit is not without controversy because U.S.-China relations are not good. The president’s critics say China—like Russia, Iran, and the Islamic State Caliphate—represents another Obama foreign policy failure. These critics are right: Obama is being bested because he doesn’t respond to aggressors who are seeking to change the world order at the expense of U.S. interests.

First, who is Xi Jinping? He’s the most powerful Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping, who led China from 1978 to 1992. Xi came to power in 2012 and embarked on four major initiatives: 1) consolidate as much power as he can in his own hands; 2) root out corruption by focusing especially on prosecuting his rivals (which provides a bonus of securing his own power); 3) accelerate the maturation of China’s economy by making it more dependent on consumer spending at home and less on exports; and 4) begin to assert China’s power in its region to thwart U.S. hegemony.

Despite the Economy, Xi Is on a Roll

He’s accomplished a lot on his initiatives, except for improving the economy. Xi is large and in charge, gathering to himself all the key levers of politics and the military and determined not to share power or be simply the first among equals, like his predecessors. He’s put a lot of rivals in jail, many of them the favorites of previous party leaders who continue to try to wield influence.

At the same time, he believes corruption is a sickness eating at China, along with materialism and decadence, so by wielding the judicial system more like a club than a sword he has made a decently sized dent in Chinese corruption. There is plenty of it, of course, just as one would expect with state-directed crony capitalism in a country ruled by the Communist Party. He’s probably not done enough to blunt the frustration of the average Chinese person not blessed with great party connections, but the main goal was always to eliminate rivals and seal Xi’s control of China.

The worst and most inefficient performers in the Chinese economy received even more money in a desperate attempt to keep the system afloat.

Maturing the economy got sucker-punched recently with China’s stock market problems, which have helped cause the U.S. stock market’s correction. This came after Xi’s predecessor had spent trillions to keep the export-driven economy growing after the 2008 Great Recession, and he’s had no chance to abandon this effort. Most of the spending over the last eight years was to prop up exports and, worst of all, to provide loans to state-owned firms and banks. So the worst and most inefficient performers in the Chinese economy received even more money in a desperate attempt to keep the system afloat.

The problem of “ghost cities” and empty skyscrapers has only gotten worse. One thing no Chinese premier wants is to preside over a slowing economy, but it appears that is what Xi is doing. Despite those who have hyperventilated about China taking over the world, that was not going to happen, and the evidence is plain now. China’s state socialism is running out of steam.

Aside from these troubles, in geopolitics Xi is clearly on a roll. From cyber warfare, to expanding China’s physical presence in the South China Sea, to naval shows of force near the United States, China is starting to treat the United States like the power that used to keep it in check.

You Don’t Scare Us

After years of cyber-attacks on U.S. corporate interests for industrial espionage, the Chinese hit the jackpot when they successfully hacked the Office of Personnel Management. Upwards of 20 million current and former government employees are exposed. Some of their most sensitive personal information regarding finances, family, and health are in the hands of the Chinese government.

For China to commit such an attack says a lot about how little it fears crossing the Obama administration.

Besides simply selling the Social Security numbers to criminals who deal in identity theft, China’s damage to our national security networks both now and into the future is incalculable since the privacy of victims’ families is compromised. We are still awaiting the Obama administration’s response. It took months for the administration to admit that China was behind the attack, and still no word on what the response will be other than public handwringing about the need to respond forcefully as a deterrent.

The United States would have been better served by an OPM that was on its guard, but also by a posture in the world that warded off such unprecedented attacks. Every country that can spies in as sophisticated a way as possible, but for China to feel free to commit such an attack says a lot about how little it fears crossing the Obama administration.

Expanding China’s Military Force

In the South China Sea, China continues to sail provocatively into the territorial waters of its neighbors, but more importantly it has spent the last year building up a bit of reef among the disputed Spratly Islands (disputed by China, Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines) for “reclamation purposes.” In reality, they were building a military base, complete with airstrips and sophisticated listening devices.

The message was clear: we are a blue-water navy now, and will act as provocatively as we see fit.

The emerging complex of buildings is coming close in size to the Pentagon, and experts say some of its equipment appears to be the kind that supports China’s new “carrier killer” missile system that ostensibly has U.S. warships as its target. This weapon was featured in early September at China’s unprecedentedly huge military parade that was meant to signal Xi’s personal political power internally and China’s geopolitical power externally.

Finally, adding insult to injury, the Chinese navy sailed five ships through the Bering Sea in international waters off the coast of Alaska— two weeks ago when President Obama was visiting the state. The move was within the bounds of international law, but the message was clear: we are a blue-water navy now, and will act as provocatively as we see fit.

Of course, China has every right to build its navy, but to make this venture near Alaska for the first time ever with the U.S. president nearby was a challenge to America’s status as the dominant global power. While not as serious as the cyber attack on OPM or the buildup in the Spratly Islands, it highlights the loss of prestige the United States has suffered during the Obama years. Prestige—respect—in international relations is an important tool along with economic and military might. In fact, the latter is less needed when the former is in good supply.

China Looks Strong, America Looks Weak

So there is the context of the Chinese leader’s state visit: he’s chalked up success after success against his American counterpart, and so far paid no price for it. His victim will honor him in the highest fashion. Before he even arrives for that triumph, Xi will start his week co-hosting a forum with Microsoft in Seattle, where he’ll also meet with Tim Cook, Warren Buffett, and Jeff Bezos, among other corporate leaders (such as from Google and Uber).

The United States has never before had a president and a foreign policy elite that appears so unaware of how weak it looks, how out of touch with reality.

Xi knows how important it is to the Chinese public that he be seen as a “winner” so they can feel like winners (I promise this is not an allusion to Donald Trump, but nativism is nativism), and this visit helps him immensely: China looks strong, America looks weak.

The United States has never before had a president and a foreign policy elite that appears so unaware of how weak it looks, how out of touch with reality—in a word, clueless. They’re clueless because they deny not just the reality of current events, but of how the world works—how it has always worked and always will. Whether you believe the cause of aggression is the security dilemma or original sin, the fact of aggression and the need to guard against it with more than words is reality.

Not to the president: he will give the equivalent of a Roman triumph to yet another world leader who knows his mark and takes his advantages while he can. After all, January 2017 is coming, and this is still the United States to be dealt with. Who knows what kind of cowboy or cowgirl they could bring to power?

Surprise! OPM Hack Is Worse Than We Thought,"While the nation was distracted by Pope Francis’ speech at the White House and subsequent parade today, the Office of Personnel Management announced that the Chinese hack on government employee information is worse than they initially told us.

As it turns out, 5.6 million people’s fingerprints have been stolen in a colossal hack on OPM earlier this year. The newly reported number is more than five times larger than the original estimate of 1.1 million stolen fingerprints, although the total number of people estimated to have been affected by the hack remains at 21.5 million.

Ironically, the announcement comes during Chinese President Xi Jinping’s first visit to the United States since taking office. While the hackers responsible for the OPM breach were definitely Chinese, the White House has been hesitant to point the finger at the Chinese government and has yet to retaliate for the cyber attack.

Yesterday, Xi repeatedly insisted that the Chinese government was not behind the attack, insisting it was the work of corporate espionage. While delivering a speech in Seattle, he said that China is eager to work with the United States to combat cyber theft, which he said their own government has fallen victim to as well.

Despite Xi’s insistence that his government was not behind the attack, everyone kind of knows he’s lying. After all, what good is the personal information of U.S. government employees and spies to corporations? While it’s clear that the federal government needs to ramp up their cyber security efforts, Paul Bonicelli blames President Obama’s foreign policy decisions that have weakened the United States’s global position. He writes:

The United States would have been better served by an OPM that was on its guard, but also by a posture in the world that warded off such unprecedented attacks. Every country that can spies in as sophisticated a way as possible, but for China to feel free to commit such an attack says a lot about how little it fears crossing the Obama administration.

Obama will get a chance to talk to Xi about the hack when the latter visits the White House on Friday, although if the past is any indicator, Obama will probably not bring any of this up.

Why Trevor Noah Is Wrong About Guns And Being Pro-Life,"So I guess we can forget about hearing any fresh or unique angles on The Daily Show. New host Trevor Noah recently argued that if pro-lifers truly cared about life, they could become superheroes for the cause by advocating for gun control. It’s an argument as worn out as it is misguided, exposing more about his progressive biases than his comedic prowess.

During the show, Noah offered this sentiment:

If pro-lifers would just redirect their powers toward gun violence, the amount of lives they would save would reach superhero levels. They just need to have a superhero’s total dedication to life. Because right now, they’re more like comic book collectors. Human life only holds value until you take it out of the package.

This tired liberal talking point demonstrates a false dichotomy between two main conservative ideals: saving the unborn and favoring the Second Amendment. “Imagine if we could bring some of that pro-life passion into being more, well, pro-life,” Noah said with a smirk.

The thing is, we don’t have to imagine — because pro-lifers are passionate about life—all life. They’re opposed to women killing their unborn infants because they believe in protecting innocent life. Certainly they don’t support the criminal actions of mass shooters. They’re in favor of legal gun possession because they believe in protecting innocent life. These two scenarios aren’t at odds. In fact, they are quite consistent.

Guns Save Lives

Vox weighed in on Noah’s comments, contending that while “Noah’s pro-life argument is unfair to pro-gun conservatives […] the facts on gun violence are, broadly speaking, on Noah’s side: More restrictions on guns would save lives.” This might come as a surprise to Noah—and sorry to disappoint, Vox—but guns save more lives than they take.

Vox goes on to say, “The fault of Noah’s critique of pro-life conservatives who oppose gun control lies in the fact that they don’t believe gun control can save lives. In fact, many gun rights advocates genuinely believe that gun control can get people killed–since without guns, they won’t be able to, for instance, defend themselves from home invaders.”

Essentially, Vox says Noah’s observation is flawed… but only because he doesn’t get that conservatives (erroneously) think gun control endangers lives.

Data from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics show us that guns are the safest and most effective means of self-defense. Their use results in fewer injuries to the defender and is safer than not resisting at all. Gun Owners of America calculated that every year firearms are used more than 80 times more often to protect the lives of innocent citizens than to take lives.

Of the millions of citizens who have guns, most don’t even fire the weapon at their attacker. They merely brandish the gun or fire a warning shot.

Of the millions of citizens who have guns, most don’t even fire the weapon at their attacker. They merely brandish the gun or fire a warning shot. Less than 8 percent of the time does a gun owner kill or wound an attacker when confronted. Armed citizens kill more criminals in the act of protecting themselves and their loved ones than do the police (1,527 to 606). According to Newsweek, only two percent of civilian shootings involved an innocent person, compared to the police error rate, which is five times as high.

According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California, a state with some of the strongest gun-control laws, had the highest number of gun murders in 2011. Compare that to Texas, which had nearly half the number of gun murders as California. Washington DC, which has strict gun-control laws, also has a high gun murder rate and finished first in gun-related robberies per 100,000 people.

Politico recently ran a long piece written by two gun-control advocates arguing that defensive gun ownership was a myth. But Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at Florida State University, offered a strong retort, most importantly pointing out that data consistently indicates that Americans underreport crime victimization experiences, gun ownership and their own criminal activity. We probably don’t even know the full extent guns help us defend life.

Guns Save Unborn Babies’ Lives, Too

Noah said that if pro-lifers cared about saving even one life they’d favor gun control—but obviously he doesn’t understand how lives are saved, both inside and outside the womb. When two men broke into her home, a Tennessee woman who was pregnant at the time grabbed a 12-gauge shotgun and pointed it at the men. They immediately ran, and she didn’t even have to fire a shot. That’s what being pro-life and pro legal gun possession looks like.

In Mobile, Alabama, a woman who was six months pregnant held an armed home invader at shotgun-point until the police arrived. Another life was saved in Roswell, New Mexico, when an 87-year-old man used his gun to stop a violent attacker from attempting to sexually assault a pregnant woman. In Indiana last year, intruders attempted to invade a pregnant woman’s home, but her life and her unborn child’s life was saved when her boyfriend shot and killed one of the intruders, before that intruder could join the other in fleeing.

Being pro-life and pro legal gun possession are not mutually exclusive nor are they at odds with one another.

Another example of a gun saving lives is the mother who defended herself and her two children when a man broke into their home in Loganville, Georgia. She and her nine-year-old twins hid in a crawlspace, which the intruder eventually located. When he opened the door, he found himself staring at a .38 revolver. The woman fired all six rounds and fled with the kids. Amazingly, the man fled the house and survived. It turned out he was a serial criminal and had been arrested six times.

This Oklahoma mother had just lost her husband to cancer when she shot and killed an intruder to protect her three-month-old baby. What would have happened to those mothers and children had they not had guns to defend themselves? Does Noah even care? (Oh, and here are some more examples of how guns save lives, if Noah needs more evidence.)

Being pro-life and pro legal gun possession are not mutually exclusive nor are they at odds with one another. In fact, they are morally, legally, and ideologically intertwined, working in tandem to protect innocent lives, in different ways, both offensively and defensively.

Without the right to defend oneself with force, law-abiding Americans would be as defenseless as a newborn—incapable of defending themselves, looking only to the state to prevent harm. That’s the world Trevor Noah wants us to live in. It’s not the world most of America wants.

U.S. Embassy In Tripoli Urged Clinton’s State Dept. To Stop Falsely Blaming Video for Benghazi Attack,"A newly released email from Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State shows that the United States embassy in Tripoli, Libya, begged the State Department to stop falsely claiming an inflammatory video played a role in the attack on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012.

In the days immediately after the Benghazi attack, Clinton and other Obama administration officials frequently claimed that protests over an inflammatory video led to the deaths of four Americans. While Clinton was privately communicating to family members and foreign officials that the compound had been attacked by Al Qaeda-linked elements, her public statements focused on the video. In the hours after the attack, she said:

“Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet,” Clinton said. “The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.”

A few days later, at a “Transfer of Remains Ceremony to Honor Those Lost in Attacks in Benghazi, Libya,” she said:

This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We’ve seen the heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We’ve seen rage and violence directed at American embassies over an awful internet video that we had nothing to do with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because it is senseless, and it is totally unacceptable.

During this time, talking points were rewritten by Obama Administration officials to give the impression that spontaneous protests over a video — and not a sophisticated pre-planned attack at an under-secured American facility — were to blame. That political spin was causing problems back in Libya, according to a newly released email from U.S. embassy in Tripoli. The email urged political officials in DC to be more “cautious” and stated that the video was “not as explosive of an issue here as it appears to be in other countries in the region.” The email, redacted in parts, says:

“Colleagues, I mentioned to [redacted] this morning, and want to share with all of you, our view at Embassy Tripoli that we must be cautious in our local messaging with regard to the inflammatory film trailer, adapting it to Libyan conditions. Our monitoring of the Libyan media and conversations with Libyans suggest that the films [sic] not as explosive of an issue here as it appears to be in other countries in the region. The overwhelming majority of the FB comments and tweets we’ve received from Libyans since the Ambassador’s death have expressed deep sympathy, sorrow, and regret. They have expressed anger at the attackers, and emphasized that this attack does not represent Libyans or Islam. Relatively few have even mentioned the inflammatory video. So if we post messaging about the video specifically, we may draw unwanted attention to it. And it is becoming increasingly clear that the series of events in Benghazi was much more terrorist attack than a protest which escalated into violence,” the official continued. It is our opinion that in our messaging, we want to distinguish, not conflate, the events in other countries with this well-planned attack by militant extremists. I have discussed this with [redacted] and he shares PAS’s view.”

Clinton continued to participate in a public narrative emphasizing the video while privately focusing on terrorism. See, for example, this write-up of a phone call confirming terrorists were responsible for the attack in which she tells the Egyptian Prime Minister that the video “had nothing to do with it.”

Her own email correspondence shows that Clinton had two different stories surrounding the cause of the Benghazi attack from day one. Under her leadership, the State Department pushed out a false, and politically advantageous, narrative to the American people blaming an internet video, while privately acknowledging that the events in Benghazi were purely motivated by terrorism.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/10/31/u-s-embassy-in-tripoli-urged-clintons-state-dept-to-stop-falsely-blaming-video-for-benghazi-attack/,2015-10-31
Don’t Let Paris Terror Attacks End The French Way Of Life,"Back in 1995, it wasn’t uncommon to see people practice a ritual before sitting down in the subway in Paris. They would look under their seat to make sure there was no bag left unattended. In July of that year, a bomb had exploded at the Saint-Michel subway station (in the heart of the Latin Quarter, close to the Sorbonne and Notre Dame) leaving eight dead and more than 100 injured. Parisians had reasons to fear for their lives. This was one of several attacks targeting France at the time, and linked to the Algerian civil war. I remember well—I had just started attending the Sorbonne that year.

Paris has faced many other attacks in the past decades, including several targeting the Jewish community. In a notorious 1982 attack, gunmen threw a grenade and started shooting at diners at the Goldenberg restaurant, rue des Rosiers in the Marais, killing six and injuring 22. More than 30 years later, the same method would be used in some of last Friday’s attacks.

The November 13, 2015, shootings, bombings, and hostage situation add to a list of Islamist terror attacks on Paris, which include the shooting of the editorial team of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and the hostage situation in a kosher grocery store last January.

As I’m writing these words, reports say at least 129 people died and more than 350 were wounded in last Friday’s attacks; 99 people are still in critical condition. Terrorists all carried powerful rifles and suicide bomb vests, which they did not hesitate to detonate. Not only were those attacks the most deadly Paris has known in the past decades, they are likely to tremendously impact the way of life of Parisians and French people in the months to come.

The Terrorists Chose Specifically French Targets

Even though I have made America and Texas, in particular, my home, my heart broke into pieces at the news. The place where I grew up, went to university, and started working was under attack again, and of the most vicious kind.

The November 13 attacks targeted activities that are dear to Parisians, symbols of the French joie de vivre.

In their statement claiming responsibility for the attacks, ISIS declared targets were carefully chosen in advance. In fact, while the Charlie Hebdo attack aimed to suppress free speech, the November 13 attacks targeted activities that are dear to Parisians, symbols of the French joie de vivre: restaurants where diners were enjoying food and drinks on a Friday night, a soccer game (soccer is France’s favorite sport), and a legendary Parisian concert venue.

The attacks were obviously meant to make as many victims as possible and to change the way the French would go about their life. French President Francois Hollande started this by asking Parisians to stay home. But his recommendation was probably not necessary.

A French friend informed me that her family was okay, but had canceled everything they had planned. A book signing my mother wanted to attend on Saturday was canceled due to terrorist threats. Public libraries and museums have remained closed following the events (how symbolic that access to knowledge would be impacted). The Eiffel Tower is also closed. Some shopping centers were getting ready to reopen on some Sundays—a huge issue in France. Canceled, too. Stores remained mostly closed on Sunday.

We are all getting ready to start the holiday shopping season, and Paris is particularly crowded this time of the year. Parisian department stores are well-known for their delightful Christmas windows. I’m afraid there will be nothing delightful about this holiday season. This, too, will be disrupted.

I’m afraid there will be nothing delightful about this holiday season. This, too, will be disrupted.

The impact on the Parisian psyche manifested on Sunday, when crowds that had gathered around memorials suddenly dispersed after sounds similar to shootings created panicked reactions.

By definition, terrorism is meant to create a state of fear in the population. Economically, this is not good for France, of course, which is already struggling to reach an estimated 1.1 percent growth rate for 2015. More worrisome is how the country might be politically impacted by the attacks. The temptation to turn to populist voices may be easy. Although the next presidential election will take place in 2017, results from regional elections next month might give us a hint (supposing people will go out to vote). Marine Le Pen’s far-right Front National Party might end up gaining more support following the events.

Mourn, Then Take Action

What can be done, then?

The French should first give themselves time to mourn their dead. Three days of national mourning started on Sunday, November 15. Emotional reactions to the attacks should then be followed by serious questioning about the effectiveness of several policies.

Emotional reactions to the attacks should then be followed by serious questioning about the effectiveness of several policies.

There are times in life when one wishes to be wrong. Sadly, I can’t say we did not see these attacks coming. Not only had ISIS warned France several times, but it is no secret that some areas of France, and some suburbs of Paris, have become fertile breeding ground for Islamization of young people and weapons trafficking. This problem should be addressed without having to play contortionist to avoid hurting the feelings of anyone.

France has very restrictive speech laws. Forbid people to engage in open debate, and unscrupulous politicians will exploit fears. Open debate would bring additional ideas, probably good and bad, on how to better fight the enemy we are facing. Anyone who opposes the attacks should be able to understand that. To use a popular expression these days, the victims of the attacks received no trigger warnings (no pun intended) before being executed in cold blood. Censoring fears will not help.

A good example would start with debating allowing the French to be able to carry guns to defend themselves and their loved ones, if necessary. Do we need further evidence that strict gun laws do not prevent criminals from obtaining deadly weapons to commit their crimes? The police will never be able to react soon enough to all dangerous situations, not to mention cases like Friday’s attacks, in which the goal is to kill as many people as possible. Someone carrying a gun might not have stopped the attacks, but the death toll might have been reduced. After the November 13 attacks, the French deserve to at least have the opportunity to debate whether gun control has made their livee safer.

It is no secret that some areas of France have become fertile breeding ground for Islamization of young people and weapons trafficking.

Finally, although easier said than done, the French should go back to fully living their lives the way they intend to. I realize this will take time, which is perfectly normal, but I know that in the end they will.

It has been reported that supporters of the Islamic State have been cheering on Twitter about how “Paris is burning.” Paris has been reported burning before, but Paris, with the help of its allies, fought back and always managed to come out free and victorious, celebrating its renewed freedom with good food, wine, and by having fun. After all, Paris’ motto is “Fluctuat nec mergitur,” or “tossed by the waves but not sinking.”

When I left France four years ago, the practice of checking underneath your seat in the subway was long gone. Once again, let’s not let the enemy win.

ISIS Is A Storm We May Not Weather,"Once again, Islamist terrorism has reached out and wreaked havoc in the West. On Friday night, ISIS gunmen and suicide bombers took the lives of 129 men and women and injured hundreds more. In the midst of this horror, President Francoise Hollande declared a territory-wide state of emergency and closed France’s borders. This is the second state of emergency called in the French hexagon since 1945, indicating the severity of the situation, as well as the government’s uncertainty about how to contain it.

Sadly, though, France is no stranger to terrorist attacks. The Armed Islamic Group (one of the main insurgent groups in the Algerian civil war) was responsible for the 1994 hijacking of Air France flight 8969, and bombings in 1995 and 1996 that killed more than a dozen and injured hundreds.

These attacks were extensions of the ongoing civil war in Algeria, something that separates them from the more recent model of Islamist terrorism in France. They were perpetrated by Algerians in the context of France’s colonial past and the still-bitter memory of the Algerian war for independence. Their motivations were largely political and easily identifiable.

The new model of terrorism, which includes Mohammed Merah’s killing spree in Toulouse (2012), three separate incidences involving a stabbing and vehicle rammings by men yelling “allahu akbar” (2014), and the Charlie Hebdo massacre (January 2015), has more to do with religious fervor than political goals.

It is a new kind of enemy that France, along with the rest of the world, faces. It’s a threat that doesn’t belong to just one country or nationality, but rather is united in global militant Islamism. Because of this, it is far more dangerous.

Did Charlie Hebdo Teach Us Nothing?

Friday’s attack comes just ten months after Islamists gunned down employees at the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo for publishing images of Mohammed. Afterward, there was international outpouring of sympathy with the twitter hash tag #jesuischarlie (“I am Charlie”) saturating social media.

People became more concerned with fighting Islamaphobia than with fighting radical Islam.

Yet those sentiments were quickly put aside in the name of tolerance. People became more concerned with fighting Islamaphobia than with fighting radical Islam. When Charlie Hebdo won the PEN freedom of speech award, several prominent authors boycotted, citing the publication’s “cultural intolerance” toward Islam.

What makes this weekend’s atrocity especially upsetting is the feeling that it could perhaps have been avoided. Perhaps if, upon the genuine emotional outpouring after the Charlie Hedbo massacre, people had then thought seriously about its causes and been willing to face the real threat of ISIS, maybe if they hadn’t so quickly taken refuge in the politically correct rhetoric of Islamaphobia, as President Obama did, if we weren’t all so afraid of offending, some of these lives might have been saved. It feels like the writing was on the wall.

We’re Deliberately Not Getting the Message

This is not to say that the French government has done nothing. After Charlie Hebdo, they passed a massive surveillance bill giving them more powers to monitor French citizens. They also joined United States-led aerial bombings of ISIS after intelligence emerged that Muslim French men were being recruited to train with ISIS, not to fight with them in the Middle East, but explicitly to return home to carry out attacks.

Muslim French men were being recruited to train with ISIS, not to fight with them in the Middle East, but explicitly to return home to carry out attacks.

However, what persisted after Charlie Hebdo, and what continues to plague the Western world, is a paralyzing level of political correctness that prevents us from naming the real problem. For all the hand wringing and hashtags, the denial continued.

Our supposed solidarity with those who were killed was only a knee-jerk, albeit well-intentioned, reaction to the tragedy. People weren’t willing to go further and commit intellectually to the idea that there is a problem with militant Islam. Instead, the insistence that Islam was being “hijacked” drowned out the fact that groups like ISIS have just as much of a “right” to claim Islam as their religion as the many peaceful Muslims around the world do.

Within hours of the Paris attack on Friday, people had changed their Facebook photos to show solidarity with France. Monuments around the world were lit up in red, white, and blue. There was a brief moment of hope while watching the terror unfold that this time things would be different. That there would be no defense of the terrorists’ actions because this time the victims were people who had made no provocation or political statement. That this time, perhaps, it would be harder for people to make excuses. They couldn’t turn away from the reality of our world in the twenty-first century: radical Islam is real, they truly believe what they do is their religious duty, and they aren’t going to stop.

Yet, less than 24 hours after the attacks, the top-trending hashtag on Twitter was “Muslims are not terrorists.” Somehow that became the main takeaway from the horror. Not the dozens dead, or their mourning families. Not the motives of the killers or their affiliation with a group that strictly interprets and enforces Sharia law.

We Can’t Fight What We Won’t See

The media was appallingly quick to run to Islam’s defense. Salon published a piece Saturday morning titled “Our terrorism double standard: After Paris, let’s stop blaming Muslims and take a hard look at ourselves.” Before the dead were counted, or the families and friends notified, before anyone had much time to process the scale and sophistication of the attacks and what they portend for the future, the sentry had stepped forward to proclaim that this is a problem not with any sect of Islam, but with us, the contemptible West. ISIS is openly calling the Paris attack the “first of the storm” while we’re fretting over whether this might give Islam a bad image.

ISIS is openly calling the Paris attack the ‘first of the storm’ while we’re fretting over whether this might give Islam a bad image.

The point is not that all Muslims are suspect or that monolithic Islam is to blame. Nor that countries should unilaterally shut down immigration from Syria and Iraq. But neither should we avoid talking about the violent and radical sects that do exist within Islam and that have as their explicit goal attacking the West, whose way of life they so despise. We cannot ignore that at least one of the attackers got to France via Greece with other migrants from Syria, and that this could be a real source of terrorist infiltration.

We must be able to name our enemies. How can we possibly “destroy and degrade” ISIS if we don’t even acknowledge their motivations? At the Democratic Party primary debate Saturday night, Hillary Clinton repeatedly refused to say “radical Islam,” opting for the euphemistic “jihadi terrorism” instead.

Even Charlie Hebdo fell prey to this thinking this weekend. In a cartoon, they discussed the importance of naming one’s enemies, and in the next breath said our enemies are “those who love death.” Certainly. But in this case, that moniker belongs to militant Islam.

Everyone Doesn’t Want Peace

While the attacks were still in progress, Obama declared them an attack on “all of humanity” and the “universal values we share.” He, like many others, mistakenly thinks that everyone fundamentally wants peace and love and acceptance and tolerance. He lacks the imagination (or the historical knowledge) to see that people don’t all share the same values.

This world isn’t an ivory tower utopia. In the real world, people sometimes believe in something so fervently that they’re willing to do great violence.

We need to understand the values that ISIS and its followers around the world genuinely hold, and which are rooted in their interpretation of Islam. Putting a French flag filter over your Facebook picture is well-intentioned, but almost entirely meaningless, because for most people it is a hollow pledge of solidarity. Without letting go of our fear of offending, and opening up an honest and uncomfortable conversation about the serious and real threats of militant Islamism, we will not weather this storm.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/11/16/isis-is-a-storm-we-may-not-weather/,2015-11-16
Obama On ISIS: I'm Not Interested In 'America Winning',"During a press conference detailing his administration’s strategy to destroy ISIS following several devastating terrorist attacks in Paris, President Barack Obama said he’s not interested in “pursuing some notion of American leadership or America winning[.]”

Obama’s remarks came several days after ISIS attacks in Paris that killed over 120 people and injured scores of others. Friday night’s attacks on France are believed to be the deadliest terrorist attacks in the country’s history.

“What I’m not interested in doing is posing or pursuing some notion of ‘American leadership’ or ‘America winning”’ –POTUS



Hugh Hewitt (@hughhewitt) November 16, 2015

Throughout Monday’s press conference, Obama insisted that his strategy for defeating ISIS was working and did not need to change. On Friday, just hours before the deadly Paris attacks, the president insisted in a television interview with ABC News that his administration had “contained” ISIS.

Obama’s tone during Monday’s press conference alternated between defensive and disinterested. The two-term Democratic president repeatedly insisted that his strategy was working and scoffed at demands to change his plan to confront and defeat ISIS.

“What I’m not interested in doing is posing or pursuing some notion of American leadership or America winning or whatever other slogans they come up with that has no relationship to what is actually going to work to protect the American people and to protect the people in the region who are getting killed and to protect our allies and people like France,” Obama said. “I’m too busy for that.”

To prove that he was on top of the terrorist threat, Obama noted that he regularly meets with his national security team to review and respond to ongoing threats against the U.S.

“Every few weeks I meet with my entire National Security team,” Obama told the crowd of reporters.

Towards the end of the press conference, Obama shifted away from ISIS and targeted Republicans instead. He specifically attacked Senators Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) for opposing Obama’s policy of allowing refugees from Syria to enter the U.S. The latest intelligence out of France suggests that at least one of the attackers responsible for Friday’s terrorist attacks in Paris entered Europe as a refugee from Syria.

Paris Attacks Reveal U.S. Campus Protesters’ Utter Delusion,"In the wake of the terrorist attacks Friday night in Paris that left 129 dead and hundreds wounded, we can safely say the U.S. student protesters’ 15 minutes of fame are over. The protests, which began at the University of Missouri and Yale and quickly spread to other schools drawing national media coverage, were always quixotic, seemingly conjured out of thin air.

Vague accusations that minority students are systematically oppressed carried demands for “safe spaces” and an end to “microaggressions,” as if American college campuses today are enclaves of the Jim Crow South. Throw in calls for student debt forgiveness, free tuition, and a $15-an-hour minimum wage for all college employees, and you more or less had a series of Bernie Sanders rallies on campuses from California to Massachusetts.

The Paris attacks, perpetrated by a violent global movement animated by a fanatical interpretation of Islam, have unmasked these students’ claims for what they are: the narcissistic phantoms of a coddled and privileged generation. Oppression and bigotry are real, but you won’t find much of it on our college campuses.

We’re So Oppressed By Frou Frou Facilities

Consider elite Amherst College. A group calling itself Amherst Uprising last week issued a statement and list of demands to address “the legacy of oppression on campus,” which has made students and faculty alike “victims of several injustices including but not limited to our institutional legacy of white supremacy, colonialism, anti-black racism,” and so on. Apparently minorities at Amherst, where tuition costs more than $63,700 a year, are suffering terribly under this historical yoke, and they demand redress.

The supposed oppression of minority students from Amherst to Mizzou appears to be for the most part nonexistent.

Further down their list of demands is a frank rejection of the First Amendment: the college president must issue a statement condemning those who put up posters that proclaimed “All Lives Matter” and “in memoriam of the true victim of the Missouri Protests: Free Speech.” These were deemed “racially insensitive” to minority students on campus, “who are victim to racial harassment and death threats.” In turn of phrase worthy of the Cultural Revolution, those responsible for the offensive posters must be “required to attend extensive training for racial and cultural competency.”

But are minority students at Amherst and other schools really victims of “racial harassment and death threats”? So far, most of the protesters’ claims of discrimination have been unsubstantiated or, in the case of the infamous poop swastika at Mizzou, not at all what it first appeared to be. (In an ironic twist, an Amherst faculty member associated with the Black Lives Matter movement issued death threats on social media against a local city council candidate in August, which police took seriously but the college defended as the exercise of free speech.)

In reality, the supposed oppression of minority students from Amherst to Mizzou appears to be for the most part nonexistent—at best aspirational. But little wonder that if you’re taught to see racial injustice everywhere, you’ll find it anywhere: rumors of black students being turned away from a Halloween frat party, an innocuous reference to fitting the “CMC mold” (for which Claremont McKenna College’s dean of students was forced to resign), or some yokel driving by flying a Confederate flag. Such is the weight of “systematic oppression” on American college campuses today.

Let’s Talk About Real Aggression

Compare these microaggressions to the macroaggression unleashed on unsuspecting Parisians. For the terrorists who slaughtered concertgoers and bombed the soccer stadium, bigotry and hatred and oppression are not theoretical playthings but vital parts of a demented religious creed.

College students willing to shut down their schools and demand resignations over Halloween costumes and rumors of racial insensitivity can’t even distinguish between microaggressions and terrorism.

Issuing a statement of its own in the wake of the attacks, ISIS claimed responsibility, calling the 89 people killed at the Bataclan theatre “apostates [who] had gathered in a profligate prostitution party.” Of the terrorists, ISIS boasted, “Allah conquered through their hands and cast in the hearts of the Crusaders horror in the middle of their land.” The attacks were a retaliation for France’s role in “the Crusader campaign” in Syria, and “the first of the storm and a warning to those who wish to learn.”

College students willing to shut down their schools and demand resignations over Halloween costumes and rumors of racial insensitivity are unable to recognize the face of true bigotry. They can’t even distinguish between microaggressions and terrorism. A surprisingly large number of Black Lives Matter activists took to social media over the weekend to complain either that the carnage on Paris would steal their media spotlight or that Mizzou and Paris were equivalent. Said one typical post: “Look at all the racists on Twitter using the Paris tragedy to discredit the Black Lives Matter movement at home.”

It’s no surprise, then, that many college students can’t even bring themselves to honor the victims of terrorism. Three days before the Paris attacks, the undergraduate student government at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities rejected a resolution calling for a campus-wide moment of recognition on future anniversaries of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

“The passing of this resolution might make a space that is unsafe for students on campus even more unsafe,” said David Algadi, the university’s director of Diversity and Inclusion. “Islamophobia and racism fueled through that are alive and well.”

The students and sympathetic college administrators behind the protests, like many in the media, will no doubt conclude—as many of them already have—that the greatest thing we have to fear in the wake of the attacks is Islamophobia. The same delusion that makes them see racism and oppression everywhere also induces a fear of a backlash against Muslims that never comes.

The protesters are correct in exactly one sense: hatred and bigotry and violent oppression are alive and well in the world. But you won’t find much evidence of it on America’s college campuses. For those with eyes to see, you don’t have to look any further than the streets of Paris.

The Crisis Is Islam,"Why is it that so many of the same people who are skeptical about exporting liberalism (count me as one) are perfectly content with the idea of importing illiberalism?

Even as the terrorist attacks in Paris were happening, a predictable debate broke out over the millions of Islamic refugees now pouring into the West from the Arab world. We were once again asked to pretend that Islamic terrorism materializes in a vacuum that has absolutely nothing to do with theological beliefs of the majority of people in the Middle East and thus nothing to do with brutality and oppression that prevail in the region.

One of the most common talking points regarding refugees has been this:

This tragedy should make us sympathetic to refugees fleeing these murderers, not angry at them: https://t.co/ok8Gg0tApD

— Ezra Klein (@ezraklein) November 14, 2015

From the Vox piece:

Again, we still don’t know who’s to blame for the Paris attacks, whether a jihadist group was involved, or the motives involved. But if a jihadist group is the culprit, these kinds of terrorist organizations are exactly the kind of danger that many Syrian refugees are fleeing from. It is ISIS, after all, that has terrorized so much of Syria — and forced people to flee their homes to avoid violence.

This kind of emotional appeal avoids some very inconvenient facts. For starters, it looks like at least one of the attackers was a been (update: or posed) as a refugee from Syria. Put another way: he was a terrorist posing as a refugee — one of the most potent arguments refugee opponents offered.

Whatever the case, it’s true that most refugees are fleeing genuine and horrifying violence. But it is also true that many refugees bring with them — through their culture, ideology, and faith — the same conditions that bred the violence in the first place. It has nothing to do with what immigrants “look” like or how many superb and moral Muslims there are in the world (because there are many) and everything to do with what these refugees believe.

Many refugees bring with them — through their culture, ideology, and faith — the same conditions that bred the violence in the first place.

The vast majority of Muslims aren’t terrorists, but in the contemporary world nearly all movements and ideas that produce political terrorism are birthed in Islamic communities that house mostly peaceful people. Mass immigration bolsters those communities with hundreds of thousands of new, unassimilated adherents in the middle of secular nations with belief systems that grate against Islamic worldview. How can Europe not expect some of them will embrace the radicalism and fundamentalism adopted to some extent in nearly every other major Islamic community?

It doesn’t only manifest in terrorism, but in the medievalism of whippings, mass hangings, stoning, and violent misogyny and bigotry — not just mean words.

The tragedy of Syria should make us sympathetic to the plight of refugees fleeing murderers, but that doesn’t change the fact that — according to a Pew poll and every other reputable polling that’s been done on the topic — “overwhelming percentages of Muslims in many countries want Islamic law (sharia) to be the official law of the land.” The losers of civil war are victims, but that doesn’t mean they have liberal values. When the Arab world has been granted the right to vote, it almost always backs religious extremism. It votes for Hamas and for the Muslim Brotherhood. ISIS and Shia terror groups aren’t funded by Kickstarter; they are partly funded by forces in Gulf States, Iran, and throughout the Islamic world.

As long as Muslims say IS has nothing to with Islam or talk of Islamophobia they are not ready to reform their faith. — Ayaan Hirsi Ali (@Ayaan) November 15, 2015

Here at home, the restraints of feigned tolerance make debating this issue seem like we’re living in kindergarten circle time. When John Dickerson asked the Democratic candidates if they would use the words “radical Islam” at the presidential debate on Saturday to describe the enemy, not one of them would do so. Like the two presidents before them, Democrats now function in a fantastical alternative reality where every denomination is equally decent (other than, perhaps, orthodox Christians here in U.S.) and all of humanity share the same values and the same dreams.

“This is an attack not just on Paris, it’s an attack not just on the people France, but this is an attack on all of humanity and the universal values we share,” Barack Obama explained after the attacks. All of humanity? No, it was an attack by fundamental Islam against Europeans. Just like 9/11 was an attack against the United States, stabbing civilians in the streets of Israel was an attack against Jews, and the Charlie Hebdo massacre was an attack against free expression.

The losers of civil war are victims, but that doesn’t mean they have liberal values.

When there is a deadly bombing in Beirut or horrifying assaults on civilian populations in Iraq or Syria, it is part of an ongoing factional religious war. This is not some ideology disconnected from all others that visits from outer space every few days to kill humans randomly. Yet, many of the same people who argue that ISIS was created by George Bush and climate change will also tell you that the group has nothing to do with Islam. It’s about economics. It’s about blowback. It’s about poverty. It’s about anything and everything but the theological war that’s actually going on.

None of this is to say Muslims can never assimilate in the West. The U.S., for the most part, proves the opposite. But there is nothing bigoted about being vigilant when embracing millions of new people who bring all kinds of illiberal baggage with them. If, as Ayaan Hirsi Ali says, we keep pretending this has nothing to do with Islam, we will never actually talk about the problem. There are many good Muslims, but if that’s the only criteria, no one will be able to be critical of any theology or ideology ever again.

16 Of The Worst Ways To Respond To ISIS’ Paris Attack,"Under President Francois Hollande, the French began their military and legal response to the horrific terror attacks that hit Paris on Friday. ISIS, which took responsibility for the terrorism, threatened the United States that it could be next.

In a video released on Monday, an ISIS fighter says, “I swear to God, as we struck France in its stronghold Paris, we will strike America in its stronghold, Washington.”

CIA director John Brennan said it is obvious that ISIS has an “external agenda” to carry out attacks outside of Syria, is engaged in careful planning toward that end, and that Paris was not the only operation that the group has in the pipeline.

Here are some of the misguided ways various people have responded to the threats posed by ISIS.

1) Obama’s Press Conference

President Obama made some brief comments on the evening of the attacks. “We stand prepared and ready to provide whatever assistance the people of France need to respond,” he said. Also, “This is an attack on all of humanity and the universal values we share.” He didn’t explain which universal values he was referring to or how the attacks occurred if the values are, in fact, universal. The attacks took place the day after Obama said ISIS, a group he once dismissed as the “JV” team, was being contained. ISIS had also just taken responsibility for bombing Beirut and downing a Russian jet.

He also addressed the situation at a press conference at the G20 summit in Turkey on Monday. In both encounters with the press, Obama seemed subdued. In Monday’s, he became righteously angry only when talking about Republicans who oppose his policies.

This was an unfortunate posture to take since he had a profoundly important task of trying to sell Americans on the idea that not much would change about U.S. attempts to fight ISIS while also telling other countries to do more. He haltingly discussed how he always knew it would take a long time to fight ISIS and that what happened in Paris was a “setback.” He said that other countries need to “step up” their resources, share more information, and strengthen their border controls. He also said the U.S. was showing how to take refugees from the conflict in Syria while also ensuring security of the country. These aren’t necessarily bad approaches to take, but he said all this while showing very little emotion or interest. It went over like a lead balloon.

Instead of assuring or reassuring Americans that the refugee program has good security controls, Obama conveyed precisely the opposite.

Instead of assuring or reassuring Americans that the refugee program has good security controls, he conveyed precisely the opposite. By the end of the day, some 26 governors had publicly said refugees couldn’t relocate to their states unless and until security concerns were addressed.

But even the press seemed shocked at Obama’s curiously detached, professorial posture. The first reporter asked, “The equation has clearly changed. Isn’t it time for your strategy to change?” The next question was, “Have you underestimated their abilities?” The next question asked whether Obama’s strategy “makes the United States weaker and emboldens our enemies.” That was followed by, “Why can’t we take out these bastards?” And the next reporter asked him if he was even concerned about ISIS before asking, “Do you think you really understand this enemy well enough to defeat them and to protect the homeland?”

When the press, which no objective observer would call hostile to the president, is asking questions such as these, it should be a wake-up call to Obama about the need to at least act like he takes the problem more seriously. Instead he responded with defensiveness and derision.

I actually support much of Obama’s strategy, as stated in this press conference, for dealing with ISIS. And yet rather than selling the idea that this was a strategy that would result in the best possible outcome, he sounded an almost defeatist tone as he claimed a lack of interest in notions of victory. When part of your foreign policy strategy is avoidance of another messy land war, it is absolutely incumbent on you that you communicate why it’s the best possible path. Instead of that, this press conference probably did more to make people think that war is the only solution to ISIS and that the current foreign policy leadership has no idea what it’s doing.

2) All Renditions of “Imagine”

Peter Cook had a great conspiracy theory yesterday: “John Lennon did not write ‘Imagine.’ I think Yoko did, and that’s why it is so terrible.”

The day after Paris was attacked, a man rode up with a piano and began playing “Imagine” to a crowd of mourners. People really enjoyed this. Then Coldplay did a cover of the song.

There are so many problems with “Imagine” on a good day — the lyrics are embarrassingly juvenile as well as godless and communistic. But for the aftermath of an attack that hit people at soccer stadiums, restaurants and music venues, I’m not sure even the lyrics “Imagine all the people/Living for today” work. I mean, enjoying the evening was precisely what the murder victims in Paris were doing at the moment they were gunned down by murderous Islamist radicals.

Simply pick a better song that doesn’t make you seem like you are literally at Chris Martin levels of maturity.

3) Opining On “What ISIS Wants”

When journalists and pundits didn’t support a particular course of action, they began claiming that the opposite was what “ISIS wants,” as if this would be a really effective argument. A few samples (links here, here and here):

ISIS leaders are actually pretty straightforward about what they want. And if you want to read just one article that gets to the heart of who they are and why they exist, I’d recommend “What ISIS Really Wants” from Graeme Wood earlier this year in The Atlantic. It’s not perfect — toward the end it pooh-poohs the idea that ISIS fighters might want to bring the fight back to their home countries — but it does a good job of explaining their motivation and what they seek.

Wood explains that ISIS is committed “to returning civilization to a seventh-century legal environment, and ultimately to bringing about the apocalypse.” ISIS probably does want you to respond to their attacks by playing Yoko Ono tunes rather than killing them before they can strike again, but that in itself is not reason to avoid playing “Imagine.”

Germany sought war as part of its goals, but that wasn’t a reason to avoid entering World War II. Japan quite obviously provoked the U.S. into entering that same war when it bombed Pearl Harbor. The idea that our country should then have sat it out is also not a tenable argument. And questions about balancing security and humanitarian efforts are not something you toss out the window because ISIS has a policy position on the matter. We are far too advanced to fall for such silly lines of thinking.

Or as this Twitter user noted:

4) Saying ISIS Fears Peace Talks

Green Party foreign affairs spokesperson, Tony Clarke said: “The killing has to stop and world leaders must find a way forward that defeats ISIS using the weapon that these terrorists fear most of all, peace talks.”

Fact check: Not true. ISIS doesn’t fear peace talks at all. Have they not the faintest idea what ISIS even is? This Facebook post that went viral is a bit long but worth sharing.

5) So Much Stupidity in Discussions About Refugees

Millions of people have left Syria in search of better economic prospects or relief from the ongoing civil war. As discussed in “When Is A Refugee Really A Migrant?” there are differences between different groups of people. For refugees, you frequently see entire families leaving and both men and women leaving. For migrants seeking work, different patterns emerge. In the case of the current migrant/refugee crisis, more than 70 percent are adult males, and only about 15 percent are children. It’s unclear why the demographics are so overwhelmingly adult and male, but it’s something journalists and policy makers should be interested in answering, particularly as they position the crisis as one affecting refugees.

Related to this discussion, one of the terrorists in Paris had a Syrian passport with him that he used to come in — with refugees — to France and passed through five countries on his way there.

Obama has promised to take in 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year. Some Americans question whether the country’s security bureaucracy would protect against threats from eager ISIS terrorists. Americans are concerned about border security in general, even before wondering if the government can handle something as delicate as a resettlement program. As mentioned above, more than half of the country’s governors are expressing concern about the plan. In fact, only 14 percent of the states are still accepting Syrian refugees. Other Americans say that it’s the country’s humanitarian duty to welcome Syrians. To my mind, both concern for security of the country and for Syrians in need are understandable.

But people pretty much lost their minds when discussing the situation. Some GOP presidential candidates, such as Mike Huckabee and Chris Christie, went way overboard in expressing concerns about security. Others caricatured security concerns with a notable lack of charity:

I actually don’t know enough about how well the U.S. is prepared to handle security risks in refugee and migrant resettlements, although I have spoken to some federal agents whose lack of confidence in bureaucratic handling of the size and speed of the resettlement gives me pause. My heart bleeds for those in need and also for those victims whose countries failed to protect them from exploitation of the refugee crisis. I can’t stop thinking about the family members of all those many Parisians who were killed on Friday.

People seriously need to have a more mature conversation about the seriousness of the problem facing some refugees, the presence of a migrant population seeking economic relief, the reality of security threats, and the challenges of resettlement for both migrants and refugees. And it is the most obvious common sense out there to be concerned about security — that’s basically the first order of business for humans — and the media could really stop all the signaling and moral preening about how people concerned about security are monsters.

6) A Fake Passport Means Governors Are Wrong to Worry

So the Syrian passport used by one of the Paris terrorists appears to be fake, not that this kept its user from registering with it when he arrived with a group of refugees and traveling through various countries with it as he made his way to France.

A Daily Beast story by Michael Weiss and Justin Miller begins this way:

One of the Paris attackers was supposedly found with a Syrian passport—leading Republican governors here in America to vow to block Syrian refugees from entering their states.



But that passport was a fake, French officials told The Wall Street Journal, which means the governors’ freakout over refugees was likely based on a lie.

Later, they wrote:

Texas Gov. Gregg Abott also fell for the ISIS ruse.



“A Syrian ‘refugee’ appears to have been part of the Paris terror attack,” he wrote in a letter to the Obama administration on Monday.

I don’t know how this isn’t obvious to the folks at the Daily Beast, but the fact that ISIS appears to have intentionally and successfully exploited the refugee system to bust an agent into enemy territory only helps the arguments of those concerned about security and refugees. It’s not like the fakeness of the passport means that the terrorist is fake. He was all too real. And it doesn’t mean he didn’t come into enemy territory by claiming to be a refugee. He still did that. And even that Abott specifically scarequoted ‘refugee’ to point out that the terrorists wasn’t an actual refugee but one posing as such means that he didn’t fall for a “ruse.” This is really stupid analysis, in fact.

If people spent a bit of time understanding the arguments of their opponents, they’d understand that the concern isn’t that refugees are all terrorists waiting to attack but that terrorists could pose as refugees. As happened, apparently, in Paris.

7) Mocking People Concerned About Refugees and Security

As seen above, many progressives were mocking people concerned about security risks in light of mass migration and refugee resettlement. Perhaps the best example of this is a whopping 18-minute snarkfest from TV’s John Oliver, an entertainer on HBO.

He relentlessly mocks those who point out that refugee and migrant programs involve tradeoffs — thinking that the mention of appeals to unspecified authorities and jokes and signaling are sufficient retorts that destroy such arguments. The piece, which aired in late September, included the following line:

“And I know lots of people still have fears… fears that migrants might have an ISIS member lurking among them, which there has been no credible example of.”

This elicited the predictable response from partisans.

And when it turned out that such concerns weren’t just rational but realized? Well, moving right along.

8) Migrants Are This Close to Joining ISIS

One of the less successful arguments made by people who encourage more openness to quick migration is exemplified by this piece in the Washington Post headlined, of course, “The Islamic State wants you to hate refugees.”

The piece is very pro-refugee, but it implies that refugees are pretty close to joining ISIS and all it would take to nudge them there is a bit of a snub from Western governments. This is a horrible argument to make to people already concerned that refugees harbor a terrorist or might include people who are close to joining ISIS. This poll, for instance, shows that not-insignificant percentages of refugees have a favorable view of ISIS.

9) Downplaying the Evil of ISIS

This tweet from a Democratic candidate for the Minnesota House has been deleted and, in fact, the campaign has ended. That is probably for the best, as such moral relativism that excuses murderous ideologues who gun down women in cafes is reprehensible.

10) Global Warming Caused ISIS

Just no.

And yes, I know Bernie Sanders says similar things, but if you believe climate change caused ISIS, you are simply not a serious person.

11) Your Hot Gun Control Take

Terrorism isn’t a word meaning “bad thing.” It’s a specific word with a specific definition. So not all bad things are the exact same things as other bad things. Someone tell the Philadelphia mayor, though.

There’s pretending to not understand what motivates ISIS. Then there’s this, from Boston Globe columnist Michael Cohen.

12) A Sudden Interest in Not Politicizing Something

Last month a man fatally shot eight students and a professor at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. The president, his fellow Democratic politicians, and the media immediately politicized the shooting. And I do mean immediately. With bodies still warm, Obama said, “this is something we should politicize.” He asked the media to write stories comparing gun deaths to terrorism, and they did just that.

But in the face of a terrorist attack, many people changed their tune. Then, then, then vs. now. Then, then vs. now.

The idea that we can’t talk about the political implications or solutions to Islamic extremism but must demand gun control (always gun control, never other solutions) at each mass shooting is inconsistent.

13) This Has Nothing to Do With Islam

Pioneered by President George W. Bush, Americans and other leaders are fond of protecting Islam each and every time Muslim terrorists kill people. It is certainly wise to distinguish between different types of Muslims and to encourage and recognize the many Muslims who live in peace with their neighbors. It is also beyond silly how much we pretend the Islam practiced (in this case) by ISIS isn’t a major animating force.

Here was Michael Gerson’s version of the “What ISIS wants” meme that captivated so many pundits this week:

The problem is that ISIS is Islamic. To go back to The Atlantic article referenced above:

The reality is that the Islamic State is Islamic. Very Islamic. Yes, it has attracted psychopaths and adventure seekers, drawn largely from the disaffected populations of the Middle East and Europe. But the religion preached by its most ardent followers derives from coherent and even learned interpretations of Islam.



Could ISIS Exist Without Islam?



Virtually every major decision and law promulgated by the Islamic State adheres to what it calls, in its press and pronouncements, and on its billboards, license plates, stationery, and coins, “the Prophetic methodology,” which means following the prophecy and example of Muhammad, in punctilious detail. Muslims can reject the Islamic State; nearly all do. But pretending that it isn’t actually a religious, millenarian group, with theology that must be understood to be combatted, has already led the United States to underestimate it and back foolish schemes to counter it. We’ll need to get acquainted with the Islamic State’s intellectual genealogy if we are to react in a way that will not strengthen it, but instead help it self-immolate in its own excessive zeal.

14) This White House Talking Point

VOX may not be taken very seriously, but it’s worth remembering that it funnels White House talking points. So consider that this may be something the White House wishes were believed.

Nailed it!

15) Enthusiastic Late Night Hosts Aren’t an Actual Victory Strategy

People really enjoyed a few of the late night shows’ reactions to the Paris terror attacks.

Oh no he di’int! Suh-nap! That John Oliver is amazing. He just “destroyed” ISIS!

Oh wait, no. They’re still totally thriving and killing Parisians, beheading Christians, and raping women. I guess we’ll have to come up with another plan.

16) Atheist Biblesplaining

One of the hottest responses to the Parisian terror attacks was to not just stop talking about ISIS by talking about all the refugees you care about more than the other guy. And one of the most popular ways to do that was by referencing Mary and Joseph not finding a room at an inn when they traveled to Bethlehem for the census.

So this abortion enthusiast, for instance, offered:

An “ultra-liberal gay atheist university professor from Massachusetts” wondered “How many conservatives who now turn away desperate Middle-Easterners seeking refuge will soon be putting up a Nativity?” Shaun King quoted Leviticus, of all books of the Bible, to attempt to shame those concerned about protecting the security of their families and neighbors.

One satirical Twitter account explained the silliness of these tweets that spread with righteous indignation throughout social media.

Like you, I love being lectured about human decency by people who defend Planned Parenthood. But since when did liberals decide the Bible should be the basis of public policy? Imagine the implications for marriage law! Except it’s not that they want the Bible to be the basis of public policy. They want their facile and smorgasbord-like interpretation of the Bible to be the basis for public policy.

Loving your neighbor is both simple and complex. Preserving security is a form of loving your near neighbors. Welcoming the foreigner is a form of loving other neighbors. These are at times competing concerns, and Christian theologians have discussed what to do in times of conflict for thousands of years. Americans would do well to learn from those discussions.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/11/17/16-of-the-worst-ways-to-respond-to-isis-paris-attack/,2015-11-17
America’s Not Coming To Help France,"There’s a political cartoon on circulating the Internet after the coordinated terrorist attack on Paris. It’s of the Statue of Liberty, climbing down from her pedestal and looking across the Atlantic to a burning Paris and declaring, “I’m coming!”

Only she’s not. America will not go into the battle this time. Listen to the candidates, the media, the public. We have turned inward, to our comfortable isolationist soul, which we prefer despite our reputation for “meddling” abroad.

We are the people of whom John Quincy Adams once said:

Wherever the standard of freedom and Independence has been or shall be unfurled, there will [America’s] heart, her benedictions and her prayers be. But she goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator only of her own. She will commend the general cause by the countenance of her voice, and the benignant sympathy of her example. She well knows that by once enlisting under other banners than her own, were they even the banners of foreign independence, she would involve herself beyond the power of extrication, in all the wars of interest and intrigue, of individual avarice, envy, and ambition, which assume the colors and usurp the standard of freedom. The fundamental maxims of her policy would insensibly change from liberty to force…. She might become the dictatress of the world. She would be no longer the ruler of her own spirit.

We’ve Enabled Europe to Stop Defending Itself

The Marshall Plan, that massive investment in capital and defense we provided in the years after World War II, was a huge change for us. We wanted to avoid another world war, which we had to enter both times. It was expensive in every sense of the word. But everyone settled in. The western world relied on us after the Marshall Plan. We got used to the control. We became the world’s policeman and underwriter.

When the world demanded we leave and take our fighting nature with us, Europe was left vulnerable.

The European nations got used to social welfare states that they could afford since they did not need robust defense budgets. Over the years, they coddled their own citizens against the truth of world conflict, so when we walked away—or, let us be accurate, when the world demanded we leave and take our fighting nature with us—Europe was left vulnerable.

The nature of the threat was merely a detail. What was certain was that a threat would come. And it has. Even still, the danger had a hard time getting the world’s attention. After Paris on Friday, it has it.

A Weak Defense Invites Attack

When I saw the Statute of Liberty cartoon on Saturday, I wondered, can we really not see that Paris has a timeline, a context? For instance, many of the very same people now publicly calling for prayers for Paris and the support to France complained about our “arrogant” involvement previously. Do they really think America will fight? It is as if people in power believe that all terrible events strike randomly, like lightning, and that the lightning has nothing to do with the thunderclouds that bring it.

This attack did not come like lightning. None of this was surprising. President Bush warned us eight years ago. See above video. He tried to prepare us about seven years before that: “Americans should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign unlike any other we have ever seen.”

The Israelis know it. They released a video about fighting Europe’s war just last week. The peaceable people of the region have lived it. Many are now huddled and stranded, and no one seems to care. We are fretting about the refugees and mass migration into Europe and ignoring, like the good little politically correct acolytes we are, that most of those are adult males, not families. The threatened families are, well, dead or huddling in places like Jordan. For them we offered—what?

This Is Not Like September 11

If we do provide assistance, it will not be the precision, boots on the ground plans to avoid collateral damage. It will be messy.

Why has France acted so hastily? Fast and furious is the option they’ve got. An allied NATO campaign isn’t likely.

Already, just 48 hours later, France has been raining bombs down on Syria, supposedly on our intelligence—that’s the assistance we are likely to provide—while they are perhaps courting the Russians as allies.

The Russians are not known for military mercies. These will not be the meticulously planned precision strikes of the Afghan or Iraq campaigns in 2001 and 2003. Remember waiting a long month—wasn’t it five weeks—from the September 11 attacks to the launches against the Taliban? Or the months of delay for an eighteenth United Nations resolution against Saddam? Neither the French, nor the Russians, will likely feel it necessary to go through UN formalities.

Why has France acted so hastily? Fast and furious is the option they’ve got. An allied NATO campaign isn’t likely. As a policy wonk friend explained well on Saturday:

Let’s game out that hypothetical and likely never-to-happen [NATO] Article V call from France to the alliance: how do we think a White House that has bent over backwards to avoid a boots-on-the-ground commitment in the Muslim world, and also has repeatedly praised and affirmed the positive intrinsic qualities of that same milieu, would react to a request to commit an army on a punishment expedition to that sphere? The question answers itself: an American supportive commitment would almost certainly be limited to the existing mix of special forces and airpower, giving the French as much as we give the Kurds. This in turn is one big reason President Hollande is exceedingly unlikely to issue the call, as the things it exposes about the real state of the alliance and especially the will of its dominating partner would be exceedingly damaging.

I listened to the second Democratic debate—one that was hastily turned into a foreign policy, national security, and terrorism debate after the attacks on Paris—hoping to be surprised by some realistic analysis. My hopes were dashed. Even Vox knows the three candidates failed the Paris and ISIS questions.

Democratic Candidates Dither and Blame the Victims

Candidate Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of State for Obama’s first term and who should know the realities cold, said she wants more info so top people can think and analyze and come up with a plan sometime in the undefined future. Candidate Martin O’Malley wants basically the same thing. Candidate Bernie Sanders thinks it is all related to climate change. (Pause for a moment to honor the nerve it must take to say something so ridiculous to a national audience.)

ISIS is not powerful because of our invasion but because of our exit.

If that weren’t ridiculous enough, he also adheres to that noxious and naive argument that but for our invasion ten years ago, ISIS would not exist. This line of thinking smacks of blaming the victims—a argument vehemently protested in other contexts.

ISIS ideologies existed prior to 2003. We did not create them. ISIS’s predecessors exported terrorism then, too. They reign today because of our ill-advised, premature pull-out of the region. ISIS is not powerful because of our invasion but because of our exit.

But that is not the prevailing narrative now. Americans were already acting out of character before being berated for our actions and earnestly worrying if we had caused it all. We have little political will to fight absent another attack on us.

World War Déjà Vu

The hashtags might fly. The city skylines will glow in thick stripes of red, white, and blue. The politicians and so many others will publicly claim a prayer to a God that many of them don’t believe in. We will put on a good show of caring, but the harsh truth is, we aren’t coming.

Americans will not come to Europe’s aid until they are in chains or on their knees.

We remain at heart as our sixth president had described. Unless we elect one of the Cuban senators, Americans will not come to Europe’s aid until they are in chains or on their knees and we feel the threat on our own shores. Perhaps that will happen faster than in the past, but students of history know that is how this story goes.

“What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done, and there is nothing new under the sun. Is there a thing of which it is said, ‘See, this is new’? It has been already in the ages before us” (Ecclesiastes 1:9-10).

John Kerry: Charlie Hebdo Kind Of Asked For It You Know,"In remarks at the U.S. embassy in Paris on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry rationalized the terrorist attack against Charlie Hebdo last January, saying terrorists at least had an understandable reason for it. Kerry’s remarks, which were transcribed and made available online by the State Department, were intended to calm and encourage embassy staff and their families.

Kerry specifically drew a contrast between January’s attacks on Charlie Hebdo, a French satirical magazine, and the attacks that rocked Paris on Friday, killing more than 120 people and injuring scores of others.

“There’s something different about what happened from Charlie Hebdo, and I think everybody would feel that,” Kerry said. “There was a sort of particularized focus and perhaps even a legitimacy in terms of – not a legitimacy, but a rationale that you could attach yourself to somehow and say, okay, they’re really angry because of this and that.”

And how was that different than last week’s attacks throughout Paris?

“This Friday was absolutely indiscriminate,” he said. “It wasn’t to aggrieve one particular sense of wrong. It was to terrorize people.”

Kerry did not expand on why he thought murderous terrorist attacks with a “rationale”–for example, the desire to murder magazine cartoonists–were somehow less horrifying than the desire to kill indiscriminately. He also contradicted himself moments later, when he said Islamic terrorists target people for who they are and what they believe, while at the same time killing people indiscriminately.

“They kill people because of who they are and they kill people because of what they believe,” Kerry said. “And it’s indiscriminate.”

A former U.S. senator accustomed to debating complex issues at length in Congress, Kerry drew immediate fire online for his rationalization of the Hebdo attacks that killed 11 people in retaliation for drawing cartoons that radical Islamic jihadis believed were offensive.

How To Defeat ISIS,"In the wake of Paris attacks, we’ve been repeatedly told that ISIS is losing ground and that all we have to do is be patient until they topple under their own weight. But this is dead wrong. The ongoing conflict won’t be resolved by taking back land from ISIS or subduing them militarily. It’s a war of ideology, and we’re currently losing.

In his remarks at the U.S. embassy in Paris Tuesday, Secretary of State John Kerry insisted that embassy workers and their families should “hang in there” because we’ve made “progress.” He stated that over the past couple of months, ISIS lost about 22 percent of the geographic region it had previously controlled. To the Obama administration, that’s evidence our current strategy of containment is working.

Over the past few days, President Obama has repeatedly affirmed that deploying troops and declaring war against ISIS is unnecessary. Despite the terrorist attacks that took the lives of 129 people on Friday, Obama said we’ve been successful at beating ISIS back with drone strikes. Unfortunately, his assessment of the ongoing conflict misses the point entirely.

Beliefs Without Borders

Regaining territory from ISIS doesn’t really mean anything, as its goals are much bigger than gaining parcels of land. It aims to conquer the entire world. Mind you, its understanding of this isn’t restricted to the political sense; ISIS actually wants to annihilate everyone who doesn’t ascribe to its radicalized interpretation of the Quran.

The fight isn’t over land; it’s over the hearts and minds of people.

The beliefs fueling Islamic militants aren’t contained by borders. If anything, we’ve seen enough examples of Americans becoming radicalized via the Internet and joining their cause. The fight isn’t over land; it’s over the hearts and minds of people, not bound by lines on a map.

Indeed, no one is talking about the ground that we’ve won back from ISIS, yet everyone is talking about the horror that resulted in 129 casualties last week. Pretending that this is a war like other wars and using indicators of victory like death tolls and geographic advances is inaccurate, to say the least. The Paris attacks have made it painfully clear that this is a war of ideology, not geography.

ISIS Is Gaining Traction Within a Vacuum of Values

For years, our society has devalued the tenets of Western civilization and minimized our Christian heritage as much as possible. The only socially acceptable “values” that remain are tolerance and political correctness. Indeed, the irony of the Paris attacks occurring while American students protest on campuses across the country shouldn’t go unexamined. Students at Mizzou lost it at the sight of a poop swastika and called for the head of their university president after determining he was a threat to their stunted understanding of social justice.

We’re losing a common system of values and all that’s left are political correctness and an appreciation of selective tolerance.

Why were their actions so dogmatic? Why were they so willing to surrender portions of their freedom in the name of safety from dangerous ideas and mean words? Because, sadly, political correctness is the only value college students have in common. They’re willing to defend it vehemently because it’s the only thing they have left to fight for. And it is fragile. An offensive Halloween costume or a poop swastika is all that it takes to pose a serious threat to the values that American college students hold today.

We’ve chipped away at our foundational beliefs to the extent that very little remains at the root of our social and political thought. In our increasingly fragmented society, we’re losing a common system of values, and all that’s left are political correctness and an appreciation of selective tolerance.

The College Campus Is Now Ground Zero

Last week, professor Melissa Click threatened a student with mob violence because she felt that the freedoms afforded to him by the First Amendment infringed upon other students’ cries for the university to police student interactions — all in the name of political correctness.

To them, it’s reasonable to resent the ideological tradition from which the Constitution stems.

Earlier this month, an undercover video showed a student activist telling university administrators and college professors that the Constitution was “triggering.” By and large, the responses were either to shred the document or agree that it is indeed oppressive and offensive.

The fact that these professors found her complaint believable — that a document which guarantees and protects individual freedom could “trigger” someone — is telling. To them, it’s reasonable to resent the ideological tradition of the Constitution because natural law, Christianity, and the Enlightenment are awful.

How We Will Win

Indeed, ISIS’ allure to westerners has emerged during a crisis about our own beliefs. We’re embarrassed by our position of influence, history, and even our culture. Who would want to be a part of a group of self-conscious namby-pambies when you could join a group that unabashedly proclaims what it believes and inflicts terror to prove it?

We are becoming a bunch of spineless morons clinging to a dwindling pool of agreed-upon values while ISIS remains a set of tough guys willing to blow themselves up for a larger cause.

Countless westerners, even Americans, have fled our lukewarm, noncommittal, environment to one that upholds firm and clear-cut beliefs. We are becoming a bunch of spineless morons clinging to a dwindling pool of agreed-upon values while ISIS remains a set of rough and tough bad guys willing to blow themselves up for a larger cause.

Again, this conflict isn’t about geography, it’s about ideology, and that is why we won’t win by containing ISIS with air strikes and drone attacks. We will win by pushing back against radicalized Islamic beliefs with firm beliefs of our own. We must embrace and revitalize our history and the legacy of our Founding Fathers and push back with thousands of years of Western thought and tradition that have coalesced into our political system and culture.

We can defeat ISIS. After all, they’re fighting to kill everyone who doesn’t agree with them in order to usher in the apocalypse. In our fight against them — for freedom and peace — we can certainly make our Christian heritage and values more appealing than radical Islam. And we will win by doing just that.

Barack Obama: Worst. President. Ever.,"I still remember a lot of people telling me in 2006 that George W. Bush was the “worst president ever.”

They had no idea what they were talking about. This is what the “worst president ever” looks like. In his response to the attacks in Paris, Barack Obama has shown us a leader who is not just inadequate to his core responsibilities, but contemptuous of them.

It started Friday night with his first statement about the attacks. He was perfunctory, devoid of content, and utterly listless. His delivery was flat and without affect — expressing neither outrage nor sorrow — giving the impression that he had no desire to be in front of the cameras or to make any comment at all.

I don’t demand much out of an early press conference like this. The president still knows too few facts about the case and has not had time to formulate a detailed response. But he should at least look as if he cares. If France is “our oldest ally” and “represents the timeless values of human progress,” shouldn’t Obama be very engaged with what happens there?

By contrast, here was his same-day reaction to a mass shooting in Oregon six weeks earlier.

See especially the part about four minutes in. It’s clear that the prospect of imposing gun control domestically gets Obama riled up. Fighting the enemies of America overseas does not. But the first of these goals is actually prohibited to him by the Constitution — while the second is mandated for him. I don’t know if we’ve ever seen a president whose personal priorities are so out of sync with the actual demands of his office.

The administration’s reaction has only gotten worse as it has had more days to respond. On Tuesday, Secretary of State John Kerry let out the howler that the terrorist attack in France earlier this year — wiping out the headquarters of a satirical magazine that had offended radical Muslims — was kind of understandable.

There’s something different about what happened from Charlie Hebdo, and I think everybody would feel that. There was a sort of particularized focus and perhaps even a legitimacy in terms of—not a legitimacy, but a rationale that you could attach yourself to somehow and say, okay, they’re really angry because of this and that. This Friday was absolutely indiscriminate. It wasn’t to aggrieve one particular sense of wrong. It was to terrorize people.

To be sure, this sentiment didn’t come from Obama himself. But he hired Kerry, who has a record of making horribly insensitive statements. He is the same guy who thought a James Taylor song was an appropriate response to the Charlie Hebdo massacre — and Obama apparently agreed that this would make up for skipping out on an international unity rally in support of France. So maybe we know now why the administration couldn’t really get mobilized to show support for Charlie Hebdo: deep down, they thought the magazine had it coming.

Obama’s administration can’t even get the easy, symbolic stuff right. But the real problem is the substance of his response.

Obama can’t even get the easy, symbolic stuff right.

That brings us to Obama’s petty, peevish press conference on Monday. This is the president who infamously dismissed the Islamic State as the junior varsity squad and described it as “contained” just hours before the attacks in Paris. So naturally, he faced a flurry of questions challenging him on that. At which point, as Politico put it, “he appeared to lose patience with repeated questions about whether he underestimated the threat of the terror network.”

Even Democrats are concerned that “at times he was patronizing, at other times he seemed annoyed and almost dismissive.” Nothing was more dismissive than this comment:

If folks want to pop off and have opinions about what they think they would do, present a specific plan. If they think that somehow their advisors are better than the Chairman of my Joint Chiefs of Staff and the folks who are actually on the ground, I want to meet them. And we can have that debate. But what I’m not interested in doing is posing or pursuing some notion of American leadership or America winning, or whatever other slogans they come up with that has no relationship to what is actually going to work to protect the American people, and to protect people in the region who are getting killed, and to protect our allies and people like France. I’m too busy for that.

This was supposed to show that he doesn’t give a damn what his critics think, but it just shows that he doesn’t give a damn. This is the point inadvertently made by a blogger who praised him and put the issue in no uncertain terms, though I have bowdlerized it a bit to make it publishable on a family website.

We’ve kinda suspected it before, but President Obama genuinely gives no [damns] at this point. He is [damn] devoid. [Damn] deficient. [Damn] deprived. [Damn] destitute. His cupboard of [damns] is barren; his tank of [damns] has been depleted. You know how, on cloudy nights, you might look up into the vast and endless sky and not find any stars? The same thing would happen if you looked at Obama and searched for [damns]. And this, this total absence of [damns], is where pop off came from.”

This is supposed to make Obama “cool,” I guess, because it shows that he is defying the “haters” — those “haters” being his critics back home, not the guys shooting people on the streets of Paris. But it actually shows contempt for pretty much everybody. It’s contemptuous of some of his political allies, like Dianne Feinstein, who are concerned that the Islamic State is “not contained.” It’s contemptuous of the reporters who are asking him good, tough questions. And it’s contemptuous of the American people, who are suddenly concerned that attacks like the one in Paris are going to start happening in our own cities and who want some kind of reassurance that the president of the United States is on the job. They don’t want to be told that they are just “popping off,” or that the president isn’t taking their concerns seriously.

When Obama thinks of empty slogans, he thinks of ‘America winning.’

What they really want to hear is that America is leading and America is going to win. And Obama told us that he is above such petty concerns. Sure, he phrases it as opposition to empty sloganeering, but it’s revealing that when he thinks of empty slogans, he thinks of “America winning.”

So was this also empty sloganeering?

You ask, what is our policy? I can say: It is to wage war, by sea, land and air, with all our might and with all the strength that God can give us; to wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark, lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy. You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word: It is victory, victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be; for without victory, there is no survival.

Because that’s the sort of thing we need our president to say — and not just to say it, but to mean it.

We’ve had presidents before who made big mistakes. I remember George W. Bush, who messed up the occupation of Iraq (but fought like hell to recover). We’ve had presidents who were incompetent and inadequate. I remember Jimmy Carter and Desert One, his bungled response to the Iran hostage crisis. But I don’t know that we’ve ever had a president who didn’t really care about America winning — and who announced it to the public.

To realize how seriously he takes this, consider the detail with which he describes his basic discomfort with the core responsibility of the commander-in-chief. In response to suggestions (which, in his typical style, he exaggerated) to increase our efforts against the Islamic State, he responded:

Let’s assume that we were to send 50,000 troops into Syria. What happens when there’s a terrorist attack generated from Yemen? Do we then send more troops into there? Or Libya, perhaps? Or if there’s a terrorist network that’s operating anywhere else—in North Africa, or in Southeast Asia?

If I were Obama, by the way, I wouldn’t mention the idea of not sending troops to respond to a terrorist attack in Libya. Because he already did that, in Benghazi, and our ambassador and three other Americans died.

But the general point is a fair one. We can’t send troops everywhere. Does that mean we send them nowhere? Isn’t it his job to make those strategic allocations, to decide which threats are the most serious and require the most resources? And shouldn’t he consider that the threat from the Islamic State is getting a lot more serious? But he sees only the costs of action, not the costs of inaction, and he is paralyzed by it.

[E]very few months I go to Walter Reed, and I see a 25-year-old kid who’s paralyzed or has lost his limbs, and some of those are people I’ve ordered into battle. And so I can’t afford to play some of the political games that others may.

This is patronizing to our service members, who signed up for the job of killing terrorists, not just to sit around on base. But in case we didn’t get the point, he added:

[T]here are costs to the other side. I just want to remind people, this is not an abstraction. When we send troops in, those troops get injured, they get killed; they’re away from their families; our country spends hundreds of billions of dollars.

Obama’s outlook on national security is profoundly defeatist. He sees only the costs of action and regards victory as an illusion. Vox’s Matt Yglesias offers an essential explanation, from a sympathetic source, of how things look to Obama administration insiders.

Many senior administration officials at this point are part of the permanent national security apparatus, but the core group of real ‘Obama people’ has a surprisingly dovish self-conception, where they see themselves operating in a world in which demands for military intervention are constant and endless—from the media, from congressional Republicans, from foreign governments and their allies in Washington, and from the permanent security bureaucracy itself—but America’s actual ability to engage in non-counterproductive interventions is quite limited.

Thus, Yglesias concludes, “the hardest problem in US counterterrorism policy is in some ways as much a speechwriting challenge as anything else. The next time something goes wrong and an attack hits the United States, how do you sell the American people on the idea of not really doing anything about it?”

So the hardest problem in counter-terrorism is how to write speeches, or better yet, how to write speeches about doing nothing?

So the hardest problem in counter-terrorism is how to write speeches?

Well, I supposed that’s what we should expect from a president who got elected for his speeches and not for doing anything. And this, I suspect, is how he is going to end up being remembered as commander-in-chief: as the guy who, in a crisis, gave us petulant speeches about why he was doing nothing.

This is one of those moments when you almost appreciate the parliamentary system, which can hold a vote of no confidence in the chief executive. You want to talk about popping off? If Obama is traumatized and overwhelmed by the job of being commander-in-chief, he can pop off to the golf course and clear the way for someone else to do it.

Why ISIS Is Targeting France,"On Wednesday morning, Paris police raided a building in a neighborhood on the outskirts of the city notorious for its high crime, poverty, and North African population. During this raid, a woman detonated a bomb vest, taking her own life. This seems to indicate there was indeed another attack planned for Paris.

While ISIS is targeting Western countries in general, they are particularly focused on France. In view of ISIS’s recent success in executing a massive Mumbai-style terrorist attack in the City of Lights, it is worth examining why.

There are some obvious reasons: France is the number one global tourist destination and is known around the world. It holds a romantic place in the minds of many in the West in particular. It is the city of love, romance, elegance, and beauty. Everyone dreams of Paris. Attacking it hits a particular nerve because it feels like an attack on part of our mythology. The attack can also be seen as retribution for France’s air strikes in Syria.

But these motivations for the attacks are fairly surface-level. There are plenty of popular Western tourist destinations. And warnings of ISIS’s plan to attack France preceded French involvement in the airstrikes. There is a much deeper reason, one that is rooted in the very concept of the French state, which is the opposite of what ISIS stands for. France is set apart because of its unique political theory of the state and citizen.

The Right to Freedom From Religion

The French have long held to the ideals of universalism and laïcité (or strict secularism). This dates back to the French Revolution, when revolutionaries were seeking a way to give all people equal access to the state in order to avoid favoritism. They felt that to avoid unfair treatment or discrimination all citizens needed to be seen as absolutely equal. Acknowledging differences between them would be discriminatory.

By leaving religious preferences out, there would be no room for religious persecution or preferential treatment.

This particularly targeted the Catholic Church and its abuses of power, which is why secularism was seen as so vital. By leaving religious preferences out, there would be no room for religious persecution or preferential treatment.

Of course, it wasn’t as selfless or benevolent as all that. This new philosophy of universalism was also a way to secure allegiance to the newly born French Republic. Absolute equality required that no other entity should come between a person and the government, including not just religion but also regional loyalties. It was a defense against communautarisme (communitarianism, as opposed to republicanism). Attaining equality was, therefore, a pathway for state solidification.

Although laïcité was originally conceived to create absolute equality, it is now woven into the fabric of what it means to be French. Although once a very religious country, in 2009, only 4.5 percent of the population reported going to Mass regularly (mostly from the older generation). Because of this, there is little pushback from French people of European decent against secularism. It is one of the defining principles of the country, and it leaves little room for people who practice religion outwardly.

While the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen did guarantee freedom of religion, it did this by enforcing official secularism. Whereas in the United States we give people the right to express their religion openly, France gives people the right to be free from expressions of religion.

But ISIS Wants A Religious State

This political philosophy has had obvious repercussions for the minority Muslim population, the most obvious and inflammatory being the ongoing headscarf debate that has raged since the 1980s. Because the government runs French schools, they are conceived of as a place where citizens present themselves before the state. Therefore they are a place in which religion cannot play a role. Wearing religious symbols is viewed as inappropriate in this space, first, because it promotes the idea that everyone is not equal and the same, and second, because it indicates allegiances that come before loyalty to the state.

All this makes France an ideal example of what radical Islam finds so appalling about the West.

A law was finally passed in 2004 that banned people from wearing “conspicuous” religious signs such as large crosses, yarmulkes, or headscarves. Although the headscarf was being banned in the name of laïcité, many saw this as specifically targeting Muslims because of widespread negative attitudes toward this section of the population. This ongoing controversy has only fueled the chasm between France and its Muslim citizens.

All this makes France an ideal example of what radical Islam finds so appalling about the West. Islam has its own legal code by which to adjudicate daily life, Sharia, which implies an utter lack of separation between religion and the state, or public and private life. Some forms of Islam, like Salafism, also teach that the laws of Sharia should be executed under a Muslim state, the caliphate. What must a group like ISIS, that interprets Sharia strictly and imposes it in its self-proclaimed caliphate, think about a country like France, which fundamentally opposes the expression of religion in official public life?

France is the very antithesis of the Islamist project. Although there are many reasons why ISIS is targeting them, to understand it fully, we have to understand what ISIS believes, and why laïcité is so repugnant to its followers.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/11/19/why-isis-is-targeting-france/,2015-11-19
Why Women And Child Refugees Are A Threat,"In response to legislators and GOP candidates calling for Barack Obama to halt his Syrian refugee program, the president is accusing them of being scared of women and children. But in light of the evolution of terror in the Middle East, why are we stopping at identifying only men as potential terrorists?

Let’s begin with some numbers. According to the United Nations’ Refugee Agency, the majority of Syrian refugees are made up of men and women between ages 18 and 59: 22.1 percent men (49.7 percent for all age groups) and 23.7 percent women (50.3 percent for all age groups). An overwhelming number of those (98 percent) are Muslim.

It’s true (at least according to these stats) that many of the refugees are women and children, but this doesn’t mean they’re necessarily friendly. To make that assumption is to ignore the fact that jihadists use women and children in terrorist operations.

We only have to look to an attack as recent as Paris to see that this is true. When police raided a suburban Paris apartment where they believed the mastermind of the attacks was holed up and planning another attack, they found a woman, who blew herself up with an explosive vest. How many other women are playing either a support or active role in terrorism plots across the West? The use of women is becoming increasingly common as radical Islamists seek to breach areas on high alert for military-aged men.

Female Suicide Bombers Aren’t Freak Occurrences

Since the 1980s, women have accounted for nearly a quarter of attacks in several countries, including Iraq, Egypt, and Israel. Some research indicates that since 2002 women have carried out 50 percent of suicide attacks in Sri Lanka, Turkey, and Chechnya.

The new mantra is ‘even women must fight.’

According to an article in the Los Angeles Times that calls these attackers “Terror’s ‘invisible women,’” “a younger generation of female jihadists has come to believe that acts of violence can be just as liberating politically and spiritually for women as for men. A religious woman can deflect her parents’ or husband’s objections by invoking the name of religion, which trumps all. The new mantra is ‘even women must fight.’”

The Center for American Progress is critical of America’s ability to deal with radicalization, saying there’s a gaping hole in U.S. counterterrorism strategy: “the fact that terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda and the Taliban continue to exploit uniquely female motivations as a tool to recruit female suicide bombers to attack U.S. soldiers and international aid workers.”

Female Suicide Bombers Are More Lethal

The number of female suicide terrorists is on the rise, and it’s becoming “increasingly important to acknowledge and address this threat to American lives and interests.” Not only are female terrorists growing in number, they’re extremely successful bombers.

Mia Bloom from the International Center for the Study of Terrorism attributes their success to several factors, most notably the fact that many people still do not expect women to be involved in violence. The common social assumption that women are inherently weaker, gentler, and more peaceful than men discounts their ability to engage in such lethal activity. That assumption allows female suicide terrorists to be overlooked by and escape through security inspections in many conflict zones, despite recent attempts to correct this security lapse.

Attacks by women are more lethal, too. They’re able to more easily reach high-profile targets and carry out more assassinations because of the lack of security focus. For example, “Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s 1991 assassination by a Tamil Tiger female suicide bomber, who was close enough to touch his feet when the bomb went off, shows how much closer women can get to their targets in many scenarios.”

These unique capabilities are probably why women are responsible for 65 percent of all assassinations among groups that use female suicide terrorists, even though they only make up 15 percent of total suicide bombers in these same groups, according to Lindsey O’Rourke.

American Progress rightly says that “Women’s success in suicide attacks highlights just how little this national security threat is being addressed” and “if we want to actually protect our country, we can’t simply forget about half of the world’s population.”

Following the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January of this year, The New York Times reported that intelligence agencies have failed to appreciate the role women play in terror. While much will be made in the coming months of France’s intelligence failures, the West’s dismissal of female terrorists should come under the highest scrutiny.

Take the role of women in the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS or ISIL. While the group oppresses many women, many also flock to its ranks. Roughly 10 percent of its Western recruits are female, often lured by their peers through social media and instant messaging. The percentage is much higher in France: An estimated 63 of the 350 French nationals believed to be with the group are women, or just under 20 percent.

The media and policy makers “are playing catch-up when it comes to understanding the full extent of women’s roles in jihadist groups.”

A large part of the problem is the tendency to fixate on terrorist violence against women, whether it be Boko Haram’s mass kidnapping of schoolgirls in Nigeria or the Islamic State’s sexual violence, slavery, kidnappings and forced marriage. We prefer to see terror through the lens of gender, positing radical Muslim men against women, with the West as their only defender….



Terrorists are strategic about using women, in increasingly chilling ways. To fight them, we have to move past simplistic assumptions about gender and terror and get serious about helping women and girls who are on this deadly path, as well as their would-be victims.

Children Become Suicide Bombers, Too

While The New York Times calls for us to get more serious about female terrorists, those on the Right who are worried about terrorists posing as refugees are accused of being cold-hearted toward women and children.

In Nigeria, four women blew themselves up and a ten-year-old girl with an explosive belt was taken into police custody.

Yet think about the children: there have been reports of children being used as suicide bombers for years. In Nigeria, four women blew themselves up and a ten-year-old girl with an explosive belt was taken into police custody. CBS News has reported that “It is difficult to know how many children have been trained in Iraq and Syria, but there have been reports the number in recent months is in the hundreds.”

It’s a tactic the Taliban and other terrorist networks have perfected, recruiting children to kill as they yell, “Allahu Akbar.” PBS has reported as recently as this week that children and teens are being trained as ISIS suicide bombers. “It’s also a record of one particularly disturbing way the group is trying to expand its influence: training children and teenagers to become the next generation of jihadis,” PBS writes.

The children who are being trained are sometimes as young as five years old. This ISIS video is a disturbing picture of what we’re facing on the terrorist front. It shows lines of young children participating in drills and chanting verses from the Quran.

U.S. Government Exists to Protect U.S. Citizens

Given these facts, how can our president continue to allow Syrian refugees into our country, even if they’re mostly women and children (and that is up for debate)? Remember the Boston Marathon bombers? They were refugees too, fleeing the Chechen conflict. They were “vetted” and, just like those who knew the terrorists in France, friends and associates said they never suspected these refugees were radical Islamists.

When Obama mocks those who want to protect our citizens from the bloody hell those innocent people suffered in France, he needs to be reminded of the true face of our enemy. It’s not just a man’s face. It’s a woman’s face. It’s a child’s face. This isn’t xenophobic or uncharitable. It’s reality.

The job of the federal government is not to play Mother Teresa to the world. Its primary job is to protect Americans from harm. If President Obama is not willing to step up and do that job—even when it means denying women and children access to our homeland—then he needs to step aside.

Hillary Clinton's Denialism Sets Off Trump's Rhetoric On Islam,"The media are continuing their codependent obsession with Donald Trump by focusing, in this week’s edition of media-fueled Trumpmania, on comments he made regarding Muslims. You can look anywhere for evidence of this, but the first five Google hits for Donald Trump + Muslims are a good indication:

And on and on and on it goes. I get it. Trump is good for traffic. It’s fun to write outraged pieces about him! The media seem to have no limit for their love of covering everything he says. I was trying to find out what exactly, he’d said that had the media in such a tizzy and landed on an article headlined “The 7 Most Ridiculous Things Donald Trump Has Said In The Last 2 Weeks.” It was published in 2011. So forgive me if I opt out of this round of groupthink outrage on The Donald.

Or rather, while what Trump says (now, in 2011, in 1984, I could go on) is in fact, “ridiculous,” what other things are politicians saying that are also ridiculous?

Check out what Hillary Clinton said last week about the role Islam plays in global terrorism.

Let’s be clear, though. Islam is not our adversary. Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.

Part of this is fine rhetoric for a politician. And obviously the majority of Muslims, particularly American Muslims, are peaceful and tolerant. But to say that Muslims have “nothing whatsoever” to do with terrorism is simply not true. The world may wish it were so, but it’s not. It’s as clownish and cartoonish and demonstrably false as anything Trump has said in the last week.

To say that Muslims have ‘nothing whatsoever’ to do with terrorism is simply not true.

Clinton’s statement is extreme rhetoric that has no place in adult conversations in the aftermath of 9/11, which claimed the lives of 2,997. Or the attacks on U.S. embassies and consulates in Beirut, Karachi, Nairobi, Tanzania, Kenya, Sarajevo, Jeddah, Benghazi, Herat, and Erbil. Or the Moscow theater hostage situation, which killed more than 100 and injured more than 700. Or the nine synchronized bomb blasts in Jaipur that killed 80. Or the Ahmedabad bombings a year later that took the lives of 56 and injured 200. Followed two months later by the Delhi bombings that took another few dozen. Or the Islamabad Marriot hotel bombing that killed two U.S. servicemen and 52 others. The Qahtaniya bombings of the Yazidi that killed nearly 800 and wounded 1,600. The 2008 attacks on Christians in Mosul that killed more than 40. The siege of Mumbai, killing 166. The Little Rock recruitment office shooting. Fort Hood. The 2009 Marriott and Ritz-Carlton bombing in Indonesia. The Nag Hamadi massacre of Coptic Christians. The Moscow Metro bombings that killed 40. The London Underground bombings that killed 53 and injured 700. The Madrid train bombings that killed 191 people and wounded 1,800. The Mumbai train bombings that killed 209 injured more than 700. The Beslan school hostage crisis, where some 385 people — including 186 children — were killed. The murder of Theo Van Gogh. The 2005 Delhi bombings. The Amman bombings that killed more than 60 and injured 115. The Westgate shopping mall attack where 67 were killed and 175 wounded. ISIS’ beheadings of Americans, of Christians, of other enemies of the state. Paris.

Each of these attacks — and countless others — were done in the name of Islam. And while it might comfort us to issue platitudes about Islam being peaceful and having “nothing to do” with these attacks, such statements are unbecoming of serious politicians.

Anyone with a brain wave and a pulse knows that Islam and Islamist terrorism have a relationship.

Anyone with a brain wave and a pulse knows that Islam and Islamist terrorism have a relationship. What’s more, refusal to acknowledge that Islam contains within it groups of people dedicated to such carnage actually does more damage to peaceful Muslims than otherwise. Would you rather have those people who are cognizant of world events understand that there is a stream of thought within Islam that lends itself to such violence or to believe that all Muslims are so inclined? Because in a world with the reality of Islamist terrorism, that’s the option its prominent deniers are giving people.

Cathy Young made this point when she noted a Daily Beast article about some group of college students saying that remembering 9/11 was offensive to Muslims, “Are you saying that all Muslims are terrorists?” she asked.

Seriously. Check out this ad that was put out by Democrats this past week. It’s mindboggling.

First off, if you told me that this was a Republican ad, I would have believed you. It was produced in a country where fully two-thirds of respondents to a recent poll used the term “radical Islam” to describe the enemy. You will of course note that there is not a drop of conflict between GOP politicians talking about Islamist terrorism or the other problems of radical Islam and George W. Bush’s statements about not being at war with Islam. That’s because both of these statements are true. Islamist terrorism is a problem, and the U.S. is not at war with Islam. It’s Democrats who come off bigoted in this ad by their implicit argument that all Muslims are indistinguishable from one other, no matter their particular political or religious views.

‘Strange New Respect’ For George W. Bush

In the hours after Islamist terrorists carried out their attacks on American soil in 2001, President George W. Bush and his advisors agreed on a strategy for talking about the role Islam. It was difficult because the attacks were perpetrated by Muslim terrorists who based their violence in their understanding of their religion. So the Bush administration was trying to manage what they worried could be a touchy situation both domestically and globally. They wanted to make sure that American Muslims weren’t subject to retaliatory violence. And they wanted to make sure that global Muslims didn’t feel the need to pick a side against the U.S. in the coming days.

So on September 17, 2001, President Bush visited the Islamic Center of Washington, D.C., and said, “The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam. That’s not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace. These terrorists don’t represent peace. They represent evil and war.”

This was a political statement, as were other similar statements. Bush was no more qualified to opine on Islamic theology than the vast majority of politicians and talking heads who have done so in the years since. What’s more, it was an emergency political statement, a measure taken to address immediate problems.

‘Strange new respect’ is the term for how the media do everything they can to demonize and tear down whichever Republican is in power or in the news.

It’s been hilarious to watch the media and other progressives pull out the “strange new respect” routine for Bush’s political positioning of Islam. “Strange new respect” is the term for how the media do everything they can to demonize and tear down whichever Republican is in power or in the news. Then, a decade later, they pretend that the Republican they loathed was in fact totally reasonable all along in order to demonize and tear down whichever Republican is in power or in the news.

Many reporters are probably too young to remember, but the media treatment of Bush was so bad by 2004 that non-unhinged observers referred to it as Bush Derangement Syndrome. If there was one Republican I was sure wouldn’t get the “strange new respect” treatment — much less so quickly — it was George W. Bush. In any case, he’s getting it now.

“Islam means peace,” we’re told, but it actually means submission. Not to make a qualitative judgment, but if it did mean peace, it would have never left the Arabian Peninsula, but it did and almost immediately. The battle of Yarmuk, one of the most significant battles in human history, took place in 636, just four years after Muhammad died. In Syria, as it happens. A small band of Muslim soldiers overtook the mighty Byzantines in just six days, ending Byzantine rule there. Military historians say what was needed to defeat the Muslim invaders was a quick deployment of forces. That didn’t happen, so the Muslim army worked quickly to overpower a much larger opponent. It was one of the battles Osama bin Laden mentioned in his inspirational statements about how to overtake Westerners.

Here’s a quick and dirty animated map showing the expansion of Islam via conquest:

According to historian Will Durant:

The Islamic conquest of India is probably the bloodiest story in history. It is a discouraging tale, for its evident moral is that civilization is a precious good, whose delicate complex of order and freedom, culture and peace, can at any moment be overthrown by barbarians invading from without or multiplying within.

The Cost Of Denialism

Politico published a piece this week headlined, “Molenbeek broke my heart: A former resident reflects on his struggles with Brussels’ most notorious neighborhood.” How did Molenbeek become Europe’s jihadi base? Teun Voeten says:

But the most important factor is Belgium’s culture of denial. The country’s political debate has been dominated by a complacent progressive elite who firmly believes society can be designed and planned. Observers who point to unpleasant truths such as the high incidence of crime among Moroccan youth and violent tendencies in radical Islam are accused of being propagandists of the extreme-right, and are subsequently ignored and ostracized.



The debate is paralyzed by a paternalistic discourse in which radical Muslim youths are seen, above all, as victims of social and economic exclusion. They in turn internalize this frame of reference, of course, because it arouses sympathy and frees them from taking responsibility for their actions. The former Socialist mayor Philippe Moureax, who governed Molenbeek from 1992 to 2012 as his private fiefdom, perfected this culture of denial and is to a large extent responsible for the current state of affairs in the neighborhood.



Two journalists had already reported on the presence of radical Islamists in Molenbeek and the danger they posed — and both became victims of character assassination. In 2006, Hind Fraihi, a young Flemish woman of Morrocan descent published “Undercover in Little Morocco: Behind the Closed Doors of Radical Islam.” Her community called her a traitor; progressive media called her a “spy” and a “girl with personal problems.”

No, Islam isn’t synonymous with peace, and Bush was just doing politics when he claimed otherwise in the stressful aftermath of 9/11. But as much as his apologetics were amateur, they were significantly more excusable than pushing out the same false rhetoric now.

We are not children. We have read the news in the last 14 years. The attack on the Radisson hotel in Mali is simply the latest bloody demonstration that Islamist terrorism is real. We know that the terrorists are truly and genuinely motivated by their religious beliefs, however much the professors writing op-eds assert they are not. And while there may be an earnest debate about what can and should be done to deal with Islamist terrorism, no serious person can deny its existence.

So yes, Trump’s rhetoric is extreme. (Can you believe it? Donald Trump! The man known for his probity and reasonableness.) But the other extreme is also dangerous. That’s the extreme that denies the reality of Islamist terrorism, the threat it poses in Paris, London, New York, Mumbai, Madrid, Karachi, Delhi, Cairo, Jerusalem, Khobar, Washington, D.C., Moscow, Nairobi, Benghazi, and throughout the world.

It’s telling that much of the media find only one of the views extreme.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/11/24/hillary-clintons-denialism-is-the-other-extreme-of-trumps-rhetoric-on-islam/,2015-11-24
Carly Fiorina Shows How To Respond To Planned Parenthood Shooting,"We don’t yet know much about Friday’s shooting at a Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Robert Lewis Dear took the facility in a siege lasting five hours, killed three people and injured nine more.

As information trickles out, it seems increasingly likely that Dear was mentally unstable. His ex-wife said he looked much more unkempt on television than she knew him to be and “Something must have happened to him when he moved away, that’s all I know.” His record isn’t spotless, with arrests for animal cruelty and voyeurism. There are reports he was prone to hiding food in the woods and fond of skinny dipping.

For the Left, however, this isn’t about the scant facts we can state with certainty or even the possibility that we’re dealing with an incoherent or evil individual. No, the response from the Left is something else altogether, something best described as “furthering the narrative.”

See, while a source did tell media outlets Dear muttered something about “baby parts,” that doesn’t exactly support the assertion of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains President Vicki Cowart that “We’ve seen an alarming increase in hateful rhetoric and smear campaigns against abortion providers and patients over the last few months That environment breeds acts of violence.”

Executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America Dawn Leguens echoed this statement, using strikingly similar language (I’m sure they didn’t talk to one another before releasing their statements. They’d never collaborate on the narrative.): “One of the lessons of this awful tragedy is that words matter, and hateful rhetoric fuels violence. It’s not enough to denounce the tragedy without also denouncing the poisonous rhetoric that fueled it.”

Carly Fiorina Gives Us Some Perspective

Dear’s response to pro-life sentiments was decidedly anti-life. He may well turn out to have believed he was receiving orders from the little people in the television or the dogs in his neighborhood he so loathed, but at this juncture virtually everything is inference and assumption. To flatly assert motive, especially so nebulous a motive as “rhetoric,” is irresponsible.

To flatly assert motive, especially so nebulous a motive as ‘rhetoric,’ is irresponsible.

Of course, the narrative isn’t about staid truth, but emotion. Wait, narrative? There’s no narrative, just objective truths pushing against right-wing lies. In other words, we knew the spin would happen.

Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina knew it. In an interview with Fox News’ Chris Wallace, Fiorina said attempts to attribute this attack to pro-lifers at large were an example of “typical left-wing tactics.”

Contrary to Cowart and Leguens, Fiorina also offered the best response to the tragedy, avoiding inference and assumption: “This is a tragedy. It’s obviously a tragedy—Nothing justifies this, and presumably this man who appears deranged, if nothing else, will be tried for murder as he should be, but it’s a tragedy especially on a holiday weekend.”

Fiery Rhetoric Obviously Causes Shooting Sprees

Now why would Fiorina denounce such strategies as typical left-wing tactics? Jose DelReal, a writer at the Washington Post and male model, offers an indirect clue in the opening paragraph to his article on how various GOP presidential candidates responded to the attack: “Several Republican presidential candidates on Sunday condemned the attack on a Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado Springs but stopped short of agreeing with liberal critics who say that fiery antiabortion rhetoric contributed to the shooting.”

The ethics of collecting fetal tissue? A ‘grim light?’

That isn’t quite as bad as “When did you stop beating your wife?,” but it’s close. It’s especially close when you consider DelReal’s statement just a few paragraphs later: “Calls to defund Planned Parenthood through congressional action have escalated in recent months amid a protracted national debate about the ethics of collecting fetal tissue for research” and “That dialogue was cast in a grim light after reports that the suspected Colorado gunman is said to have used the phrase ‘no more baby parts’ while discussing his motives for the attack.”

The ethics of collecting fetal tissue? A “grim light?” DelReal obviously has no personal feelings on abortion access or Deal’s motivations. He obviously isn’t concerned with the narrative. I mean, there isn’t even a narrative. We never experience groupthink, especially groupthink pushed by those in positions of power. It never happens. Which brings us back to Carly.

Don’t Exploit Tragedies for Political Gain

If Dear is a pro-life nut, we have to acknowledge that. We have to own that he’ll be tied to us and explain why he isn’t one of us. We must defend our actual goals and explain that his actions are the opposite of what we seek. If he’s just a crazy person muttering about baby parts and chemtrails, then that doesn’t lessen the tragedy. As Fiorina said, “Any protesters should always be peaceful, whether it’s Black Lives Matter or pro-life protesters.”

A clear and honest discussion of a tragedy—particularly before the facts are known—isn’t likely to change the narrative.

Such language, such a clear and honest discussion of a tragedy—particularly before the facts are known—isn’t likely to change the narrative. There will still be those more invested in politics than in truth. But it does offer a stark contrast to the narrative, especially when people begin to sour on never letting a good tragedy go to waste.

At a vigil for the dead and wounded held at All Souls Unitarian Universalist Church in Colorado Springs, one member stood and left when the conversation shifted to reproductive rights and the need for stricter gun control. “I thought we were here to grieve and mourn and not make political statements,” she said.

“It’s important to remember the people who face harm’s way every day because of the obscene access we have to assault weapons in this community. If we do not recognize something must be done, then we have fallen short in honoring the lives of those who have been lost,” Nori Rost, All Saints’ senior minister, responded.

Yes, that’s it. Dear’s actions weren’t about him and what was going on in his head. They were about rhetoric and the problematic nature of the Bill of Rights. If we don’t recognize that, then we dishonor those who have died. It’s all so simple.

Ending Evil Means Ending Freedom

Except it’s not simple. Evil doesn’t make sense, and trying to find a reason for it is often futile. We should simply call it what it is—evil—and recognize that it is illogical and generally unstoppable. We should accept C.S. Lewis’ formulation: “God created things which had free will. That means creatures which can go wrong or right. Some people think they can imagine a creature which was free but had no possibility of going wrong, but I can’t. If a thing is free to be good it’s also free to be bad. And free will is what has made evil possible. Why, then, did God give them free will? Because free will, though it makes evil possible, is also the only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having.”

Evil doesn’t make sense, and trying to find a reason for it is often futile.

Alas, for those who seek political ends from all means—those who don’t really grasp love or goodness or joy or any other thing except power—this truth doesn’t offer them a chance to denounce their opponents nor reasons to increase the size and scope of government. It is too ethereal and not as malleable as they would like.

At the end of “Midnight of the Garden of Good and Evil,” Jim Williams, a southern art dealer of a different sort than Deal, was accused of murdering his lover in a fit of rage. He maintained it was an act of self-defense and was found not guilty in a jury trial. Journalist John Kelso, who covered the trial and became friends with Williams, asked after the verdict what really happened on that fateful night. Williams smiled slyly and told him, “Sport, truth, like art, is in the eye of the beholder. You believe what you choose and I’ll believe what I know.”

When it comes to tragedies like those in Colorado Springs, truth unfortunately is in the eye of the beholder. Even if Deal stops muttering, it will remain there. At the end of the day, we’ll be left with nothing to believe but what we can piece together from the event and his statements, while the Left will believe what it knows.

Given the Left knew what they believed even before the shooting, we all have to be a bunch of Fiorinas. We have to be calm and dedicated to the truth, be firm and respectful, and refuse to accede to the narrative. The alternative is to let evil determine the conversation and the state deprive us of anything worth having.

World Leaders Fiddle With Climate Change While Paris Burns,"This week, more than 150 world leaders are gathering in Paris to fight what they believe is today’s greatest global threat to peace and prosperity. They hold a common belief that this threat requires immediate and drastic action and that without a coordinated effort no real advances will be made against this enemy. The United Nations climate summit has just begun.

They are not meeting to discuss the radical Islamist terrorist organization ISIS, which has established a caliphate in the ashes of what was Syria and Iraq, and only two and a half weeks ago struck terror into the heart of Paris. No. At a time when France is still under a state of emergency from those attacks, the leaders of 150 countries are coming together to talk about climate change.

Regardless of your opinion on the dangers of a changing climate, what’s causing it, or what can be done about it, this UN summit hits a raw nerve given its proximity to the ISIS attacks in Paris that left 130 dead and over 400 wounded. The attention it’s getting implies a lack of interest in the very real global threat of Islamist terrorism today. It seems the world’s leaders would prefer to put their energy into a topic that garners broad support at home rather than tread into the murky waters of Islamic jihad (or, in Hilary Clinton’s anodyne phrasing, “radical jihadist ideology”).

Only a Weathervane Friend

President Obama is a fine example of this. He and his administration have refused to include any references to Muslims or Islamism when referring to ISIS attacks in Paris and elsewhere. Obama insists, as Clinton does, that it’s generic “extremism” we are fighting, not anything religious, cowing to pressure from American Muslim interest groups with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, like the Council for American-Islamic Relations and the Muslim Student Association.

The irony is thick on this one, with a mounting international feeling that if we don’t do something soon ISIS will become un-containable.

After the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January, the heads of state from multiple countries marched through the streets of Paris with French President François Hollande, joining in saying “Je suis Charlie.” But Obama didn’t have time for America’s oldest ally. Instead, he put John Kerry in charge of reaching out, and Kerry in turn sent James Taylor to sing, embarrassingly, “You’ve Got a Friend.” Such an empty gesture can’t conceal the United States’s lack of interest in coordinating against ISIS.

Yet when it comes to the global threat of climate change, Obama is front and center. In his speech in Paris on the opening day of the summit, he evoked Martin Luther King Jr. when he warned it is possible to be “too late” to prevent a crisis.

According to Obama, we are approaching that moment with climate change, and he is ready to act. The irony is thick on this one, with a mounting international feeling that if we don’t do something soon ISIS will become un-containable. Its roots will have spread so deep and far that it will become impossible to defend against it, much less dismantle it.

Ignore the Armed Men Behind the Curtain

Obama is more concerned with climate change because this was always going to be a part of his legacy. He’s had his eyes set on this from the beginning—just as he always planned to be the president who got us out of Iraq and shrunk our military presence internationally. Addressing climate change is part and parcel of his leftist agenda, and there’s no way he would let it be drowned out by some “jayvee team” from Iraq and Syria.

Obama doesn’t care about the fragmented and unstable Middle East we will leave future generations.

Although he made a nod toward the Paris attacks by visiting the Bataclan music hall and having a working dinner about ISIS with President Hollande on Monday night, his primary goal is leaving Paris with an actionable and enforceable climate change agreement. This is his top priority.

At the summit, Obama said that we must think about the long term, and put aside our immediate desires regarding industry and energy. Instead, we should think of the world we’ll be leaving our children. But this is exactly what he won’t do as he refuses to acknowledge the threat of violent Islamism.

He is shortsighted concerning ISIS because he only cares about the immediate political backlash at home if he puts more troops in Iraq so soon after ceremoniously—and prematurely—withdrawing them in 2011. He doesn’t care about the fragmented and unstable Middle East we will leave future generations, or the potential that instability could spark another regional or world war.

Money for Anything But Defense

We are not even sure we can affect and control climate change, yet our leaders are willing to commit to huge financial and economic alterations anyway. The United States is pledging to double its R&D budget for clean energy over the next five years. In the meantime, we won’t commit to fighting ISIS with any real conviction, even though we would have a major effect on its demise. And the defense budget continues to shrink.

Obama doesn’t apply the same logic to ISIS that he applies to climate change: if you break it, you buy it.

Obama also acknowledged our role in causing climate change and our particular responsibility to do something about it. How is it that he is not equally capable of acknowledging his own role in creating ISIS? He has no problem finding fault with America going into Iraq in the Bush era and blaming it for the rise of ISIS, but he refuses to admit the premature withdrawal of troops from Iraq that he ordered left the vacuum that allowed ISIS to flourish. He doesn’t apply the same logic to ISIS that he applies to climate change: if you break it, you buy it.

On Monday, Hollande equated the global climate-change threat with the threat of “extremism” (code for Islamist terrorism). Obama went so far as to say that the climate talks are a way to rebuke ISIS. Our president is living in a fantasy world if he thinks that ISIS will feel at all chastened by this summit. The one thing they might feel is relieved. The world doesn’t yet take them seriously enough to do much more than convene a summit on climate change in response to a major terrorist attack.

The world leaders flocking to Paris are worried about being on the “right side of history” on climate change. This is one of Obama’s favorite turns of phrase. But what about being on the right side of history when it concerns homegrown terrorist attacks by Islamist radicals? Or religious genocide in the Middle East? Surely the history books will have something to say about that.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/12/02/world-leaders-fiddle-with-climate-change-while-paris-burns/,2015-12-02
Bill Nye The Propaganda Guy,"You have no doubt come across the type of people who proclaim that they loooooove science. Why, they don’t just love science, they freaking love science. For the most part, they demonstrate this love not by actually making scientific discoveries or using science in their work, but by liking the right posts on Facebook.

At any rate, puffed up by their confidence in their love of science, they tend to think this makes them extra-super-qualified to talk about any and every subject. They propound with the extra authority of someone whose opinions must be based on facts and reality, because he freaking loves science.

One prominent example is Bill Nye the Science Guy. He must really love science, because it’s right there in his name! And so he came to propound upon the causes of terrorism, arguing that yes, the recent terror attacks in Paris could indeed be traced back to the nefarious effects of “climate change.”

Here is the argument, in all its blazing, thickheaded ignorance.

It’s very reasonable that the recent trouble in Paris is a result of climate change. There is a water shortage in Syria, this is fact-based. Small and medium farmers have abandoned their farms because there’s not enough water, not enough rainfall. And especially the young people who have not grown up there, have not had their whole lives invested in living off the land, the young people have gone to the big cities looking for work. There’s not enough work for everybody, so the disaffected youths, as we say, the young people who don’t believe in the system, believe the system’s failed, don’t believe in the economy are more easily engaged and more easily recruited by terrorist organizations, and then they end up part way around the world in Paris shooting people.

“This is fact-based,” he assures us.

Well. Where to start?

The uprising in Syria did not start among unemployed farm boys.

To begin with, the uprising in Syria did not start among unemployed farm boys in Damascus. It started in Daraa, a smaller city of about 100,000 people in southwest Syria. A group of teenagers were caught writing graffiti with slogans like, “The people want the fall of the regime,” and “It’s your turn, doctor,” a reference to Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, who used to be an ophthalmologist. The kids were imprisoned and tortured, and their angry parents responded by storming the local Baath Party headquarters and burning it down. This sparked a series of protests across Syria calling for human rights and political liberalization, all brutally suppressed.

A couple of questions for Mr. Nye: If your thuggish government were torturing your children, would you want to tear it down and destroy it? And would your answer depend on how hot and wet it is outside?

The kind of people who preen themselves on how much they love science also tend to preen themselves on how sensitive and compassionate they are when it comes to people living outside America, especially those outside Europe — you know, in the hot, dusty, poor countries. Yet somehow it doesn’t occur to them to pay attention to the facts about the origins of the Syrian uprising or to pay respect to the real suffering of victims of the Assad regime. No, they look at events elsewhere in the world and project onto them their own domestic political concerns.

Now let’s trace the cause of the Syrian rebellion a little farther. Why were these Syrian kids putting up anti-regime graffiti? Their slogans were clearly inspired by the Arab Spring that had recently erupted in Tunisia and Egypt. Did those countries have water shortages, too? Or is there perhaps some ideological cause — having to do with representative government and human rights — that might have a lot more to do with it?

Of course, the Syrian civil war has since become a playground for Islamists and jihadists, but where did they come from? The Islamic State was founded, not by unemployed farm boys, but by hardened fighters left over from the failed insurgency in Iraq. Seeing the chaos next door in Syria, they took advantage of it to establish a stronghold and revive their old insurgency across the border (with help from the dithering and incompetence of the Obama administration).

These insurgents, in turn, were originally inspired by al-Qaeda, a terrorist organization founded by Osama bin Laden, the scion of a fabulously wealthy Saudi family; and Ayman al-Zawahiri, an Egyptian physician. They claimed justification for terrorism in doctrines about holy war and the spread of religion by the sword that are extracted from the life and sayings of Mohammed.

I’m sure there was climate change in sixth century Arabia, because the climate is always changing.

I’m pretty sure there was climate change going on in sixth century Arabia, because the climate is always changing. I’m also certain that many people at the time of Mohammed were desperately poor, because most people have been desperately poor for most of human history. But I’m even more certain that our SUVs and carbon dioxide emissions had nothing to do with either.

The French Connection

What about the connection between Syria and Paris? On this issue, Mr. Nye clearly didn’t get the memo about the correct political line of the moment: that the Paris attacks had absolutely nothing to do with the inflow of Syrian refugees into Europe. On the other hand, it’s not totally clear yet whether any of the Paris attackers came from Syria, but it is clear that a lot of them were French citizens, who were born in the country. Europe’s problem is not disaffected Syrian youth leaving their desert farms to go to Paris. The problem is disaffected European youth traveling to Syria to join the jihad and then coming back, or those who don’t go to Syria but want to join the Islamist cause by fighting in Europe.

Take Hasna Aitboulahcen, killed in a firefight at the apartment of the Paris attacks’ ringleader. The daughter of Moroccan immigrants, she grew up in a French housing project, where she became known as a Western-style party girl. If her disaffection is a product of anything, it is a product of the European welfare state, not global warming.

This is spectular, willful ignorance dressed up as love for science.

All of these facts are readily available to anyone who follows the news.

And then there is the role in these attacks of a major world religion with about a billion followers that has been around for 1400 years — a primary cause that is a little hard to miss. Yet President Obama, Nye, and many other water-carriers for the Left offer us glib pronouncements about how this is all about water shortages in Syria. This is spectacular, willful ignorance dressed up as love for science.

I, too, am a great admirer of science. If I were an inarticulate boob, I might even say that “I freaking love science.” What I take from that is a desire to emulate the spirit and methods of science in all fields, such as an absolute respect for the facts and a rigorous investigation of underlying causes.

All of you “science guys” out there might want to try it some time.

"On ISIS, Barack Obama Is Baghdad Bob","“ISIS is contained” is the new “American tanks are not in Baghdad” of 2015.

In the throes of a tight re-election campaign in October of 2012, President Barack Obama declared that al Qaeda was “on the run.” In one sense, he was right: al Qaeda was running into the arms of ISIS, which was running wild in the Middle East. But his intended implication–that his policies had routed the terrorists, rendered them incapable of hurting Americans, and as a result made America safer from the threat of terrorist attack–was demonstrably false.

In an interview with ABC News the day before deadly terrorist attacks in Paris which killed 130 people and injured scores more, Obama famous declared that ISIS had been “contained” due to his administration’s policies.

On Wednesday, while the San Bernardino terrorists were still at large, Obama told CBS News in a taped interview that America was safe from the threat of ISIS attacks.

“The American people should feel confident that, you know, we are going to be able to defend ourselves and make sure that, you know, we have a good holiday and go about our lives,” Obama said.

As a result of Wednesday’s terrorist attack in San Bernardino, at least 14 people will most certainly not be going about their lives, nor will their families and friends be enjoying a “good holiday” this year. On Friday, just a day after Obama’s ISIS comments were aired, law enforcement officials disclosed that one of the San Bernardino terrorists had pledged allegiance to ISIS on her personal Facebook page.

In other words, the 44th American president is now our very own Baghdad Bob. He is a man clinging so desperately to his narrative–terrorists are on the run because I ended the war in Iraq and killed bin Laden–that no amount of facts or evidence could possibly convince him his narrative might be wrong, even as that narrative is unraveling in real-time before his very eyes:

In March of 2003, Saddam’s Minister of Information was everybody’s favorite inadvertent comedian. Sporting a kicky black beret and delightfully bombastic lexicon, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf appeared on TV daily to predict American failure and deny the Baghdad invasion–sometimes even as U.S. tanks appeared behind him. “He’s great,” President George W. Bush said of Sahaf, admitting that he occasionally interrupted meetings to watch Sahaf’s briefings. “Someone accused us of hiring him and putting him there. He was a classic.”



Sahaf became the subject of T-shirts, mugs, adoring websites, a pop song, and an action figure. Besides adding levity to news cycles otherwise filled with fuzzy green explosions, Sahaf represented everything that made Iraq’s invasion seem not quite like a real war. Wars are serious, and this guy was adorable. Even if you opposed the Iraq invasion, you had to admit it’s hard to respect a government whose official mouthpiece told a reporter, “Shock and awe? It seems that we are the awe on them. They are suffering from the shock and awe, okay?”

We all laughed at Baghdad Bob at the time, because what kind of delusional apparatchik would declare that there are no America tanks in Baghdad when American tanks can be seen in the background rolling through Baghdad? Baghdad Bob was funny, because Baghdad Bob was not in charge of protecting us. He was in charge of protecting Saddam Hussein.

But when your own president engages in the same absurd behavior–declaring that ISIS is contained while the group was planning a devastating attack in Paris that it would launch the very next day, or declaring that America is safe from the terrorist threat of ISIS while a terrorist who had pledged allegiance to ISIS was on the run from police after assisting in the execution of at least 14 completely innocent people at an office party in California–it’s not even remotely amusing. It’s terrifying.

And it’s not just Obama. This disease of delusion has spread to members of his cabinet as well.

U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced after the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino that her “greatest fear” was not future deadly terrorist attacks against innocent Americans. Instead, Lynch said her “greatest fear” was that there might be an anti-Muslim backlash as a result of the terrorist attacks. She then transitioned into a discussion about the need for America to accept more refugees from the Middle East, according to Politico, which covered her remarks at a Muslim Advocates dinner event on Thursday. She did not mention during her remarks that one of the San Bernardino terrorists was an immigrant with a Pakistani passport who had passed a Department of Homeland Security background check prior to being admitted into the U.S.

This is madness.

Barack Obama refused to admit that Americans are most certainly not safe from the threat of ISIS attack, even while ISIS apostles were murdering American citizens in California. The White House refuses to admit that ISIS, an acronym in which the very first letter stands for “Islamic,” is driven by a devotion to a radical interpretation of Islam that declares all infidels must be slaughtered by faithful Muslims in service of Allah. This is not foreign policy. It is a deadly form of political schizophrenia that has all but crippled the president’s ability to differentiate between reality and fantasy. “ISIS is not Islamic” and “Americans are nowhere near Baghdad” are two sides of the same delusional coin.

Our president has decided that his narrative is more important than our safety. That his legacy is more important than our security. Extreme Islamic terrorists are not “on the run.” ISIS is not “contained.” And America is not safe from the threat of future terrorist attacks from ISIS and its radical Islamic adherents.

That is the reality of 2015, whether Baghdad Barack wishes to acknowledge it or not.

San Bernardino Terrorists Followed ISIS Rules,"Federal investigators have declared the shooting death of 14 people in San Bernardino an “act of terrorism,” but they say there’s still no evidence that Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik were part of an ISIS network. However, guidelines the terrorist group posted for women who want to become jihadists show that while ISIS does give direct orders in some situations, ISIS sympathizers can act on their own in others. Either way, ISIS is the controlling entity.

According to ARA News, an independent Syrian press agency, ISIS released new rules for female jihadists last month. The guidelines were developed in response to an Arab woman who wasn’t part of a network but wanted to serve the mujahideen if war came to Saudi Arabia (where Malik was living before she married Farook and came to the United States).

ISIS responded to the “female sympathizer” by releasing a statement including basic guidelines for all jihadi women. This is from the ARA News report:

‘Women can make jihad to support the religion of God according to their capabilities, whether by nursing, sewing, or serving through cooking, washing and other things,’ the ISIS-linked Zura Foundation quoted the group’s statement as saying.



The group pointed out if a woman is raided in her house, she may defend herself with weapons, detonating her suicide belt if needed. ‘She has the right to bomb it without the permission of others (apparently from the group),’ the statement read.



‘She also can fight without the permission of others, in case she was under attack by infidels,’ said the group’s Foundation, adding: ‘Women are allowed to carry out martyrdom (suicidal) operations only if the Emir (ISIS leading member) orders it.’



‘Women may use a sniper rifle according to orders from the Emir,’ the group argued.

The statement added that women are also invited to military training only if they were dressed according to Sharia and separated from men.

How does this apply to the attack in San Bernardino? First, Malik pledged allegiance to ISIS on Facebook. Second, ISIS called the couple “lions” on social media just after the attack—“lions” is a designation usually reserved for militants affiliated with ISIS. Third, Reuters has reported that Saturday in an online radio broadcast, al-Bayan, ISIS called Malik and her husband “followers of the Islamic State.” Finally, the Daily Mail is reporting that she had links to Pakistan’s most notorious radical cleric and mosque.

ISIS called the couple ‘lions’ on social media just after the attack—’lions’ is a designation usually reserved for militants affiliated with ISIS.

Given these facts, it’s clear that the couple served the interests of the Islamic State, and according to the guidelines set down for jihadi women, Malik would not have needed direct orders to carry out an attack unless she planned to die in it.

There has been no indication from police reports that the couple had on suicide vests or that they were using “sniper rifles,” which would have required approval by a leading member of ISIS. However, if there is any proof that Malik knew she would die in that attack, if she used a sniper rifle, had on a suicide belt, or planned to wear one, she would have needed direct approval from an ISIS leader.

In its response on social media after the attacks, ISIS said, “Welcome to a new era” in terrorism. This is what that new era looks like. Followers of ISIS anywhere in the world have their directives. This is true for women and men. They don’t need to wait for specific commands, because they are of one mind.

These are not lone wolves acting on inspiration alone. They have orders already. They don’t even need to rely on ISIS to formulate a plan or find a target. That’s up to them. Whether it’s at an Army base or a Christmas party, they can attack the infidels anywhere, any time, and for any apparent “situational” reason. The goal is the same: Destroy the American way of life—all in allegiance to the Islamic State.

Not All Shooting Sprees Are Terrorism,"For a long time it seemed many liberals couldn’t utter the phrase “terrorism.” President Obama even dropped “terrorism” from the war on terror. In recent months and especially this past week, however, liberals have finally started to embrace talking about terrorism.

Unfortunately, many pundits and journalists have either been misapplying terrorism or intentionally misusing the charge for political purposes. The New York Daily News is a prime offender. On December 4, they published National Rifle Association (NRA) President Wayne LaPierre’s photo on their front page, alongside the photos of some of America’s most infamous mass shooters, calling all of them terrorists.

Smearing the NRA as terrorists is standard fare for New York’s daily bird cage-lining rag. On October 3, it published a column by its own Linda Stasi calling for the State Department to list the NRA as a terrorist organization.

It is just a bit more surprising and irresponsible that the Daily News printed LaPierre’s photo just five days after publishing Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains President Vicki Cowart’s comments that she thought “hateful language [and] hateful speech” contributed to the shooting at Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs.

Television anchors asked Republican politicians if they would modify their language. But no Republican lawmaker has called the Planned Parenthood head a terrorist, nor have they called Planned Parenthood their “enemy” with the righteous fury Hillary Clinton and other Democrats hurled at the NRA at their debate. Hillary even compared opponents of abortion to terrorists and the NRA to “the Iranians or the communists.”

Murder Isn’t Terrorism

Labeling democratic activism as terrorism is the kind of thing authoritarian governments do to silence their critics. Beyond the irresponsible, illiberal, and hypocritical smear against a non-violent activist, the Daily News cover is wrong for misapplying the terrorist label to two psychopathic thugs who are not terrorists—the Sandy Hook shooter and the Aurora shooter.

Labeling democratic activism as terrorism is the kind of thing authoritarian governments do to silence their critics.

To make this distinction is not to excuse or show sympathy for the savages, for they deserve not. Murder is wrong for any reason. But terrorism is a different thing than a random shooting and requires a different response. Confusing the two would make our response less effective.

The definition of terrorism in the U.S. Code is a good starting point: “the term ‘terrorism’ means premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents…”

Legal definitions applied by the United States, United Kingdom, and many Western countries all include a requirement for terroristic violence to be “politically motivated.” There are substantive debates about whether violence against military personnel constitutes terrorism and whether violence perpetuated by the state should be considered terrorism (as the U.S. government’s definition excludes), but those questions are irrelevant to the shootings in question, all of which were conducted by non-state individuals and targeted civilians.

Some governments do have definitions of terrorism that are so broad as to include non-politically motivated violence, or non-violent political activism, that can result in the state arresting protesters on terrorism charges, but those undemocratic measures, like proposals to label the NRA terrorists, must be avoided in our constitutional republic.

We Talk This Way in Real Life, Too

Legal definitions are one thing, but language exists in the popular parlance as well. I propose that the definition requiring political motivation is right and should be accepted and used by the public. The end game of terrorism is not just to murder people. Rather, the murders are intended to intimidate us into acting in accord with the terrorist’s beliefs.

The murders are intended to intimidate us into acting in accord with the terrorist’s beliefs.

Think about the fatwa against “The Satanic Verses” or the murder of Theo van Gogh and the Charlie Hebdo attack. The point of each of those brutalities was to scare people into shutting up about Islam. They were largely successes insomuch as many media outlets have subsequently censored publication of newsworthy cartoons mocking Muhammad or Islam.

When James Holmes stepped into the theatre and pulled the trigger, spraying wildly at the 100 or so people watching “The Dark Knight,” what was his motivation? What was he trying to coerce people into doing or refraining from doing? Many of these shootings have no discernible ideological motivation. Perhaps they are inspired by a disturbed young man’s sexual frustration and sick need for fame after failing at life, as Tom Nichols argued here earlier this year. (That factor can also be coupled with ideologically motivated shootings.)

Whatever it is, in the case of the Aurora theatre shooting and most school shootings, the shooters usually do not leave evidence they picked their targets for broad political reasons that exist beyond themselves, and if they don’t have such motivations, their attacks will not have coercive effects beyond the carnage. If the target is chosen randomly and for no rational reason, then the victims would be just as at risk no matter where they were.

What This Means about Charleston and Colorado Springs

This means the Charleston shooting can be called terrorism based on what we know, and after more evidence comes out, the Planned Parenthood shooting could also turn out to be terrorism. Dylann Roof was quite clear that his motivation to attack an African-American church was racism. He attacked blacks as a race and railed specifically against miscegenation and “race mixing.” This shows his intent was to intimidate African-Americans, to make them feel unsafe in public places and in expressing themselves on racial issues.

Dylann Roof was quite clear that his motivation to attack an African-American church was racism.

The perpetrator of the Colorado Springs shooting was said by an unnamed authority to have referenced “baby parts” and expressed anti-abortion views in his interview. While the full information about his motive has not yet been released, this suggests he could have targeted Planned Parenthood, like Scott Roeder targeting George Tiller, in order to intimidate people out of getting or performing abortions. If that is indeed his motivation, then he too is a terrorist.

That those shootings were politically motivated makes them somewhat more significant in the public view. They might make someone who wants to use one of his constitutionally protected rights just a little bit more apprehensive about doing so. Terrorism is both an attack on the immediate victims’ rights to life and the public’s right to live their lives. We need a separate word to describe it.

Senator Ben Sasse: San Bernardino Attack Is An Act Of War,"In a speech from the Senate floor, Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) called the San Bernardino attack an act of war in an ongoing fight against radical Islam that Congress can no longer ignore.

“We are at war,” he said Tuesday night. “The American people already know this. Our enemies obviously know this… It is only this town that seems confused. Washington ignores what it cannot escape.”

“This is a clash of civilizations— a fight between free people and a totalitarian movement,” he said. “We are free and our enemies hate it…They hate us not because of any particular thing we have done, by omission or by commission; they hate us because of who we are. They hate us because we have a Constitution that enshrines our freedoms.”

Sasse noted that the best way to stop so-called Islamophobia is for Washington to stop jihadis from trying to blow up Americans.

“You want to stop Islamaphobia?” he asked. “Stop lecturing Americans that they’re supposedly stupid to be frightened about jihadis who actually do want to bomb their sporting event. And instead use your pen and phone as Commander-in-Chief to start telling us what your plan is to find and kill those who would do us harm.”

Although he didn’t specifically name Donald Trump, Sasse said the billionaire’s demagogic demands for blanket bans on Muslim immigration were driven in large part by the refusal of political leaders to even acknowledge the national security threat currently posed by violent Islamic terrorists.

“The people who are supposed to be laser-focused on defending the American people—that is us—mouth silly platitudes that show we’re either too weak or too confused to keep our people safe,” Sasse said from the Senate floor. “Then a megalomaniac strongman steps forward, and he starts screaming about travel bans and deportation, and offering promises to keep all of us safe, which to some and I think actually to many more than those of us in this body seem to understand, to some will sound much better than not being protected at all.”

Sasse’s remarks echoed a message he recorded from the site of the San Bernardino attacks last week, where he said that the 14 victims of the attack would not be the only ones to lose their lives in the ongoing fight for religious liberty. Telling the truth about the nature of the enemy and about ourselves is the best way to honor the victims who died at the hands of Islamic terrorists, Sasse said.

“This country invented religious liberty–we’re the most tolerant nation the world has ever seen,” he said. “Our people want a little less elite sermonizing about tolerance in our communities, and a little more articulation of our shared Constitutional principles – and a lot more articulating of an actual battle plan.”

“We should be clear about who we are and about the freedoms we stand for,” he said. “And we should be clear about those who would try to kill us because we believe in these freedoms.”

The Midwestern Republican senator also had no patience for those denied that the terrorists were driven by their beliefs about Islam.

“When we nonsensically say that our enemy has nothing to do with Islam or conversely that every Muslim is prejudged guilty – then our national conversation crumbles into simple sound and fury,” Sasse concluded. “That is not us. For we are Americans.”",https://thefederalist.com/2015/12/09/you-dont-want-to-miss-what-this-senator-said-about-the-san-bernardino-attack/,2015-12-09
Know Your Tropes For Exploiting Terrorism,"On Sunday, President Obama gave us another dull, rote speech on terrorism in which he promised to stay the course on whatever it is he thinks he’s doing about ISIS. And then lectured us about our intolerance.

It was notable for only one thing: the presidential adoption of the Exactly What ISIS Wants trope.

You know the one. If someone doesn’t like any particular response to the latest terrorist attack, he’ll tell you that this response is “exactly what ISIS wants.” It has been dreadfully popular since last month’s attacks in Paris, and it is threatening to become 2015’s answer to 2001’s trope, “Or the Terrorists Win.”

You remember that one, right? In case you don’t, here’s a handy guide to help you know your tropes for the political exploitation of terrorism.

‘Or The Terrorists Win’

This is the claim that people should engage in some utterly ordinary activity — shopping, watching television, eating bacon, etc. — as an act of defiance against terrorism. Because if they don’t do it, “then the terrorists win.”

This trope originated with exhortations from President Bush just after 9/11 for people to keep going about their normal lives in spite of the fear al-Qaeda wanted to instill in them. Which is reasonable enough, I suppose, but then it got out of hand. It was summed up by Ellen DeGeneres at the 2001 Emmy awards about two months after 9/11: “We’re told to go on living our lives as usual, because to do otherwise is to let the terrorists win, and really, what would upset the Taliban more than a gay woman wearing a suit in front of a room full of Jews?”

Note that in its pure form, Or the Terrorists Win is not about the need to pursue some actual foreign policy that might disrupt or defeat terrorists. It’s about asking us to “go on living our lives as usual” — which means that there is no activity too trivial or mundane that it cannot be recast as an act of defiance against terrorism.

Or the Terrorists Win is no longer a trope, strictly speaking, because it has become a running joke. No one uses it non-ironically any more.

But they are still oh-so-serious about knowing Exactly What ISIS Wants.

‘Exactly What ISIS Wants’

The bodies were barely cool in the Paris shootings when we were treated to lectures that “The West Is Giving ISIS Exactly What It Wants,” usually accompanied by very dubious projections of what ISIS wants, which just so happen to correspond to any policy proposed by someone on the American right.

Exactly What ISIS Wants may seem as if it is the opposite of Or the Terrorists Win. Or the Terrorists Win urges action to defy terrorism — albeit trivial and ineffectual — while Exactly What ISIS Wants demands inaction. But both effectively say the same thing: act as if the situation is normal, go on with our lives as if nothing happened. Or the Terrorists Win tells us to go shopping or hold awards ceremonies or whatever else we were already doing — even though many young men, thankfully, did disrupt their lives by volunteering to join the armed forces. Exactly What ISIS Wants tells us to change nothing about our policies toward terrorism, toward ISIS, toward Syria, toward refugees, or anything else — even if such changes might be warranted.

The purest, most absurd use of Exactly What ISIS Wants is to declare, “If we go to war, we’re doing exactly what the terrorists want.”

Y’all realize ISIS wants to provoke a war, right? If we go to war, we’re doing exactly what the terrorists want.— Sally Kohn (@sallykohn) November 16, 2015

Get that? Don’t destroy ISIS. Don’t bomb them, shoot them, or hunt them down like dogs. That’s exactly what they want!

As absurd as it may sound, this is the specific form Obama used in his appeal to Exactly What ISIS Wants: “We should not be drawn once more into a long and costly ground war in Iraq or Syria. That’s what groups like ISIL want.” To which he then adds: “They know they can’t defeat us on the battlefield.” Strange, then, that they would want to draw us into a war they know they can’t win, isn’t it? It reminds me of the famous Patton quote: “No bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country.” If terrorists are eager to die for their cause, why not accommodate them?

Surely it is possible that ISIS may not be the best judge of what is in its own interests, just as Japan was not the best judge of its interests when it bombed Pearl Harbor. Surely it is possible that talking heads who only sporadically discuss foreign policy are not the world’s foremost experts on exactly what ISIS does, in fact, want. And maybe we should decide our response to terrorism based on our own judgment of our interests, without worrying too much about what ISIS has to say on the matter.

Exactly What ISIS Wants is the black hole of arguments.

But Exactly What ISIS Wants is the black hole of arguments. It pulls any proposed action against terrorism into its gravitation field and sucks all motion and energy out of it. Which is interesting, because I’m pretty sure that dithering and inaction on our part is exactly what ISIS wants. It has certainly served their interests so far.

But we have not exhausted the tropes for the political exploitation of terrorism, not by a long shot. Exactly What ISIS Wants, for example, is merely an inverted version of Vicarious Terrorism.

‘Vicarious Terrorism’

Vicarious Terrorism is when you advocate responding to terrorism by taking away the grievances that motivate it — which means, in effect, granting the terrorists’ demands.

The person who makes this argument is not a supporter or sympathizer of the terrorist group in question and would never dream of committing an act of terrorism himself. It’s just that the terrorists’ supposed grievances happen to correspond in some way to his pre-existing agenda, and he just can’t help using the attack to promote that agenda.

Some of the most garish examples of Vicarious Terrorism come not from the left but from the right (sort of). In his 2007 book “The Enemy at Home,” for example, Dinesh D’Souza declared, “The cultural left in this country…is responsible for causing 9/11” because it is “the primary cause of the volcano of anger toward America that is erupting from the Islamic world.” It is our decadent, godless, secular lifestyle that enrages Muslim fanatics, and gosh, they really have a point.

Note that D’Souza, whatever else you might think of him, is not the sort of person who would go on a shooting spree or plan a bombing campaign against those liberal heathens. He would never be a terrorist himself. But he does advocate the suppression of leftist secularism — a goal that just happens to coincide with his own ideological prejudices — as an answer to terrorism.

Or consider Ron Paul, who has developed the unfortunate habit of quoting Osama bin Laden as an authority on U.S. foreign policy. In 2007, he told the Des Moines Register:

Have you ever read about the reasons they attacked us? They attack us because we’ve been over there. We’ve been bombing Iraq for 10 years. We’ve been in the Middle East…. I’m suggesting that we listen to the people who attacked us, and the reason they did it and they are delighted that we’re over there, because Osama bin Laden has said, “I am glad you’re over on our sand, because we can target you so much easier.”

Before going to war in Syria was Exactly What ISIS Wants, fighting al-Qaeda in Afghanistan was exactly what Bin Laden wanted.

In both of these examples, the proposals obviously amount to appeasement: assuage the enemy’s anger by meeting his demands, either for the persecution of infidels or for American disengagement from the Middle East. But what makes them examples of Vicarious Terrorism is that the appeasement is repackaged as a way of undermining terrorism rather than giving in to it.

Tropes are always used to justify a pre-existing agenda.

One of the common threads among these tropes — the thing that makes them tropes — is the fact that they are always used to justify a pre-existing agenda. They are less a response to terrorism than an attempt to exploit terrorism to promote or defend an existing political program. In one variant of this trope, that becomes even clearer.

When Ron Paul used the same argument in response to the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris in January, I noted an important difference. He asserted that the cause of the attack was Muslims’ anger at French intervention in the Middle East and West Africa. But this motive was Paul’s own invention. The attackers themselves shouted that they were targeting the French magazine because of its blasphemous depictions of their prophet. As I put it, “Ron Paul wants to overrule the Islamists’ own statement of their motives,” substituting invented motives that correspond better to his own agenda.

That makes this a whole new trope, and one that has also been taken up by Obama in his response to ISIS. I call it Bin Laden Syndrome by Proxy.

‘Bin Laden Syndrome By Proxy’

In Bin Laden Syndrome by Proxy, you take someone else’s terrorist attack, fantasize what you think its causes and motives ought to be according to your world view, then advocate a response intended to address this pretended cause.

In Vicarious Terrorism, the terrorists’ real motives and agenda have some overlap with your own, and you succumb to the temptation to exaggerate the connection and use the attacks to promote your agenda. But in Bin Laden Syndrome by Proxy, the overlap is entirely a product of your own imagination, spurred by naked opportunism.

Probably the best example I have ever seen of Bin Laden Syndrome by Proxy is giving a speech after an ISIS-inspired terrorist attack in which you tell the American people that gun control is now “a matter of national security” — which is exactly what Obama just did. Obviously, he did not start wanting to ban “assault weapons” because a couple of terrorists used them last week. He’s been advocating it all along as his standard response to domestic shootings by crazy people with no ideological motive at all. But these shootings haven’t mobilized the public to support gun control, so he repackaged his argument to connect it to an issue on which people do seem to want strong action.

Then again, maybe that’s not the very best example, because it’s hard to top “climate change caused the Paris attacks.”

What unites Exactly What ISIS Wants and Bin Laden Syndrome by Proxy is that they both help the user avoid addressing the essential cause behind the current terrorism threat: the religion of Islam. This avoidance has spawned a whole constellation of tropes, starting with the assertion that the Islamic State and Islamic terrorism have Nothing to Do with Islam.

‘Nothing To Do With Islam’

“This has nothing to do with Islam” is a standard description for anything bad done by a Muslim in the name of Islam, based on arguments offered by Islamic imams citing quotations from Islamic scripture.

Hence Hillary’s Clinton’s assurance that “Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism” — in response to attacks in Paris by Muslims who were not peaceful or tolerant and had something to do with terrorism.

This is a variant of The Religion of Peace.

‘The Religion Of Peace’

The Religion of Peace is the religion that did not motivate the San Bernardino shootings, the Paris attacks, the Charlie Hebdo massacre, the Fort Hood shootings, the beheading of hostages in Syria, the mass execution of policemen and soldiers in Iraq, the shooting schoolgirls in the head, and so on and on. It definitely didn’t motivate the 9/11 attacks, and that is why it is not even supposed to be mentioned at the Ground Zero museum.

Must be some other faith. Try the Presbyterians.

The purest examples of either trope are when non-Muslims — who endow themselves with the authority to speak on behalf of somebody else’s religion — offer assurances about the essential peaceful and tolerant nature of Islam. This culminates in No True Muslim.

‘No True Muslim’

This is a variant on the No True Scotsman trope. In its original inspiration, this is a type of circular reasoning used by a Scotsman to endow his countryman with some particular, virtuous quality. When confronted with the counter-example of a Scot who fails to possess this virtue, he merely declares that the miscreant must be “no true Scotsman.”

In this case, the trope is used by a non-Muslim to disavow the association of Muslims with any negative qualities — particularly religiously motivated violence — by asserting that anyone who commits such violence must be No True Muslim.

Thus, when a British Muslim began stabbing people the London subway and declared, “This is for Syria,” an onlooker was recorded telling the attacker, in impeccable London slang, “You ain’t no Muslim, bruv!”

Tropes are tools of mental laziness and evasion, intended to help us to stick to our prejudices in the face of inconvenient facts.

The person who said this has not been identified, so he may himself have been Muslim, which is not a perfect example of the trope. What is a perfect example of the trope is British Prime Minister David Cameron taking up the slogan and responding, “Some of us have dedicated speeches and media appearances and sound bites and everything on this subject, but ‘You ain’t no Muslim, bruv,’ said it all much better than I ever could.” Amazing, isn’t it, that a white British Christian’s assertions about the peaceful nature of Islam don’t seem to have had much effect?

But as Hillary Clinton explained above, describing Islamic terrorists as Muslims would “play into their hands.” It is Exactly What ISIS Wants.

You see how it all fits together. If we can’t admit to the real motive of Islamic terrorists or address their actual strategic goals, we need to invent new motives and goals and use these polite fictions to dictate what actions are acceptable and unacceptable as a response. And if we’re going to do that, we might as well invent motives and responses that allow us to remain comfortably in the rut of our established domestic political routine.

In declaring that No True Muslim is inspired by the Religion of Peace to engage in terrorism, which has Nothing to Do with Islam, we invite ourselves to engage in Bin Laden Syndrome by Proxy, because otherwise we might be tempted to do Exactly What ISIS Wants. We had better continue along undisturbed in our pre-existing routine, Or the Terrorists Win.

In literature and drama, it may be the case that Tropes Are Not Bad, but in politics, they usually are. They are tools of mental laziness and evasion, intended to help us to stick to our prejudices in the face of inconvenient facts. Which makes it all the more important to know your tropes.

Why Does Obama Contradict What His Government Says About Terrorism?,"In the wake of the Paris and San Bernardino attacks, President Obama has consistently told the American people three things:

1. ISIS is contained.

2. His current strategy to defeat ISIS is working and will ultimately succeed.

3. The San Bernardino terror suspects do not appear to be a part of a larger global conspiracy to threaten the homeland.

At this point, it’s fair to ask, “Where is Obama getting his information?” because government officials have been saying the opposite of these talking points for quite some time. This week, agencies have begun to take matters into their own hands and ramp up efforts to combat terrorism. Clearly, this goes against the White House’s reassurances that the threat is being contained.

ISIS Is Not At All Contained

The notion that ISIS is contained and Obama’s current strategy is winning the fight against terror has been largely debunked. Several weeks before the San Bernardino attack, intelligence reports warned the White House that ISIS was gaining traction, and it would continue to spread globally unless it lost significant territory on battlegrounds in Iraq and Syria, The Daily Beast reported.

Even now, Obama refuses to acknowledge intelligence contradicting what he says in public.

The report — which the Obama administration itself requested — was issued before the Paris and San Bernardino attacks, and well before Obama assured the nation that ISIS is “contained.” So it’s curious the president decided to use that word when describing the situation to the American public, as it contradicted the information we now know was available to him at the time.

Wednesday morning, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter saidISIS was not contained during his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee. His words contrast starkly to the narrative the president has been pumping out.

For some context, consider the president’s Oval Office address, in which he said there’s no evidence the suspected San Bernardino terrorists were directed by ISIS or “part of a broader conspiracy here at home.”

He also alluded to ramping up efforts to fight jihadists abroad. However, the steps he outlined to combat ISIS seem largely unchanged from the strategy, which has been failing for quite some time. By now, it’s clear that air strikes and climate change talks are not working. ISIS is gaining — not losing — influence in the global sphere. According to intelligence analysts working at the president’s disposal, the best way to counter ISIS is to ensure that it suffers serious territorial losses on the battlefield. So why isn’t Obama listening?

Why is it so difficult for him to accept that the actions taken in San Bernardino are in fact part of a larger conspiracy at work: to exterminate those who hold Western ideals of freedom and establish a global caliphate ruled by Sharia law? And why isn’t he willing to try a new strategy?

Is Obama Still Insulated From the Truth About the War On Terror?

There’s another example of the Obama administration’s tendency to ignore intelligence that contradicts a desired public narrative. Earlier this year, analysts came forward to publicly reveal that the U.S. military’s Central Command was selectively editing information gathered about the war on terror. The analysts claimed higher-ups altered reports before sending them to the White House so the intelligence would match a more favorable public narrative.

The best way to counter ISIS is to ensure that it suffers serious territorial losses on the battlefield. So why isn’t Obama listening?

We don’t know exactly how high this intelligence cover-up goes. It isn’t clear if Obama fostered a culture that drove higher-ups within the intelligence community to pass along only good news, or if those close to the president tried to insulate him from the truth. Or if perhaps intelligence higher-ups did it for their own self-serving purposes.

Regardless of where the directives to edit intelligence came from, it’s clear Obama wasn’t getting the truth for quite some time, which casts a shadow on his tenure in office and his decisions today as commander in chief.

Even now, Obama refuses to acknowledge intelligence contradicting what he says in public. Last year, an estimated 250 Americans attempted to join ISIS. This number has spiked significantly from the 100 Americans who tried to join militant Islamists overseas last year. These figures don’t include the number of U.S. citizens who have been radicalized here, like the terrorists behind the Boston bombing and the Fort Hood attack. Yet, as recently as Sunday, Obama affirmed the notion that we are succeeding in our efforts to combat ISIS.

Perhaps he is so insulated within the walls of his Pennsylvania Avenue residence that he’s unable to gain access to the truth. Or, worse, he may actually believe he possesses the ability to dictate reality. Whatever the case may be, Obama’s unchanged public narrative — that his strategy is working to defeat ISIS — is cause for alarm.

Government Agencies Are Going Rogue To Protect Americans

The secretary of Defense isn’t the only government official to speak in direct opposition to the White House’s narrative, either. The Department of Homeland Security announced earlier this week that in the wake of the San Bernardino attack — the deadliest terrorist attack since 9/11 — it will launch an emergency alert system warning civilians of terror threats.

It’s both an interesting mystery and an alarming question as to where the president has been getting his information on terror.

This announcement is revealing for two reasons: first, the need for an emergency alert system indicates DHS expects more terror activity to occur on U.S. soil. This directly defies the notion that ISIS is contained. Second, it suggests the San Bernardino attack could be part of a larger conspiracy against U.S. civilians that continues to endanger American lives. If last week’s attack was, as Obama said, a lone wolf shooting that wasn’t directed by overseas terrorists, then why is the government preparing for more attacks? Does Obama think Americans won’t notice that his narrative contradicts with DHS’s actions?

The source of Obama’s intelligence, which is driving his decisions in combatting ISIS, doesn’t seem to be coming from the DOD, DHS, or intelligence agencies. So it’s both an interesting mystery and an alarming question as to where the president has been getting his information on terror.

In any case, it’s clear there’s an apparent breakdown in communication between intelligence officials and the White House when it comes to fighting terrorism. While the cause of this breakdown is anyone’s guess, we can’t hope to defeat ISIS until it is repaired.

"In Memory Of My Brother, Who Died In The San Bernardino Attack","He was killed by Muslim terrorists in San Bernardino on December 2, along with 13 other people. He was 42. He was laid to rest earlier today.

The top picture is of Daniel Kaufman. Nobody ever called him Larry. He was named after the Elton John song. And he was my brother. Adopted, that’s why his name is different; he was my cousin by birth. My parents adopted him when he was 10 and I was 7. He taught me how to tie my shoelaces. He taught me how to shave. The one at left was the last picture he texted me, on November 7. He’s giving the Vulcan salute because he was at a place in Van Nuys which was used as a filming location in Star Trek.

Danny, as I always called him, was a deeply kind and gentle man. He had a soft spot all his life for sick plants or animals. He was always rescuing some injured cat or bird, or keeping a potato in a cup of water so it would grow. He brought home an injured duck once, and we let it live in our pool. Everything you’ve heard about what a cheerful and gregarious person he was is true. He also loved horror movies and Comic Con and Clive Barker novels and George Takei Facebook posts. He especially loved the Renaissance Faire. His life basically revolved around it and his boyfriend, Ryan.

You might only imagine my parents’ sorrow. I would recommend against trying to.

For myself, I’ve often thought since that day of a passage from Mark Twain, in which he tells how he reacted when he learned that his favorite daughter, Susy, had died. “It is one of the mysteries of our nature that a man, all unprepared, can receive a thunder-stroke like that and live,” he writes.

There is but one reasonable explanation of it. The intellect is stunned by the shock, and but gropingly gathers the meaning of the words. The power to realize their full import is mercifully wanting. The mind has a dumb sense of vast loss—that is all. It will take mind and memory months, and possibly years, to gather together the details, and thus learn and know the whole extent of the loss. A man’s house burns down. The smoking wreckage represents only a ruined home that was dear through years of use and pleasant associations. By and by, as the days and weeks go on, first he misses this, then that, then the other thing. And, when he casts about for it, he finds that it was in that house. Always it is an essential—there was but one of its kind. It cannot be replaced. It was in that house. It is irrevocably lost. He did not realize that it was an essential when he had it; he only discovers it now when he finds himself balked, hampered, by its absence. It will be years before the tale of lost essentials is complete, and not till then can he truly know the magnitude of his disaster.

Our own disaster is worsened by the fact that this is such a big news story. We’ve chosen not to speak to the press, or attend any public memorial services. We hope this is not taken as a sign of disrespect. We loved Danny, and always will, and are exceedingly grateful to his many friends for their kindness. We are grateful, too, for the many police, sheriff, and fire officials of the city and county of San Bernardino, and the FBI, who’ve tried to help. Different people grieve in different ways.

There Are a Few Things I Would Like to Clarify.

First, although Danny was gay, he was not killed for that reason. The jihadists certainly didn’t stop to ask. Danny was a human being capable of thought and love. That was enough to make him dear to us—and to make him a target for jihad. There are rumors he was Jewish. He was not.

There are also rumors that he saved some people’s lives during the attacks. I know of no evidence to support this, and rumors of this sort tend to circulate at such times, but it would certainly have been in character. However that may be, nobody’s life should be weighed on the basis of its last few seconds. The reason we miss Danny was his cheerfulness, compassion, and capacity for love throughout his 42 years. He was a man and a brother.

Political questions should not be decided on the basis of emotion. Gun rights and other constitutional issues should be subject to rational thought, based on ethics, law, history, and politics.

Second, our family does not believe in the supernatural in any way; quite the contrary. But we also do not object to or resent the offers we’ve had from many kind people to pray for us. Indeed, I was shocked and disappointed that some of my fellow atheists rushed in their sadness to insult those who made such offers. As Shakespeare says, we receive offered love like love, and will not wrong it. We appreciate the thoughtfulness of our religious friends, and we celebrate the freedom of, and from, religion that jihadists would destroy.

Third, my family has always believed, and still believes, that all people everywhere have a fundamental right to possess guns for self-defense, against criminals as well as against the government; that this right is enshrined on an equal footing with other essential rights in our Constitution, and that all elected officials are bound by oath to respect and protect it. Efforts to disarm law-abiding people, such as are now underway, are counterproductive and wrong. Danny shared our belief on this matter.

But we also believe that political questions should not be decided on the basis of emotion. Gun rights and other constitutional issues should be subject to rational thought, based on ethics, law, history, and politics. Emotional demands to “do something!” are just begging for irresponsible lawmaking. We also recognize that the fact that our loved one happened to believe in gun rights does not make our views either more or less credible than they were before his death. Those interested in the right to possess firearms should study the relevant constitutional history and so forth—not react based on feelings.

Our own belief is as it has always been: that gun control laws are largely unconstitutional, and mostly ineffective. They certainly were in this case. I would suggest that those who agree with us consider making a contribution to the Second Amendment Foundation, the nation’s best and most effective organization devoted to protecting this crucial constitutional right.

The U.S. Needs To Defeat The Enemy

Fourth, I believe there is no solution to the jihadist threat short of victory against our enemies. When attacked, one has a basic choice: one can curtail one’s own behavior, in hopes that the enemy can be persuaded not to attack again—or one can accept the challenge, and defeat that enemy.

The United States has so far largely chosen the former. For years now, officials of both parties have refused to face the fact that we are targeted by theocratic totalitarian movement, funded and overseen by Saudi Arabia and Iran, among others, which is committed to the destruction of the values essential to civilization. Our current president believes that the war against Islamofascism should be “ended.” But wars are never “ended.” They are either won or lost. Unless we accept the responsibility of victory, attacks like this—like Fort Hood, like Chattanooga, like Little Rock, like Los Angeles, Boston, Garland, Madrid, London, Bali, New Delhi, Delhi, Delhi again, Paris, Paris again, and so many others, including, of course, New York City—will only continue.

War is horrible. But it is not the worst horror. A life without freedom or law is still worse.

War is horrible. But it is not the worst horror. A life without freedom or law is still worse. Peace, said Churchill, cannot be “preserved by praising its virtues.” Nor by lowering flags to half-staff, reading lists of victims’ names, putting “coexist” bumper stickers on your car, having James Taylor play at your press conferences, etc. That may feel nice, but the future of freedom, peace, and civilization requires more than hugs and hashtags. It demands that we compel the Islamist aggressor, who has warred against us since 1979, to cease making war and accept peace on civilized terms.

Our family agrees with the sentiment expressed by Christopher Hitchens: “We might practice nailing the colors to the mast rather than engaging in a permanent dress rehearsal for masochism and the lachrymose.” It is for this reason that we choose not to participate in public demonstrations of mourning.

Those of us who also serve by only standing and waiting must respond in just the way that our enemy most despises: by living our lives exactly as we would have done. That means cherishing our freedom; celebrating our secular, free institutions; relishing the pleasures of life as physical beings; respecting the special spark in each individual person—here, in this world, during this life. Our values triumph each time we exercise them.

Danny and I watched the attacks of September 11, 2001, together on the TV in our living room. I can say with certainty that—to the extent that so kind a man was capable of understanding such evil—he believed in defying the barbarian by living just as we choose: freely, tolerantly, skeptically, joyfully, laughingly, humanly. After the (most recent) Paris attack, Danny enjoyed watching over and over again this well-known video by Andrew Neil. It expresses very well what he believed, and what our family believes.

Do Some Good In This World

Finally, many people have asked what they can do to honor Danny’s memory. I think the best answer is, do some good in this world. I have some suggestions: First, an organization called the RESCU Foundation provides health care assistance to people who participate in the Renaissance Faire. Danny himself contributed to them on occasion. Second, he loved and cared for animals all his life, and our family often faced the sad prospect of being unable to afford veterinarian bills. The Pet Fund is a nationwide charity devoted to helping people pay for health care for their pet friends. A donation in Danny’s name to either of these groups would be a fine way to celebrate his kindness.

For centuries, people have pondered the meaning of evil. But the solution to the riddle is that evil has no meaning. Evil is the absence of meaning; it is meaninglessness.

As Ryan said, “The world will suffer from having one less person like him in it.” You might also consider supporting the Ayaan Hirsi Ali Foundation, as our family does, to oppose a primitive ideology that reduces women to the status of slaves.

For centuries, people have pondered the meaning of evil. But the solution to the riddle is that evil has no meaning. Evil is the absence of meaning; it is meaninglessness. To build, to create, to act in the world—these all have meaning. Evil cannot. It is only a black hole that can tear apart meaningful things, and return them to the hollow silence of the universe.

This is what we mean when we say that evil is “banal.” It lacks the infinite grandeur of even a grain of sand, let alone of laughter, or of a kiss. In that sense, evil does not matter. It is incapable of mattering. It cannot live or mean things. The best it can do is look on in ire, envy, and despair. And the envious are always walled off from the world that we, the living, inhabit, by an invisible and impervious barrier that they erect themselves; they always have the deadly touch of King Midas.

We defy evil and envy when we live. Living in this world sheds light into darkness. It is all we can do, and all that needs to be done, and it is more than enough. Therefore, we shall live. We shall be joyful, hard-working, silly, creative, and smart and sexy and brave and fun. Be a brief candle that helps spread another light.

My family appreciates you respecting their privacy and not contacting them directly. But we would like to hear from people who knew Danny and would like to participate in a memorial project we’re working on. Any and all messages you would like to convey must be sent to me at tmsandefur@gmail.com.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/12/11/in-memory-of-my-brother-who-died-in-the-san-bernardino-attack/,2015-12-11
4 Things To Watch For During Tonight’s GOP Debate,"Republican presidential candidates square off in the final debate of 2015 at 8:30 p.m. EST tonight on CNN. You can watch a live stream of the debate here. As we close out 2015 and get closer to the first contests in Iowa and New Hampshire in February, polls show that Trump has a commanding lead nationally, Cruz has jumped into the lead in Iowa, and Marco Rubio seems to be making a move in New Hampshire.

So what should we expect to see during the CNN debate tonight in Las Vegas?

1) Cruz Is Now The Iowa Frontrunner

Since receiving the endorsements of key social conservatives in Iowa, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has rocketed into the lead in the Hawkeye State. The widely respected Selzer poll released by the Des Moines Register over the weekend shows Cruz with a 10-point lead over Trump in Iowa.

Over the last six weeks, support for Cruz in Iowa has nearly tripled, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average. The junior Texas senator has gone from less than 10 percent support in October to a current polling average of 26 percent. While anything is possible in politics, it appears that Cruz is likely heading for a victory in the Iowa caucus on February 1.

As a result, don’t expect Cruz to go hard after the other candidates during the debate tonight. There may be a jab here or there, but Cruz has no incentive to pick a big fight with anyone. His likely goal is to cement his position in Iowa and use a victory there to give him some momentum going into New Hampshire, an open primary state where Cruz is currently in fourth place.

2) Carson Begins To Fade Away

Cruz’s big jump in Iowa has come entirely at the expense of pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Since late October, Cruz’s support in Iowa has risen by 17 percent, while Carson’s has dropped by 17 percent. While Carson still has the best favorability numbers in the state–74 percent of likely caucus-goers in Iowa have a favorable impression of him–his topline polling numbers just aren’t keeping up. One big reason may be the recent terrorist attacks in Sen Bernardino, California. In the most recent Quinnipiac poll in Iowa, voters said terrorism was their top issue heading into the February caucus. Unfortunately for Carson, only 3 percent of those polled said he was the best candidate to handle the terrorism issue.

The social conservative endorsements of Cruz came at the worst possible time for Carson. Just as conservative voters were beginning to reevaluate whether Carson could handle the job as commander-in-chief, Cruz got a big thumbs up from state leaders deeply respected by a big chunk of conservative Iowa Republicans. The result? A big switch from the eminently likeable Ben Carson to the perhaps safer and more credible Ted Cruz.

Expect Carson to try and address those concerns about his ability to handle national security and foreign policy issues. He most likely won’t attack other candidates–that’s just not his style–but he’ll need to do something big to show that he’s up to the task when it comes to terrorism. If he can’t pull that off, then you’ll see even more of his supporters head over to Cruz’s camp.

3) Trump Doesn’t Like Being A Loser

Donald Trump’s a winner. He wins at things all the time. But it’s increasingly looking like he’s going to be a loser in Iowa. So how will that affect Trump’s strategy during the GOP debate tonight?

My guess is that he’ll go hard after Ted Cruz. Trump has never been one to employ subtle rhetorical strategies. He’s big and bombastic and he’ll say whatever he needs to say to get attention right now. He has to blunt Cruz’s momentum.

Why? Because it’s not impossible to imagine Iowa being the beginning of the end of Trump’s run for the White House. If a sizable percentage of Trump’s supporters don’t actually show up to vote for him in the Iowa caucus on February 1, it’s possible that Cruz could win the state going away, Rubio could end up with a strong second place showing, Carson might hold on to third place, with Trump ending up in fourth. Sure, Trump currently has a big lead in New Hampshire, but everything in New Hampshire changes once the Iowa results are in. A Trump faceplant in Iowa might spell the end of Trump’s lead in New Hampshire, especially if Rubio can figure out a way to top him in Iowa.

Donald Trump’s going to do everything in his power to make sure that scenario never materializes. Cruz is now his top threat, making Cruz his top target. If Cruz is smart, he’ll find ways to agree with or co-opt Trump. I’ll be surprised if Cruz fires directly back–he has no real incentive to get down in the mud with Trump–but anything can happen.

4) Rubio Needs To Make A Move In Iowa To Avoid Giuliani’s Fate

Despite sky-high favorability ratings in Iowa and the belief among many strategists and pundits that he represents the Republican party’s best hope in 2016, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio doesn’t have a polling lead anywhere. Not nationally, not in Iowa, not in New Hampshire, not in South Carolina, not in Nevada. The map is quickly becoming his biggest opponent, which is why so many professional primary watchers are worried that Rubio may have a Rudy Giuliani problem: yeah, it’s nice that everyone in the know thinks you’re the best, but at some point you actually have to win a primary or two to remain viable.

Current New Hampshire polls show Rubio in second place in the state, but he’s still a long way behind Trump. So what can he do that change that? He needs a strong showing in Iowa. A win seems unlikely, but a second place finish might be possible if Carson’s poll numbers continue to drop and Trump’s shine begins to fade. Rubio needs a lot of momentum coming out of Iowa if he wants a shot at winning New Hampshire. And he needs a big showing in New Hampshire, perhaps even a win, if he wants to stay competitive ahead of the so-called SEC primary in March.

While Rubio might be able to siphon away votes from Bush and Fiorina, and maybe even Carson, he probably won’t have much luck convincing Trump supporters to join Team Marco. That means Rubio will have to go directly at Cruz. Rubio is viewed skeptically by immigration hard-liners, so he may try to attack Cruz from the right on immigration. In the wake of the San Bernardino terrorist attacks, Rubio–an unapologetic interventionist–will almost certainly attack Cruz on national security. The Wall Street Journal‘s Bret Stephens previewed that very attack in an editorial published on Monday night, claiming that Cruz’s and Obama’s foreign policy visions are indistinguishable.

Will Republican debate watchers buy that line of attack? If so, will it make a big enough dent in Cruz’s standing to give Rubio a shot at a second place finish in Iowa?",https://thefederalist.com/2015/12/15/4-things-to-watch-for-during-tonights-gop-debate/,2015-12-15
"We’re All Being Pretty Quiet About Obama’s Failures, Aren’t We?","President Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign was built on the claim that he was not just tough on terrorists, but also he was successful in fighting them. “President Obama has placed the killing of Osama bin Laden at the center of his reelection effort,” began one Washington Post story about the effort.

Vice President Joe Biden was sent out on the campaign trail to repeat the mantra daily: “Osama bin Laden is dead, and General Motors is alive!”

And it wasn’t just bin Laden. The campaign wanted to emphasize how successful Obama’s strategy was when it came to containing Islamist terrorism. Throughout the 2012 campaign, Obama described al Qaeda as being “on the path to defeat” or “decimated.” One media outlet counted 32 instances of him saying this even after the al Qaeda-linked attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya killed a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.

At a campaign stop in Colorado, he said, “Four years ago, I promised to end the war in Iraq — and we did. I said we’d wind down the war in Afghanistan — and we are. And while a new tower rises above the New York skyline, al Qaeda is on the path to defeat, and Osama bin Laden is dead.”

A seven-minute video that made the case for re-electing Obama includes the now-even-more-outlandish promise that 32 million uninsured Americans would be covered under Obamacare by 2016, along with various other domestic claims. The foreign policy section touted an Obama speech where he said, “and now the war in Iraq is over,” and “for nearly nine years, our nation has been at war in Iraq. As your Commander-in-Chief and on behalf of a grateful nation, I’m finally proud to say these two words, ‘Welcome home.'” Graphics that read, “Iraq War Ended,” and “Libya Liberated” flashed across the screen.

The media carried the message forward. Al Qaeda was on the run. When the GOP presidential nominee talked about Russia being a major geopolitical threat, Obama chided him: “The 1980s are calling, they want their foreign policy back.” Snap! Zing! The media loved it. They bought the claim that Benghazi was not an orchestrated, successful, Islamist terror attack so much as a very good reason to re-evaluate the First Amendment in the U.S. They bought the Sunday morning show talking points and carried the candidate to victory.

Can you even imagine such journalistic avoidance under the Bush administration?

Cut to not even two weeks ago when 14 Americans were brutally killed in San Bernardino, California, and another 22 injured by Islamist terrorists Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik. This was the deadliest such terror attack on American soil since September 11, 2001.

There has been a smattering of in-depth media coverage in the aftermath, including local reporting by the Los Angeles Times, and some solid investigations into the federal bureaucracy’s inability to prevent these attacks by The New York Times. But you’d be forgiven for darkly laughing at one wag’s observation from Twitter:

“How The Murder of 14 American Civilians on Our Own Soil Doesn’t Reflect Badly On Obama In Any Way Whatsoever” ~ every article today



Will Antonin (@Will_Antonin) December 7, 2015

Indeed! The media have seemed willing to go in any direction but there. Maybe the problem is people praying to God for mercy, some with actual jobs in the media suggested. Others went to their quasi-religious discussions of gun control. Many have stayed there. Still others have responded to Donald Trump’s every utterance with codependent yelps and squeals. Anywhere, anywhere, but a discussion of Obama’s handling of national security as it relates to Islamist terrorists. Can you even imagine such journalistic avoidance under the Bush administration? Particularly, seven long years into the Bush administration? Let’s look at a few Obama talking points that very quietly took a beating in recent weeks.

Women Can’t Be Terrorists

Shortly after ISIS’ horrifically deadly attack throughout Paris a month ago, Obama responded to concerns about terrorists exploiting refugee and immigration paths to entry to the U.S. In an odd press conference in the immediate aftermath of Paris, the president sounded detached and disinterested, except when he mocked Republicans for expressing such concern. Later, in the Philippines, he revised and extended those remarks. Here’s a sample:

Speaking to reporters Wednesday morning in the Philippines, Obama scoffed at attempts to block refugees following the Paris terror attacks as “political posturing” that “needs to stop.” “Apparently they are scared of widows and orphans coming into the United States of America,” Obama said of Republicans. “At first, they were too scared of the press being too tough on them in the debates. Now they are scared of three year old orphans. That doesn’t seem so tough to me.”

Whenever he talked about Paris — an attack, which investigators suspect, saw some terrorists exploit refugee systems in Europe — Obama seemed more passionate about making fun of Republicans who worried about terrorists exploiting refugee systems. He kept making the point that women and children are nothing to fear. It’s of course true that most Islamist terrorists are male. But women can also commit acts of terrorism, as was the case in San Bernardino when Malik and her husband killed and injured so many innocent Americans. Obama quickly dropped the taunts about fearing women, but no media called him on it.

We Vet Immigrants Well

Another claim made repeatedly by the Obama administration was that people were stupid idiots to be worried about terrorists exploiting entry pathways to the country on account of how good our vetting is. When the Republicans in Congress worked on a bill to improve the process of vetting refugees from Syria, the White House issued yet another — yet another! — veto threat. The statement began:

The Administration’s highest priority is to ensure the safety and security of the American people. That is why refugees of all nationalities, including Syrians and Iraqis, considered for admission to the United States undergo the most rigorous and thorough security screening of anyone admitted into the United States…. The current screening process involves multiple Federal intelligence, security, and law enforcement agencies, including the National Counterterrorism Center, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS), State, and Defense, all aimed at ensuring that those admitted do not pose a threat to our country.

And so on and so forth. Media coverage — which included numerous stories trying to guilt critics by making Biblically questionable comparisons with the Holy Family — strongly suggested that skeptics were evil. Either way, if poor, vulnerable refugees are vetted this much, surely we must be vetting regular immigrants even more, right? Bad news. One of the San Bernardino murderers came into the country on a fiancé visa. Her tough application included questions such as, and I’m not joking:

“Are you a member or representative of a terrorist organization?”

“Have you ever ordered, incited, committed, assisted or otherwise participated in genocide?”

“Have you ever committed, ordered, incited, assisted or otherwise participated in torture?”

I mean, what answers do they think they’re going to get? The New York Times further reports that the murderer was openly calling for violence against the U.S., but we totally missed it because of how bad our vetting is:

WASHINGTON — Tashfeen Malik, who with her husband carried out the massacre in San Bernardino, Calif., passed three background checks by American immigration officials as she moved to the United States from Pakistan. None uncovered what Ms. Malik had made little effort to hide — that she talked openly on social media about her views on violent jihad. She said she supported it. And she said she wanted to be a part of it… Had the authorities found the posts years ago, they might have kept her out of the country. But immigration officials do not routinely review social media as part of their background checks, and there is a debate inside the Department of Homeland Security over whether it is even appropriate to do so.

ABC News also reported that a “Secret US Policy Blocks Agents From Looking at Social Media of Visa Applicants, Former Official Says.” Remember how much crap we gave President Bush for his “heckuva job, Brownie” comments in the aftermath of Katrina? Well, heckuva job everyone responsible for vetting new Americans. You couldn’t be doing better. A++ work.

But back to Obama. He issued a veto threat after claiming we couldn’t do any better at screening people. Turns out we’re asking them to volunteer information about how bad they are and respecting the “privacy” of their public comments calling for violent jihad. And yet, the media undoubtedly spent 200 times more time talking about whatever a certain floppy-haired presidential candidate muttered than this. Seriously, we saw the media make fun of Trump’s claim that he’d screen Muslim visitors by simply asking them whether they were Muslim. And rightly so, because that’s a plan that makes no sense. It’s also exactly what we were doing to screen out threats — asking people to tell us whether they were one — but the breathless and concerned coverage about the policies of an actual administration currently in power seems notably lacking.

ISIS Is No Biggie, Everything Is Awesome

As we discussed at the beginning, a major theme of Obama’s presidency has been that Al Qaeda’s on the run, ISIS is the JV team, they’re totally contained, and we’re going to stay the course while fighting them. This is quite obviously wrong to everyone outside of most newsrooms. Also, Obama has claimed that we’re out of Afghanistan and Iraq. Except that we’re in no way out of Afghanistan and Iraq. In October, he announced that the U.S. would keep 10,000 troops in Afghanistan, contrary to the campaign promise he’d end the war there. On December 6, the Los Angeles Times rather softly noted, “The Obama administration quietly announced a significant new escalation in its war against Islamic State last week: It’s deploying U.S. special operations troops on the ground in Iraq and Syria to go after leaders of the Islamist movement.” And yet again, the media aren’t particularly concerned. During the Bush administration, newscasts ended with solemn music and a scroll of the names of men and women who had died fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. Newspapers ran sections listing the dead. Yet for some reason, the media coverage of the cost of such wars has been eerily quiet, even though 75 percent of the soldiers killed in Afghanistan have been killed during Obama’s time in office.

Protecting The Homeland

A Gallup poll just came out showing that American concern about terrorism has spiked:

Americans are more worried about terrorism than they have been in a long time https://t.co/A2XjpsHCm1 pic.twitter.com/p5zpj5nchK Aaron Blake (@AaronBlakeWP) December 15, 2015

A Wall Street Journal poll shows similar results:

Heightened fear of terrorism is rippling through the electorate, thrusting national-security issues to the center of the 2016 presidential campaign, according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released on the eve of Republicans’ latest presidential debate.



Some 40% of those polled say national security and terrorism should be the government’s top priority, and more than 60% put it in the top two, up from just 39% eight months ago.

A whopping 70 percent say the country is “on the wrong track,” and 60 percent disapprove of Obama’s handling of ISIS.

Meanwhile, more than 50 intelligence analysts working out of the U.S. military’s Central Command “have formally complained that their reports on ISIS and al Qaeda’s branch in Syria were being inappropriately altered by senior officials, the Daily Beast reported.

The New York Times also reported that classified assessments about ISIS were significantly changed to “mask some of the American military’s failures in training Iraqi troops and beating back the Islamic State. The analysts say supervisors were particularly eager to paint a more optimistic picture of America’s role in the conflict than was warranted.”

And yet too many in the media sound downright Vox-y in their overall analysis of Obama’s foreign policy. This wasn’t even true when Matt Yglesias wrote it on November 16, but here’s how Vox Voxsplains Obama’s foreign policy:

Obama’s excellent record on national security

Consider, for example, the crowd-pleasing high points of Obama on national security. Unlike George W. Bush he really has “kept us safe” and avoided any terrorist attacks on the US homeland.

Even more wrong now than it was November 16.

And yet The Atlantic‘s James Fallows writes this week:

Obama: Chessmaster, not Pawn

Many of the president’s supporters fear that he hasn’t really known what he is doing. Many of his critics worry that he is all-too-skillful at attaining his ends. There’s increasing evidence that the critics may be right.

I think this may be the most obsequious subhead about Obama I’ve read yet: His supporters have a minor criticism that doesn’t dissuade them from supporting him! His critics think he’s a genius! The critics are right!

Even worse, this is the headline and subhead for an article claiming that Obama is totally awesome at foreign policy because of the mere existence of a climate deal; because of rapprochement with Cuba; and because of the Iran deal.

The media coverage of the cost of such wars has been eerily quiet, even though 75 percent of the soldiers killed in Afghanistan have been killed during Obama’s time in office.

Now, let’s assume he included Cuba because he needed at least three examples. And let’s acknowledge that there are people, such as Fallows, who earnestly believe the Iran deal is not a disaster. The climate deal? Are you kidding? I know it got journalists excited, but there was no risk of not getting a deal, particularly when it demanded so very little of the signers.

In any case, it’s 2015. We’re at war in Afghanistan, war in Iraq, helped destabilize Libya and Syria, have seen the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil since 9/11, have no ability to vet visitors and entrants to the country or otherwise protect our borders, and have no coherent strategy for dealing with ISIS. We have a president who actually claims that climate deals are a good way to fight ISIS, and a press that treats this as a reasonable claim to make.

Must be nice to be a Democratic president.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/12/15/were-all-being-pretty-quiet-about-obamas-failures-arent-we/,2015-12-15
Military Strategist Explains Why Trump Leads—And Will Fail,"No matter how much you dislike Donald Trump and his effect on the Republican presidential primary race—and there are many, many good reasons to do so—you have to spare a little grudging admiration for the sheer madcap genius of Trump’s ability to disrupt, unsettle, and exploit the primary system.

We can better understand what Trump has done successfully, as well as his ultimate limitations as a candidate and why he would be such a terrible president, using the ideas of military strategic theorist John Boyd. Trump has been, thus far, the true Boyd candidate in this race, yet he is already exhibiting symptoms of precisely the flaws that Boyd saw as fatal in combatants.

Observe, Orient, Decide, Act

Boyd, an Air Force fighter pilot, Vietnam and Korea veteran, and fighter design engineer, is best known for the “OODA Loop” or “decision cycle,” a concept he developed as part of a broader study of “patterns of conflict” in the 1970s and 1980s later widely adopted in the military, especially the U.S. Marine Corps. OODA stands for Observe-Orient-Decide-Act, and refers to the process by which soldiers in combat—or humans engaged in any form of conflict—absorb information, make decisions, and act on them. Boyd illustrated this with a graph:

Boyd’s theories were complex, constantly evolving, and never formally written down in one place in his lifetime—he preferred to play Socrates, and let others be Plato—so they are often oversimplified. But for present purposes, four generalizations will do.

First, operational tempo—speed—lies at the core of Boyd’s theory of conflict, and has been the most influential element of his thinking, both in the military and in how the concept of a “decision cycle” has seeped into our popular vocabulary. (Indeed, Boyd first made his name in the Air Force as “40-Second Boyd,” a fighter jock with a standing bet that he could get on any opponent’s tail in 40 seconds. Many took the bet; he never had to pay up.)

Boyd’s core insight was about the interactive and disruptive nature of speed on human decision-making: success in conflict can be rapid and dramatic if one can “operate inside the OODA Loop” of the opponent. Operating inside the opponent’s OODA Loop means presenting him with a constantly shifting battlefield that keeps him off-balance and disoriented so he is unable to process information and make and implement sound decisions before the situation changes again.

Put another way, you don’t just make better or faster decisions than your opponent, you can disrupt the opponent’s ability to make reality-based decisions if you can continuously change the reality before he has time to react to it.

If action flows nearly instantaneously from orientation, the quickness of the overall loop is accelerated. This relative acceleration will shorten, or seemingly compress the time an adversary has to reorient in response to what is happening in his environment. Boyd contended that in competitive situation, be it combat, sports or debate, the opponent with the relatively quicker loop will, at times, have a more relevant picture of the unfolding situation because he or she is shaping it rather than being forced to adapt to it. This mismatch in orientation can provide a fleeting opportunity for the quicker side to continue to act to exploit the effects of the first move, before the slower side understands what is happening. If the quicker side can maintain this mismatch, the slower side will become increasingly disconnected from the environment and their actions will become increasingly unrelated to the actual situation. They will be driven solely by perception. As this process continues, the relatively slower side continues to generate increasingly irrelevant observations, leading to more disconnected decisions, and so forth. The relatively slower side’s loop will fold back in on itself as confusion and disorder increase; generating an internally focused close loop.

Boyd referred to the concept of using your own actions to dictate what the enemy knows, and therefore does, as “implicit guidance.”

But Boyd did not stress speed for the sake of speed, in the form of simply acting faster than the opponent. Indeed, a successful Boydian approach will sometimes lead to the opponent increasing his tempo in a panic, thus leading to further breakdowns in his ability to make sound decisions on adequate information and implement them cohesively.

To use a football analogy, the point is to have a quarterback who can quickly read the field, be prepared to make a quick release upon spotting the best opportunity, and force the defense into a reactive mode due to the QB’s ability to quickly reshape the field—not a quarterback who heaves the ball downfield the instant he touches it without setting his feet and spotting an open man.

The Strategic Value of Ambiguity

Second, a crucial concept in Boyd’s work is ambiguity. An opponent who wishes to counter your approach will want to ascertain your intentions, capabilities, and movements, and respond accordingly. It becomes much more difficult to do this if you are able to keep your intentions and actions unclear to the opponent for as long as possible.

When combined with speed, ambiguity plays a crucial role in the OODA Loop in keeping the opponent from becoming oriented as a result of his observations.

Indeed, the ideal Boydian approach is to keep the opponent so confused he isn’t really sure who he’s fighting, where the battlefield begins or ends, or even if he’s in a fight at all! This is not a novel concept—it’s as old as Sun Tzu—but when combined with speed, ambiguity plays a crucial role in the OODA Loop in keeping the opponent from becoming oriented as a result of his observations.

One of the most devious and successful practitioners of ambiguity today is Vladimir Putin. From Ukraine to Georgia to Syria to the Baltics, Putin has shown again and again the ability to expand his influence while using secrecy, disinformation, and incrementalism to keep his potential opponents from becoming sufficiently oriented to make a decision and translate it into action.

While the West’s foreign policy apparatus continues to debate what exactly Putin wants, what he is doing, whether he is doing himself more harm than good, and even whether he is in some ways on our side, Putin is constantly reshaping the reality on the ground in ways that conform to his own ideas about his objectives.

Getting Enemies Into Their Unconscious Reflexes

Third, Boyd stressed that much of the OODA process occurs beyond conscious thought, and draws on things like reflex, training, memory, cultural background, and personal experience. This is most obvious in Boyd’s concept of orientation as a process that filters observations and tends to fit them into pre-existing “mental models” or frameworks of narrative and pattern recognition (in militaries, this tends to include a particular military’s doctrine).

Each combatant will orient around the same observations differently based on his own experience, heritage, and cluster of preconceptions.

The result is that each combatant will orient around the same observations differently based on his own experience, heritage, and cluster of preconceptions. It also stands out in the realm of action, especially action in physical forms of conflict like combat and sports. Because of the need for split-second decisions at the ground level, armies fight as they train, teams play as they practice.

For our purposes, the same thing can be true of political candidates on the trail. They are confronted with so many situations calling for them to address some new event, public policy argument, or cultural divide (in debates, interviews, town halls, fundraisers, and retail rope lines) that they could never possibly hope to respond to them all with thoughtful and considered original answers.

So they fall back on memorized texts (stump speeches, talking points, favorite anecdotes and jokes), their ideological instincts and party platforms, and things that have worked for them in the past. When cornered, they may retreat to their happy place—war record, humble origins story, defeat of a despised foe, talent for baiting hecklers or the media, agitation of economic or racial resentments, whatever has gotten them out of jams in the past.

When Participants Don’t Evolve to Fit Reality

Fourth, all of Boyd’s theories center around dynamic systems, i.e., systems in which all the elements affect all the others continuously, and change is constant. The OODA Loop itself is a dynamic rather than linear process, as the many circle-back lines on Boyd’s chart illustrate.

The OODA Loop itself is a dynamic rather than linear process.

For example, the combatant may affect the situation merely by observing it, and decision is merely a hypothesis that will be tested and refined based on how additional observations are collected and how the decision-maker becomes oriented around them. The ability of each combatant to affect the other’s OODA Loop is, of course, key to the idea of getting inside the other’s Loop and using implicit guidance to collapse his ability to make sound or reality-based decisions.

More broadly, Boyd stressed the difference between open and closed systems of conflict and the need for open systems of O-O-D-A to deal with the former (which are the norm in human conflict).

Consider a simple video game like Pac-Man: the game operates according to programmed rules and will function in a predictable way, so the more times you play, the more you learn to process the feedback the game gives you and turn it into actions that improve your chances of winning. The game is a closed system, and a veteran player can beat it with a closed system of observing, orienting, deciding, and acting, fitting each new observation into a set of preconceptions about how the game’s rules and winning strategies operate.

But most forms of human conflict are open systems—the rules and conditions are not only constantly changing, but also reacting continuously to how you approach them. The opponent may be trying to get inside your OODA Loop; the terrain on which the conflict rages may be expanding or contracting; the available tools and technologies and cultural presuppositions may be evolving; new combatants may be entering or leaving the fray. Because the conditions are an open system, the OODA process must also be open and evolving, rather than falling back on the kind of fixed expectations that come rationally with repeating conflict in a closed system like playing Pac-Man:

Incestuous amplification occurs when one’s preconceptions misshape the observations that one is sensing. These misshapen observations then blur the true connection between the individual and the environment because the brain begins to synthesize cues and preconceived responses. Viewed abstractly, incestuous amplification hijacks the orientation of an individual’s OODA loop by overriding actual observations to a point where the subsequent orientation induces the individual to perceive and act on what he or she wants to see rather than what actually is. First order effects of this disconnect may be initially too small to measure thanks in part to luck, chance, or ambiguity. However, if the cycle continues unabated, subsequent actions continue to induce dysfunctional behavior back into the entire OODA loop, which then folds back on itself to magnify the mismatch…the effect…is a little like placing a microphone next a speaker when recording, only much more dangerous….This kind of positive feedback loop essentially forms a closed system. Left uncorrected, the individual exhibiting an incestuously amplifying OODA loop becomes increasingly disconnected from his or her environment…Incestuous amplification has the effect of closing off the system from its environment…without a correction or change that opens the decider’s OODA loop to an effective communication with the real world, the only uncertainty in the outcome is how long an OODA loop driven mad by incestuous amplification can last before it degenerates into chaos, confusion, and disorder.

Chaos, confusion and disorder sounds like a lot of what we have seen thus far in the Republican primaries.

June 2015: Enter Trump

So, what does this all have to do with Donald Trump? Quite a lot. Few candidates in recent political memory have been so effective at altering the reality around them in a way that crashes their opponents’ OODA Loops.

Ambiguity: Freezing The Opposition

Let’s start with ambiguity. Trump has been flirting with electoral politics so long, he was asked in an interview with Rona Barrett in 1980 about his possible interest in running for president someday, and Larry King asked him at the 1988 GOP convention if he would have accepted an invitation to be George H.W. Bush’s running mate. He joined H. Ross Perot’s “Reform Party” in 1999 and even ran briefly in its primaries for the 2000 election before bowing out and watching the nomination go to Pat Buchanan.

Unable to discern Trump’s intentions in May, June, and July, his opponents were tentative in reaching decisions and putting them into action.

Trump zigged—he declared that he identified as a Democrat as recently as 2004, donated significant sums of money to Hillary Clinton and other Democrats despised by rank-and-file Republicans, and had glowing words for Hillary and President Obama. He zagged—he confronted Obama so directly over his birthplace in 2011 that Obama felt compelled to finally publicly release his Hawaiian birth certificate, and he endorsed Mitt Romney in the 2012 primaries, saying that if Romney were the nominee, Trump would not stage his own third-party bid in 2012.

Given his long and erratic history, loose party loyalty, and propensity to bluff, Trump’s competitors for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination were quite reasonably conditioned to view talk of a Trump 2016 campaign, and even his June 16 announcement, with uncertainty: was it another publicity stunt? A run-up to a Perot-style third party campaign? A stalking horse for some hidden agenda? A personal vendetta against Jeb Bush? Or a real effort to win the Republican nomination?

Unable to discern Trump’s intentions in May, June, and July, his opponents were tentative in reaching decisions and putting them into action. To the extent that he maintains the third-party threat to this day, it provides him a screen of ambiguity that protects him against attacks other candidates would have to face. Nobody worries that Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio or Jeb Bush will leave the party in a snit and launch a third-party bid; Trump’s credible threat of doing so makes primary opponents think twice about attacking him in ways they would not hesitate to attack loyal Republicans whose intent to abide by primary outcomes is clear.

Subconscious Orientation: The Giant Sucking Sound

As Boyd would predict, personal history formed the mental models that figured into the candidates’ assessments of the third-party threat. For Jeb Bush, 1992 had to loom large: a populist billionaire fond of ranting against trade with Mexico barges into the race as a third-party candidate, splitting off the Buchananist chunk of the GOP base and handing a national election from the Bush family to the Clinton family.

Jeb was conditioned to fear a Trump third-party run as a larger threat than a Trump run as a Republican.

So, from the outset, Jeb was conditioned to fear a Trump third-party run as a larger threat than a Trump run as a Republican. In the early going, therefore, Jeb’s natural orientation was to back away from conflict that might further antagonize Trump.

Three GOP contenders—Marco Rubio, Rick Perry, and Chris Christie—had a different history. All three had faced down third-party challenges and won: Christie knocked off a sitting Democratic governor despite a third-party challenge from the Right (who was suspected of being a stalking horse for the Democrats), Rubio beat a sitting Republican governor for a Senate seat in the primary and beat him again when he ran third-party; and Perry won his second re-election in a wild four-way affair with two independents, one of them celebrity author Kinky Friedman. Perry had also survived a moderate primary challenge in 2010, but in 2012 he lost to the establishment favorite, Mitt Romney, in part because Perry was blindsided by attacks from his right (mainly by Michele Bachmann) on immigration.

It was therefore Perry—predictably, in hindsight—who disregarded Trump’s shield of ambiguity, seeing him as a threat to be neutralized no matter what he was up to, and moved first against Trump in August. Perry challenged Trump directly on immigration and hoped to use the confrontation to shore up his own credentials on the issue. The Texas gunslinger would find himself walking into a fatal trap.

Dynamic Systems: Toto, It’s Not 2012 Anymore

Perry, himself a former Air Force transport pilot, correctly assessed his adversary’s intentions, but not the way the terrain had shifted from 2012 and how his opponent was reshaping it to his advantage.

A key weapon in 2012 was Romney’s SuperPAC, which delivered barrages of negative advertising concentrated against whichever rival threatened him most at any one time.

The central dynamic of 2012 was a fairly conventional one for a Republican primary: a lavishly funded establishment front-runner trying to keep conservative and anti-establishment sentiment divided among an assortment of insurgents (and one more-moderate-than-thou gadfly) rather than unified behind a credible head-to-head opponent.

A key weapon in 2012 was Romney’s SuperPAC, which delivered barrages of negative advertising concentrated against whichever rival threatened him most at any one time. Insurgents like Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum also used SuperPACs to funnel a single wealthy supporter’s donations into enough TV oxygen to stay on the air despite a narrow donor base.

But the 2016 terrain is different in a number of significant ways. Four involve the structural dynamics of the field.

First, with 17 candidates who could be described as at least vaguely serious—including eight multi-term governors and five multi-term or sitting senators—and no initially dominant frontrunner, the field was inevitably going to involve a Hobbesian scramble for resources, attention, and support.

The field was inevitably going to involve a Hobbesian scramble for resources, attention, and support.

Second, the importance of SuperPACs in 2012 concealed their limitations: they can be used for offensive or defensive TV advertising, but not to keep a candidate’s own staff and organization in the field.

Third, the debate system had been overhauled to limit the number of debates (making them bigger media events) and put poll-driven strictures on who could be on the main stage, which interacted with the size of the field to mean that many real candidates would not even make it to the main debate, and that low early poll standing could become a self-fulfilling prophecy, thus accelerating the tempo needed to survive.

Fourth, the primary season has been compressed—voting starts a month later but ends at the same time, while the convention is a month earlier—so there will be comparatively little time to raise money and build infrastructure after Iowa and New Hampshire, putting a premium on early hiring and spending, which in turn means high “burn rates” for candidates organizing along traditional lines.

Free Media For the Win

Trump seems to have shrewdly assessed both the terrain and his own capabilities and realized that the crowded nature of the field meant that the most valuable of all resources in this context was the one he was most accustomed to commanding: free media. Trump accumulated a massive advantage in press coverage over the summer, especially on cable news, with networks often covering his speeches in their entirety.

Political scientists have noted the correlation between media coverage and polling, especially early in a primary campaign.

One emblematic late August analysis found CNN giving Trump 78 percent of its GOP campaign coverage. He’s still at it: an analysis of news in the days following his proposal earlier this month to ban Muslim immigration found Trump getting 25 times as many media mentions as the other 13 Republican candidates combined.

Political scientists have noted the correlation between media coverage and polling, especially early in a primary campaign, and this was bound to have an even larger impact when such a large field meant voters knew comparatively little about the various contenders. Trump, of course, has (like Romney) the deterrent effect of a potentially large self-funded war chest at the ready, but he has never needed to spend it. He’s spent only $217,000 on campaign ads, compared to $28.9 million by Jeb and between $2 million and $11 million by each of Rubio, Christie, John Kasich, and Ben Carson. No candidate in recent memory has exploited such an opportunity, and Trump’s ability to do so has altered the battlefield.

Taken in combination, these factors conspired—upon Trump’s dive into the deep end of the pool and initial poll surge—to put immediate stress on all the other campaigns’ ability to balance their need for long-term organizational spending with their fundraising capabilities (which can be limited when a candidate is polling in single digits in a crowded field) and their need to pay for the kind of publicity Trump could command for free.

Trump has the deterrent effect of a potentially large self-funded war chest at the ready, but he has never needed to spend it.

Perry and Scott Walker were the first victims of this. Unlike leanly staffed campaigns designed for a candidate who is running to build name recognition or send a message, Perry and especially Walker were running to win, and had spent accordingly.

But the early polls kept Perry off the main debate stage, hampering his fundraising. The long game he played successfully in Texas in 2006 and 2010 wouldn’t work. He needed a successful confrontation with Trump. While his move to denounce Trump’s ham-fisted immigration rhetoric was brave and principled, it meant going up against Trump when he was at the peak of his media saturation.

2016 Is Vastly Different From 2012

It wasn’t just timing, however. Four other factors had changed on Perry, and Trump exploited all of them. Three were in the mood of the voters themselves.

The manner of Romney’s loss and the paucity of policy accomplishments from the congressional GOP exacerbated anti-establishment sentiment in the GOP primary electorate.

One, the manner of Romney’s loss and the paucity of policy accomplishments from the congressional GOP exacerbated anti-establishment sentiment in the GOP primary electorate, spreading to a general distrust of the whole system and everyone in it.

Two, President Obama’s unilateral executive actions on immigration, and the sensational killing of Kate Steinle by an illegal immigrant on July 1, dialed up the intensity of the immigration issue, which had never been a decisive factor in GOP primaries before 2012.

Three, as best symbolized by the shockingly rapid progress since 2012 of the same-sex marriage political movement, the standards of public mores and public discourse have been changing in ways and at a pace that is disorienting to a lot of older, more traditional voters (even voters who may not themselves be especially religious or socially conservative).

As a result, a chunk of the electorate (at least, people polled as being GOP voters) was not in a mood for the kind of grown-up leadership that traditional Republican nominees like Romney, McCain, Dole, the Bushes, and Reagan embodied. Instead, they responded positively when Trump was deliberately outrageous, repeatedly saying things that weren’t “politically correct.”

The standards of public mores and public discourse have been changing in ways and at a pace that is disorienting to a lot of older, more traditional voters.

So when asked to choose between Trump (who had catered to this type of audience with a similar style in his years of association with pro wrestling and who now barged onto the scene calling Mexicans rapists) and Perry (who had won six statewide elections in Texas by carefully balancing toughness on the border with a welcoming approach to Texas Hispanics), many were willing to choose confrontational rhetoric over experience.

Of course, that Buchananite strain has always existed in the party, and insurgencies like Bachmann’s had failed in the recent past. But for Perry, the financial and structural realities of the new battlefield meant that he was squeezed out before the fight could go on for long.

The Media Is As Desperate as Base Voters

The fourth factor was the media itself, and its susceptibility to being bribed or bullied—not with cash, but with the currency of Trump’s talent for spectacle. Cable TV news networks are facing a downward trend in ratings. They’re not the only ones under stress—talk radio has also been facing declining ratings and advertising rates, in part due to assaults from left-wing social-media campaigns against its advertisers.

Cable TV news networks are facing a downward trend in ratings. They’re not the only ones under stress.

Enter Trump, whose theatrical antics are ratings gold and who is not shy about throwing around the clout that gives him. He has repeatedly used the high ratings generated by his appearances to jawbone the cable news networks over debate formats, including the unprecedented step of negotiating the CNBC debate down to two hours, and it seems unlikely he’d be above using similar tactics against talk radio hosts.

In years past, right-leaning talk radio had treated favorably many of the people running, and many of the leading conservative talkers were people with movement conservative backgrounds who understood well the principles Trump treats as fungible. Yet, right-wing talk radio has—with a few honorable exceptions—rallied around Trump, basking in the audience-driving controversy he brings with him. When the circus comes to town, everyone wants to be a clown.

Trump’s ability to spot the media’s pressure points and leverage them to his advantage gave him a decisive edge over Perry and other opponents in the summer. But a different aspect of Trump’s modus operandi would help him scuttle his next target—the no. 2 candidate in the race—and humble the presumptive frontrunner: the tempo of his assaults on their OODA Loops.

Tempo: Culling the Slow From the Front of the Herd

After Perry, the second candidate to drop would be Walker, one of the early favorites for the nomination. For the first half of 2015, Jeb and Walker sat first and second in the national polls, with Walker leading in Iowa and Jeb in New Hampshire.

Trump’s operational tempo left Jeb and Walker disoriented and constantly unable to craft workable responses.

By Labor Day, Jeb was in single digits nationally and in the first two states, and Walker was out of money, dropping out of the race shortly thereafter. Trump was not the only reason both campaigns crashed and burned in six weeks, but he was the proximate cause that sent both spiraling to the ground, brutally exposing the latent weaknesses in their OODA Loops.

A major reason Trump was able to outflank Walker and Jeb was speed. His operational tempo left them disoriented and constantly unable to craft workable responses that kept up with how quickly Trump was reshaping reality around them.

Traditional political campaigns, no matter how savvy and quick-witted the candidate may be, rely on layers of political consultants, policy advisers, and pollsters before making important decisions about their message. There are completely rational reasons for this. Very few elections are won by a single message or candidate statement, but a great many are lost by a single one. Messages are the coin of the realm of politics, but the risk/reward calculus of each individual message requires careful strategic deliberation. And deliberation takes time.

Insurgent campaigns that lack this level of risk-aversion can rise with astonishing speed because they can create new and distinctive messages at a rapid pace without the usual deliberation, but they can also implode suddenly and spectacularly, and political pros are conditioned to wait them out and hope they do. That gives insurgents a window of opportunity to launch damaging attacks. But no insurgent in a national election in recent memory has moved as quickly as Trump, or lasted long enough to destroy so many other serious contenders as they tried to wait him out.

Trump’s Unity Isn’t Ideas, But Himself

Trump’s fling-it-all-at-the-wall tempo of attacks and messages is unique. It starts with the fact that essentially everything that comes from the Trump campaign comes from Trump himself – his rambling, stream-of-consciousness speeches, his interviews, his tweets that he clearly writes himself in his distinctive style.

Trump’s basic style is ‘BS,’ in which he is interested neither in the truth nor in lying to his audience, but just in riffing on a theme without much connection to the facts.

This gives Trump’s message approach a remarkable thematic and stylistic cohesion at any tempo (despite its underlying incoherence in terms of facts or principles, neither of which concern him). It extends to the fact that—bluntly speaking—Trump’s basic style is “BS,” in which he is interested neither in the truth nor in lying to his audience, but just in riffing on a theme without much connection to the facts and certainly without bothering to fact-check anything he says before he says it. Trump has repeatedly shown his willingness, to a degree unprecedented in politics, to heave personal insults at his opponents, mocking their appearance and their poll standing with put-downs.

These are all approaches Trump has been using for years and years. He didn’t improvise them from study of the battlespace, but just went with what he already knew how to do. But he was also able to gain unusually rapid traction because—unlike the typical insurgent—he had already been nationally famous for three decades and a fixture on network television.

(As we shall see throughout this review of Trump’s M.O. while he has executed some shrewd maneuvers, his success thus far says more about his ability to exploit his adversaries’ OODA Loops than having a particular mastery of his own.)

Inverting the Campaign Rules about Messaging

Moreover, there are time-tested rules for messaging that any campaign veteran knows: if an attack is winning, you stick with it as long as it keeps delivering dividends; if you’re talking about something that’s hurting you, the best approach is to cut your losses and move on to something else.

Experienced politicians are conditioned to see sticking with a message as a sign that it’s working and abandoning a message as a sign that it’s failing.

Trump regularly inverts this rule, as well, which is again disorienting for experienced politicians who are conditioned to see sticking with a message as a sign that it’s working and abandoning a message as a sign that it’s failing. If Trump taunts his opponent and feels like he’s drawing blood, he bores in with a rapidly shifting series of attacks.

By the time a campaign like Jeb’s can work out a response, Trump has moved on and is hitting him from a different angle, then another, then another. At least over the short term, this follows Boyd’s stress on a varied approach that keeps the opponent constantly off-balance.

On the other hand, when Trump shoots off his mouth and seems to get himself into a lot of trouble, he may backtrack slightly or deny what he meant, but invariably he will dig in and keep talking about it, using stray voltage to bait his critics into giving him more free media attention (the scarce and valuable commodity he has hoarded).

This showcases Trump’s willingness to be outrageous and his refusal to back down—essential parts of his brand. Again, the mismatch between how Trump reacts and how experienced politicians are conditioned to expect their opponents to react confounds their ability to process what he’s doing.

Jeb and Walker Mismanage Time and Space

Why were Jeb and Walker hit so disproportionately hard by this? Partly because they were in front and had the most to lose, partly because they had the largest staffs and therefore potentially the slowest-moving campaigns, and partly due to their personal temperaments. But also because of time and space.

Jeb ran his last campaign in 2002, and the issue environment and political mood had changed a lot since.

In Jeb’s case, time: he ran his last campaign in 2002, and the issue environment and political mood had changed a lot since 2012, let alone a decade earlier. Unlike Trump, he hadn’t spent the past several years in the center of the public eye. He has repeatedly proven slow to adapt his mental models to the current reality, as well as slow to adapt to fluid situations.

His disastrous confrontation with Rubio over missed votes (at the third debate) was a textbook example of letting an opponent inside your OODA Loop. Jeb built on a newspaper attack, which had allowed Rubio adequate time to prepare a response. He then launched it at an inopportune time—as Jonathan Last wrote at the time:

Bush’s attack was almost certainly a pre-meditated set piece. Yet he didn’t have the political sense to see that Rubio was in a very good frame coming off of an answer where he beat the snot out of the moderators. Bush had no ability to read the scene and understand that it would have been better in that moment not to take the shot. He had a plan, so he robotically stuck to it.

Finally, unlike Rubio, Jeb never saw coming the trap he was walking into, which should have been obvious to anyone with basic situational awareness, when Rubio asked the classic lawyer’s leading question about how Jeb had supported John McCain when he was making his late-2007 comeback. That allowed Rubio to drop the “but McCain missed more votes than I did” crusher that left Jeb too deflated to respond.

Most of Jeb’s failures to read the scene and react faster have happened offstage (although this is hardly the only example from the debates). His slow reaction times contributed mightily to his failure to adjust and formulate an effective response to the Trump barrage over the summer.

Walker’s problem was one of space. Walker had been in elective office for 25 years, and had faced the voters of Wisconsin three times in the past five years, most recently November 2014, so he was much fresher from the fight than Jeb. But the depth of his local experience turned into a liability. Boyd was fond of citing four interlocking concepts favored by the German military:

Fingerspitzengefühl, which translates more or less as fingertips-feel, a commander’ s ability to hold in his mind a map of the whole battlefield, not just its fixed terrain but its fluid, shifting movement of forces; Auftragstaktik, the ability to give orders at a fairly high level of generality and have them carried out faithfully by subordinates focused on the objective, rather than direction by micromanagement; Einheit, an animating unity of purpose that keeps the whole organization focused not only on a single goal but on a common way of doing things (the more einheit an organization has, the more it can trust in management by auftragstaktik); and Schwerpunkt, or the point of decision—the crucial concept of focusing on the opponent’s point of maximum vulnerability (or in some cases, the maximum point of resistance that needs to be defeated) and concentrating as much of one’s forces and efforts on that particular target as possible at once.

Walker’s long and remarkable success in Wisconsin, including victories in Democratic-leaning Milwaukee County and statewide wins in a Democratic-leaning state, derived in large part from his mastery of fingerspitzengefühl. Walker’s natural voter base in Wisconsin was economically or educationally downscale white voters, like blue-collar workers and voters with no college degrees, who saw him as one of their own, an “aggressively normal” beer-and-brats Harley rider, Midwestern to his core, who never finished college after leaving to take a job, married a widow 12 years his senior, and was fond of using his Instagram feed to display his brown-bag ham-and-cheese lunches.

Walker almost literally knows the political geography of the Milwaukee and Wisconsin general electorates like the back of his hand.

Walker almost literally knows the political geography of the Milwaukee and Wisconsin general electorates like the back of his hand (but not so much Republican primary electorates, having dropped out early from the 2006 gubernatorial primary and backed his opponent, clearing the field for his own mostly uncontested 2010 nomination). He has long been his own chief strategist, notorious for a near-obsessive attention to the details of his message and strategy. He’s the guy who knows the terrain better than the experts.

Given this background, Walker did not hire a national strategist for his otherwise heavily staffed campaign, preferring to retain personal control over strategy. In a vastly larger campaign than his usual statewide operations, that raised concerns early on about micromanagement, which of course could slow down the speed of the rest of his campaign, the opposite of an organization run on principles of auftragstaktik.

It was worse than that: the very local mastery at the center of Walker’s mental models is impossible at the scale of a national campaign, like Eisenhower trying to oversee the whole European theater on horseback. Even before Trump’s entry in the race, Walker had stumbled several times by reversing course on issues and aspects of his message as he struggled to figure out what would resonate with the national and early-state electorates.

Trump swiftly cannibalized Walker’s targeted voter base, even though he was a candidate far removed from ‘one of us.’

Time also became a factor. Walker had counted on having time in the summer and early fall to work out the kinks of his message, get his rookie mistakes out of the way, and prepare for the progressively more serious stages of the campaign to follow.

Instead, Trump swiftly cannibalized Walker’s targeted voter base, even though he was a candidate far removed from “one of us”: a New York City billionaire who was born to wealth, loves to brag about his Wharton School degree, and is on his third wife, a Yugoslavian-born fashion model. Yet Trump’s un-P.C. way of talking resonated far more with the shifts in national Republican voter sentiment than Walker’s low-key, nice-guy Wisconsin general election persona.

The Washington Post, writing at the end of August, described a combatant whose opponent was well inside his OODA Loop:

Walker’s backers see a campaign discombobulated by Trump’s booming popularity and by his provocative language on immigration, China and other issues. They see in Walker a candidate who — in contrast to the discipline he showed in state races — continues to commit unforced errors, either out of lack of preparation or in an attempt to grab for part of the flamboyant businessman’s following.

When Walker ran short on resources, he did what his 2006 experience and its aftermath had conditioned him to do: cut his losses and drop out long before the voting.

Trump Photobombs the Republican Field

With Walker and Perry sunk at sea and Jeb driven on the shoals, the remaining field mostly divided into three groups: candidates nimble enough to keep up with how Trump was shifting the landscape, and reorient themselves accordingly (such as Cruz and Rubio); candidates who were never really competing for voters who might listen to Trump (mainly Kasich), and candidates far enough removed from the central theaters of operations that they could stick safely to their original plans or make adjustments that had no effect on the race anyway.

Jindal sometimes ruefully joked that he should drop Trump’s name at random intervals in his speeches just to get media coverage.

But some were also adversely affected by Trump’s alteration of reality around them. For example, Bobby Jindal—a major victim of how Trump sucked the free-media oxygen from the field, drove the debate away from non-immigration domestic policy proposals, and made less room for dark horse candidates on the main debate stage—ran short of money and dropped out in November rather than run up a bunch of campaign debt. Jindal sometimes ruefully joked that he should drop Trump’s name at random intervals in his speeches just to get media coverage.

Rand Paul had hoped to inherit his father’s oddly constructed coalition (consisting of principled libertarians, national security doves, and racist, neo-Confederate, or conspiracy-minded cranks) and expand it by being more moderate, more charismatic, and less odd than his father.

That strategy had already been unraveling for some months before Trump’s arrival, but the third and least savory segment of the old Ron Paul movement seems to have decamped more or less en masse to Trump, as it turned out that they were never really in it for the libertarian principles but for the newsletter crackpottery that always embarrassed Paul’s more thoughtful supporters and sympathizers.

Paul seemed on the verge of dropping out until he reoriented his campaign away from pursuing victory towards giving voice to the principled remnant of his movement.

Paul seemed on the verge of dropping out until he reoriented his campaign away from pursuing victory towards giving voice to the principled remnant of his movement, the segment that was always least attracted to Trump. It remains to be seen how long Paul will stay in the race, having unsubtly threatened to quit if he didn’t make the main stage for the December 15 debate in Las Vegas.

Chris Christie, already known for being blunt and loud, has gotten progressively blunter and louder, and is now picking up enough in the New Hampshire polls that he is headed towards an inevitable collision with Trump.

The Closed Loop: The Doctor Is Not Listening

Before you can use speed to disorient your opponent and induce panic decisions, the opponent must first notice what you are doing. An opponent who is deceived by ambiguity or simply oblivious to his surroundings must simply be made to await the consequences of reality intruding on him.

An opponent who is deceived by ambiguity must simply be made to await the consequences of reality intruding on him.

Ironically, the 2016 contender whose rise concurrent with Trump in the early fall was not affected at all by Trump was Ben Carson. One reason for this is that Carson himself was not only running a highly unconventional campaign, to all appearances he operates in such a closed informational loop that he simply doesn’t process news from outside his favored sources at all. Trump could change the reality on the ground all he wanted, but Carson was going to keep doing his own thing because doing his own thing is what he does.

In time, this has caught up to him. Carson has faded in the polls as voters see his missteps and unpreparedness on major issues, mostly independently of Trump. But Carson’s fall holds lessons for Trump as well, as we shall see. A candidate who ignores any information that doesn’t fit his implicit orientation can avoid distraction, but will sooner or later find to his peril that he is relying on feedback that has lost touch with the reality he is trying to affect.

2008: The Last Bombing Run

We’ve discussed thus far the basics of the OODA Loop and how Trump has exploited it. But before we get to where the Loop may begin to bend against him (or some of his adversaries), we need to consider the concept of a subsidiary or dependent loop. That is, a theater of operations that a combatant swoops in and dominates, only to later discover to his grief that he has drawn his attention away from the main battlefield.

We have another recent example of a national campaign that grasped the outlines of the OODA Loop but still got disoriented and lost the main battlefield.

One example of this was the 2012 Iowa Straw Poll, in which Michele Bachmann successfully drew Tim Pawlenty into a contest of strength that drained Pawlenty’s funds and forced him out of the race when he lost to his fellow Minnesotan. But it turned out that Bachmann hadn’t actually won anything. She was shortly eclipsed by Herman Cain in the polls, and ended up finishing dead last in the Iowa Caucus.

We have another recent example of a national campaign that grasped the outlines of the OODA Loop but still got disoriented and lost the main battlefield: the last general election campaign by a combat pilot, John McCain in 2008.

McCain, nine years younger than Boyd and a carrier-based Navy bomber pilot in Vietnam, started his race against Barack Obama in a polling and organizational hole, but with the advantage that he was able to lock up his party’s nomination a lot earlier than Obama. McCain had survived that far by making his team leaner, jettisoning most of his old campaign advisers before staging a big primary comeback. That fit with the “maverick” senator’s preferred approach and temperament—as the old line goes, it’s no accident that McCain in the Navy always flew a one-seater airplane.

McCain had a few built-in advantages over Obama: he was not just vastly more experienced on the national political stage, a fixture on the Sunday shows with a prior presidential run under his belt, but (unlike Obama’s primary foe, Hillary Clinton), McCain had long, friendly relations with much of the national press corps. Despite his more advanced age, McCain was faster, nimbler on his feet, and much quicker to change course than Obama.

Fighting Inside the 24-Hour News Cycle

1992 was the first election after the Gulf War had launched cable news to national prominence and the end of the Fairness Doctrine unleashed national talk radio; 2004 was the first with blogs but the last before the real spread of Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. A central battlefield of national campaigns in the years from 1992 to 2004 was the news cycle—the collection of stories that would dominate a few days’ coverage and talk.

Where 1980s campaigns had aimed for the good photo-op and soundbite for the evening news, 1990s-2000s campaigns aimed to control the round-the-clock news cycle.

Where 1980s campaigns had aimed for the good photo-op and soundbite for the evening news, 1990s-2000s campaigns aimed to control the round-the-clock news cycle. If you control the news cycle, you set the ground of what the campaigns are talking about. Winning campaigns like the Clinton “War Room” of 1992 mastered this; losing ones like Al Gore in 2000 were constantly reactive to the news cycle, and pushed off-message.

It’s easily forgotten now given how the campaign ended, but once battle was joined, McCain and his campaign manager Steve Schmidt tactically outfoxed Obama for much of summer 2008, winning news cycle after news cycle with attacks and ads needling Obama’s foreign trip, his celebrity status, and his self-importance. McCain was moving faster than Obama, and getting inside his head by pricking his vanity.

Then, he staged the tactically brilliant coup of picking Sarah Palin as his running mate. How tactically brilliant? Operational security was airtight. The media was totally in the dark that Palin was on her way until she arrived to be announced that morning. The Democrats were flabbergasted—they’d posted a website with advance opposition research on McCain’s potential running mates (including people like Eric Cantor, Charlie Crist, and FedEx CEO Fred Smith) but it didn’t include a word on Palin. Palin completely dominated the news cycle for a solid week after the GOP convention, and national polls showed McCain pulling even with Obama.

But even before the tactical audacity of the Palin pick started to get undermined by Palin’s own issues, McCain and Schmidt had totally lost sight of the larger picture McCain needed to win the election. McCain’s news-cycle victories were flawed in two ways.

But Social Media Had Overtaken the News Cycle

First, he was reinforcing things voters already priced into Obama (that he was inexperienced, overpromising, and full of himself) instead of defining Obama as having values out of step with the electorate. Second, while McCain was needling Obama, Obama’s digital organizing team was focused on the more critically important battlefield of identifying potential supporters and building direct communications with them, using the one-to-one targeting capabilities of social media to bypass the mass media news cycle in ways impossible as recently as 2004.

While McCain was needling Obama, Obama’s digital organizing team was focused on the more critically important battlefield.

Thus, McCain was able to outfox Obama’s rapid response to news in a way that unsettled Obama and his communications team, but he wasn’t able to throw off the Obama campaign’s overarching strategy. McCain had flown his bomber into a subsidiary loop.

This made him vulnerable to being swamped by a new, external event: the September 2008 credit crisis. When it hit, he reacted again with speed and surprise, announcing a brief suspension of his campaign to fly back to DC to help handle the crisis. But McCain’s capacity to surprise no longer mattered. Obama and his team had, correctly, interpreted the crisis as a help to them and any solution as unpopular. They let McCain fly off into the sun.

Collapsing Trump’s Loop

If Trump has been so effective at strategy thus far in the campaign, does that mean he would be a successful general election candidate and a good commander-in-chief? No, it doesn’t, and in fact, there are significant warning signs that Trump may already be falling into some of the very traps Boyd warned against.

There are significant warning signs that Trump may already be falling into some of the very traps Boyd warned against.

In some ways, Trump’s situation in the summer and fall of 2015 is similar to that of Imperial Japan in late 1941 and early 1942. The Japanese ran wild for six months after Pearl Harbor, using speed, strategic and tactical surprise, and sudden, overwhelming force to disorient their opponents and change their surrounding reality faster than they could react.

They also compelled their adversaries—in the short run—to fight the kind of war the Japanese had spent the previous 36 years planning for. The result took the weakest combatant (the Dutch) completely out of the fight, drove most distant and thus slowest to replenish its forces (the British Navy) out of the theater, and sent the locals underground (the Filipinos) or deeper into their interior (the Chinese).

But the Japanese didn’t apply Boyd’s OODA cycle as an open loop from which they could learn and adapt. They just came in with a cast-in-stone pre-existing skillset that was spectacularly well-suited to their initial offensive. They operated inside the enemy’s Loop, but without tending to their own, which remained mostly closed.

What Japan was not prepared for, or able to handle when it inevitably developed, was the expansion of the battlefield that was necessary to actually win the war. From mid-1942 on, the Americans launched 16 new warships for every one Japan produced the rest of the war.

They operated inside the enemy’s Loop, but without tending to their own, which remained mostly closed.

Japan had expanded to its maximum limits. It could not win another inch of territory, and bled its navy white at Midway and its army dry in Burma, having exhausted the low-hanging fruit while the enemy’s available ground troops were multiplying. A war spanning the whole of the Pacific, China, Southeast Asia, and all the islands in between was far beyond Japan’s manpower capacity, and Japanese high command was slow to learn and adapt to a new and different war than the one they had started.

Trump has been winning by forcing the other contenders to the battlefields on which he has been training the past 35 years: mass-market free publicity, pro-wrestling-style smash-mouth reality TV, and collective-action negotiations of the type Trump knows well from multiple real-estate bankruptcies.

But, like Imperial Japan, this does not mean he’s an evolving combatant who can handle opponents shifting the battlefield and upsetting his ability to process reality. It just means that he has seized the initiative and planted his flag on all the territory his initial surge could reach by using the same approach he’s been honing for decades. He is just as much a creature of his own experience-based mental models as Jeb or Walker. The only difference is that his entry in the race was so unplanned that his opponents had to watch him in action before they could plot a counter-strategy.

The Gold-Plated Closed Loop

Winston Churchill once described the essential attributes of a great commander as having “massive common sense and reasoning power, not only imagination, but also an element of legerdemain, an original and sinister touch, which leaves the enemy puzzled as well as beaten.” Trump may have the legerdemain, but he sorely lacks the rest.

While he’s very shrewd and swift in observing, orienting, deciding, and acting when he’s on familiar terrain, Trump draws information from a fairly closed loop.

The signs we have seen so far of Trump suggest that, while he’s very shrewd and swift in observing, orienting, deciding, and acting when he’s on familiar terrain, he draws information from a fairly closed loop, and is not well-suited to expanding to a broader, less familiar battlefield. Therein lies his vulnerability in a primary or general election, as well as his deficiency as a potential commander-in-chief despite his natural grasp of the basic precepts of strategy, tactics, leverage, speed, and ambiguity.

The way Trump has dealt with facts in his public statements is a tipoff. Political speech routinely incorporates assertions of fact that range from debatable to unverifiable to provably false, and sometimes this is a sign of shrewd cynicism rather than self-deception.

But Trump has repeatedly made statements that he and his team had clearly made no effort to verify in advance, drawn from sources whose credibility should have been huge red flags, even though they were outside the common cultural and media conventional wisdom and therefore likely to be challenged.

In political debate, that represents a vulnerability waiting to be exploited; in international affairs, where presidents must routinely cut through misinformation and direct their staffs to do the same, it can be fatal.

Trump has repeatedly made statements that he and his team had clearly made no effort to verify in advance, drawn from sources whose credibility should have been huge red flags.

The recent dustup over Trump’s claim—which was, at best, severely exaggerated—that he had seen video of thousands of Muslims celebrating 9/11 in Jersey City is a classic example of this. So is the fact that Trump cites Infowars reporting in campaign speeches based solely on having clicked a link on the Drudge Report, and has gone on Alex Jones’ conspiracy-theory-soaked show to trade praise with Jones.

Trump’s willingness to pitch public battles on the turf of things he reads on the Internet without even remotely credible confirmation suggests that—despite his savvy in evaluating information when dealing with the U.S. national media environment and the economic bargaining tables he’s excelled at—Trump is vulnerable to psyop disinformation campaigns once he gets outside his comfort zone.

As “Black Hawk Down” author Mark Bowden summarized his impression of Trump from spending a weekend with him in 1996 for a Playboy magazine profile:

Time after time the stories he told me didn’t check out…Apart from the comical ego, the errors, and the self-serving bluster, what you get from Trump are commonplace ideas pronounced as received wisdom…The ideas that pop into his head are the same ones that occur to any teenager angry about terror attacks. They appeal to anyone who can’t be bothered to think them through—can’t be bothered to ask not just the moral questions but the all-important practical one: Will doing this makes things better or worse? When you believe in your own genius, you don’t question your own flashes of inspiration.

Trump’s speeches and Twitter rants frequently focus on his poll standing, yet cherry-pick only those polls that are favorable, and his view of which pollsters are reliable is laughable to anyone who has followed the polling business in recent years.

Unlike successful campaigns of the past—in particular contrast to the massive Big Data and proprietary polling project that was crucial to President Obama’s 2012 re-election—Trump brags about having no polling operation of his own. He believes what he reads in the papers, if he likes it, and discards the rest. Nate Silver has noted how the short-term feedback loop in which Trump has been operating only encourages Trump’s confidence that he can keep prospering by doing the same things without adjusting his sources of information:

[I]t’s…possible that the Republican reluctance to criticize Trump stems from a surfeit of short-term thinking — combined with a possible misreading of the polls. Several times so far in the campaign, we’ve witnessed the following cycle: Trump says something offensive or ludicrous. Some pundits loudly proclaim that it could bring about the end of Trump’s campaign. Instead, Trump’s position remains steady or even improved in ballot-test polls. The same pundits therefore conclude that Trump is indestructible and impervious to criticism. [One] problem is that in a field that still has 14 candidates, more media coverage — even negative media coverage — potentially helps a candidate to…improve his position on the ballot test. In general, there has been a strong correlation between how well a candidate is performing on the ballot test and how much media coverage he’s receiving…Trump seems to understand this; indeed, he seems to issue his most controversial remarks and proposals precisely at moments of perceived vulnerability….Republicans are afraid to criticize Trump in part because it rarely produces instant gratification in a “win-the-morning” political culture that keeps score based on polls. Without seeing any repercussions, Trump goes farther out on a limb…

If this dynamic correctly describes the rest of the primary and general elections, then Trump does not need to learn and adapt in order to win. But most likely, it does not.

Making Trump Fight A Land War In Asia

The challenge Trump now faces is that the conditions of the summer and fall are not the same conditions under which the nomination will be decided. The battlefield will expand, and he must adjust his approach or meet the same fate as Imperial Japan.

The battlefield will expand, and he must adjust his approach or meet the same fate as Imperial Japan.

The most obvious reason is the size of the field. We are down from 17 candidates to 14, and if history is any guide, more than half of those 14 should be out of the race after South Carolina (the third state to vote).

As the number of candidates narrows, the share of the vote needed to win grows. Iowa’s Republican caucus has been won with as little as 24 to 26 percent of the vote (by Rick Santorum in 2012 and Bob Dole in 1996) and only once since 1980 has a candidate won 40 percent (George W. Bush winning 41 percent in 2000). New Hampshire has been won with as little as 27 percent (Pat Buchanan in 1996). McCain won 47.2 percent of the popular vote across all primaries in 2008; that was the lowest winning share of the GOP primary vote since 1976.

A candidate who can’t break out from 25 to 30 percent cannot win enough delegates to clinch the nomination. That’s what happened to factional candidates who limited their appeal to the grievances and resentments of a disproportionately downscale voter base, like Buchanan (20.8 percent of the vote in 1996) or Jesse Jackson (29.4 percent in 1988).

A candidate who can’t break out from 25 to 30 percent cannot win enough delegates to clinch the nomination.

While Trump’s hold on that 25 to 30 percent of the vote has been surprisingly consistent, national and early-state primary polls since Labor Day have shown no growth in his support. Meanwhile, an increasing number of potential GOP primary voters view Trump unfavorably. That suggests potential limits on his ability to scale his current voter base upwards as past frontrunners-turned-nominee have done—unless he can adjust his message to the needs of a changed battlefield dominated by voters not already on the Trump Train.

Instead, he seems determined to bask in the glow of the people already backing him, feeding them increasing quantities of what has already bound them to his candidacy. This is where the risk of a closed loop comes in, if Trump disdains polls and research of his own. If Trump keeps being gratified by crowd sizes, poll standing, and tweets showing him with a solid quarter of the public on his side, he will simply keep building a bigger wall between the voters he has and the voters he needs.

Bigger Voter Pools Dilute Trump’s Support

The second way the battlefield is changing is who the voters are. People responding to polls months before the election are not the same universe as the people who actually show up to vote in primaries, and even less so in caucuses. In November 2012, 129 million people voted (61 million for Mitt Romney), but only 18 million voted in the 2012 GOP primaries, about 12.5 percent of all registered voters and less than a third of all GOP general election voters.

People responding to polls months before the election are not the same universe as the people who actually show up to vote in primaries.

Iowa had 2.1 million registered voters in January 2012; 121,501 of them voted in the Republican caucus, around 5.7 percent. New Hampshire had about 767,000 registered voters in 2012; even with a primary open to Independents and no Democratic primary, 248,475 voted in 2012 GOP primary, about 32 percent.

Primary campaigns are hugely dependent on their ability to mobilize their voters to actually show up at the polls, and most every effort that has been made to narrow the polling universe to people likely to vote (by traditional metrics) has cut deeply into Trump’s poll support. That doesn’t mean he can’t turn out his voters, but it means he needs to open his OODA Loop to observe and orient himself towards the propensity of his poll supporters to vote, and make decisions and take action to make it happen.

The third way the primary battlefield shifts once the voting starts: the voters take it more seriously. They pay more attention, and many decide late. There are reams of polling and political-science evidence showing that voters tune in much more as an election gets closer, especially a primary election. A candidate like Trump, who has coasted on high name recognition, can see the electoral mood shift suddenly as voters take a closer look at him and at the alternatives.

A candidate like Trump, who has coasted on high name recognition, can see the electoral mood shift suddenly as voters take a closer look at him and at the alternatives.

Fourth, one of Trump’s major assets may degrade as he gets deeper into the primaries: his ambiguity about running third party. The more primaries he files in, the more states will follow Ohio in forcing him off the November ballot unless he files and wins a lawsuit challenging “sore loser” laws.

Also, the more he loses, the more the potential appeal of a Trump third-party run dims as he loses the “winner” sheen. Between April 26 and the July 21 end of the GOP convention, 13 states have deadlines for filing for the ballot, including Texas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, and Indiana.

The changing battlefield is not the only way his opponents could degrade Trump’s OODA Loop as the calendar turns. A truly sophisticated approach might also consider exploiting Trump’s vulnerability to misinformation. I remember once watching a mid-80s “Monday Night Baseball” broadcast where Howard Cosell, a great boxing and football announcer who knew nearly nothing about baseball, announced that Keith Hernandez had begged him before the game not to reveal that Hernandez’ lifetime batting average was .152.

A truly sophisticated approach might also consider exploiting Trump’s vulnerability to misinformation.

It’s possible that the original statistic given Cosell was not quite as ridiculous as that and he mangled it on-air, but it seemed pretty obvious that Hernandez had pranked Cosell with bad information, knowing he could take advantage of Cosell’s inability to distinguish good information about baseball statistics from bad. A candidate who will quote Infowars stories in campaign speeches and retweet random white supremacists and made-up statistics is exceptionally vulnerable to being fed misinformation that will blow up in his face like a cartoon exploding cigar.

The two candidates best positioned to surge past Trump in the spring of 2016 are a pair of much younger men noted for their quickness of mind and gifts as extemporaneous speakers: Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. Each has showcased a distinct approach to expanding the battlefield and shifting the ground on their opponents.

The Ground War: Ted Cruz and the Grassroots

Cruz’s strategy to get past Trump and his other opponents seems to rely on four prongs: (1) altering the opponent’s reality by using grassroots turnout to change the electorate; (2) exploiting the sequential nature of the primary calendar to create momentum; (3) leveraging to Cruz’s advantage how Trump has reshaped the debate; and (4) using ambiguity to leverage Trump’s own ambiguity against Cruz’s unambiguously loyal Republican opponents.

First, it’s notable that Cruz and his oddly disorganized coterie of SuperPACs have spent almost as little money on TV ads as Trump, yet this has not stopped him from pulling into first place in Iowa, second in national polls, and fourth in New Hampshire. Why?

Partly due to his strong built-in brand identity as the Senate’s “Mr. Conservative” and bête noir of DC Republicans, but also in part because he has invested his strong fundraising haul heavily into the kinds of grassroots organizing and digital voter targeting that was the hallmark of the Obama campaign’s ability to expand the Left end of the electorate. As a recent Washington Post profile described the thinking behind the Cruz micro-targeting and voter-profiling operation:

Cruz’s campaign manager, Jeff Roe…explained the campaign’s heavy investment in data and analysis. It’s critical because of changes in the nature of the electorate, popular media, polling and campaign finance law, which make many of the old axioms of campaigning — gathering endorsements, purchasing high-cost broadcast ads — less valuable…’There is no handbook for this,’ the Missouri-based political consultant said of running a presidential campaign in 2016. ‘The conventional wisdom has been destroyed. What you can do is rely on data.’

Cruz’s “psychographics”-based operation has its critics, but if it works, just as Trump is targeting the electorate that responds to polls, Cruz will change the electorate that shows up on caucus or primary day, so that by the time Trump adjusts, his information is already obsolete—a classic Boydian strategy.

Even if Trump’s wealth is as liquid as he likes to portray, he has been markedly unenthusiastic about spending his personal fortune on this campaign.

Moreover, the advantage of countering Trump with grassroots organizing rather than a TV ad air war is that it is resource-intensive and bypasses the mainstream media. Just as Obama (who had a lot more help from the media at a macro level, despite his losses of petty-ante news cycles) was able to deploy his financial edge over McCain by digital data-mining and ground organizing and thus render cable news cycles less relevant, Cruz can use his own small-donor-driven financial edge fly under the radar of Trump’s massive advantage in free media and confront Trump with a strategic picture that forces Trump (if he recognizes his danger) to spend his own money. With a campaign whose fundraising capabilities consist mainly of selling trucker hats, that means reaching into Trump’s personal pockets.

For a man who claims to be worth $10 billion, that should be no great effort, but even if Trump’s wealth is as liquid as he likes to portray, he has been markedly unenthusiastic about spending his personal fortune on this campaign. That doesn’t mean Trump has no ground organization—there have been reports since August that Trump was building a ground campaign in Iowa—but it clearly forces him onto a broader battlefield that neutralizes some of his advantages and forces him to choose between a fight he does not really want and continued dominance of a subsidiary loop.

Defeating the Winner Perception

Second, despite Trump’s apparent strength in national polls, Cruz’s targeting of Iowa focuses on the most logical schwerpunkt for defeating Trump (puncturing his air of being a winner) by using the sequential nature of primaries to hand him a defeat in the first state to actually vote.

There is logic in Cruz saving his TV ad money until the field narrows.

Cruz’s further focus on South Carolina and the March 1 “SEC Primary” targets Rubio as well by aiming to build a string of wins that deliver a knockout blow before Rubio can clear the rest of the competition out of the way and get enough wins of his own to keep fundraising and momentum alive for the second half of the calendar, which favors Rubio.

This is fairly traditional strategy—think of Napoleon defeating Austria and Russia in sequence at Austerlitz before the Prussians could even enter the war. And there is logic in Cruz saving his TV ad money until the field narrows and he can see the whites of his opponents’ eyes, given what we have learned about the futility of SuperPAC TV ads in the crowded 2016 field compared to their use in sequential one-on-one battles in 2012.

Like his grassroots strategy, Cruz’s approach depends on whether he is right in his observational hypothesis of who the potential voters are—he has seemed prone to wishful thinking in this regard—but if the underlying theory of his campaign is correct, this aspect of his strategy is the optimal way to pursue it, with or without Trump in the field.

A Learning Robot

Cruz’s third and fourth strategic choices are improvisations in response to how Trump reshaped the battlespace. They show more flexibility and learning capacity than Cruz’s critics might suspect. Cruz’s major vulnerability is being painted as an unelectable Goldwater-esque extremist even within the context of the GOP, let alone the general electorate.

Trump may be shifting the ‘Overton Window’ and Cruz is opportunistically drafting in his wake.

But the high profile of Trump, the extreme positions he has taken on some issues (especially immigration), and his overall air of irresponsible anti-establishment rage combine to make Cruz (an Ivy League-pedigreed senator who served in the Bush administration and was appointed to a senior position by the man now serving as governor of Texas) seem positively reassuring by comparison. Trump may be shifting the “Overton Window” (the perceived boundaries of what is and is not acceptable public discourse) and Cruz is opportunistically drafting in his wake.

Cruz could even make a similar virtue of having Rubio as his chief “moderate” opposition. Because Rubio’s own record is so conservative and he agrees with Cruz on so many issues, it will be difficult for Rubio to paint Cruz as outside the mainstream without condemning himself.

Where Trump has created ambiguity around his threat to run third party, Cruz has exploited it by ostentatiously refusing to criticize Trump. At one point, after reports surfaced of Cruz making some fairly tame comments to a fundraiser about Trump’s fitness to be president, Trump launched an opening shot across the bow:

Like like @tedcruz is getting ready to attack. I am leading by so much he must. I hope so, he will fall like all others. Will be easy!



— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 11, 2015

.@tedcruz should not make statements behind closed doors to his bosses, he should bring them out into the open – more fun that way!



— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 11, 2015



Cruz responded, not by counterattacking Trump, but by embracing him:

The Establishment's only hope: Trump & me in a cage match. Sorry to disappoint — @realDonaldTrump is terrific. #DealWithIt



— Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) December 11, 2015



This creates two levels of ambiguity. One, it raises the question what Cruz is up to. Is he courting Trump’s voters? Is he appeasing Trump himself to deter a third-party bid? Are they somehow in cahoots? Is Cruz catering to hitherto Trump-friendly talk radio hosts, some of whom (like Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin) may be starting to turn on Trump because Trump attacked Cruz first?

The second level of ambiguity is an attack on what may be Rubio’s greatest asset: the perception that he is more likely to win a general election than Cruz. If Cruz can make primary voters believe that only he can sideline Trump—that the choice is not Rubio-Hillary or Cruz-Hillary, but Rubio-Hillary-Trump or Cruz-Hillary—he can alter the voter decision-making calculus that underlies Rubio’s pitch.

The Air War: 40-Second Rubio

Rubio seems to be pursuing a different strategy than Cruz, relying on (1) his ability to communicate and maneuver in a dynamic mass-media environment, (2) his ability to exploit the endgame conditions of a Republican primary, and (3) using ambiguity to mask his approach to grassroots voter turnout.

The obvious schwerpunkt for any GOP primary attack on Rubio is his involvement with the “Gang of Eight” immigration bill in early 2013.

First, debate moments like his missed-votes showdown with Jeb have demonstrated Rubio’s ability to read a scene and deliver an attack on what had been a perceived vulnerability. But perhaps even a better example of his skill in this regard was displayed in a mid-November dustup with Cruz over immigration.

The obvious schwerpunkt for any GOP primary attack on Rubio is his involvement with the “Gang of Eight” immigration bill in early 2013. It’s the heavy artillery, the one moment of Rubio’s career that raises questions of trust, judgment, and consistency on an issue of importance to many primary voters, especially those drawn to Trump that Cruz may want to peel off.

Yet Cruz engaged Rubio on the issue in the second week of November, unexpectedly early in the game. Rubio’s campaign immediately turned the debate into questions about how different Cruz’s own proposals really were, citing amendments and testimony Cruz offered in early 2013 discussing (among other things) expanded legal immigration and openness to eventual legal status for illegal aliens.

Rubio’s campaign immediately turned the debate into questions about how different Cruz’s own proposals really were.

Cruz was forced to argue Senate procedure to contend that his amendments were poison pills not reflective of his own beliefs, and was rushed quickly into releasing his own immigration position paper, something he clearly would not otherwise have done on a Friday afternoon in November. In a surprisingly short time, on an issue of maximum vulnerability for Rubio, he had nonetheless reversed positions and gotten on Cruz’s six—a performance worthy of “40 Second Rubio.”

That’s not an easy trick to pull on Cruz, a veteran debater and advocate known for his ability to turn the tables on ambush interviewers and launch extemporaneous attacks in response to unexpected Senate parliamentary moves. But conditions are never static; just a few hours later, the terrorist attack in Paris wiped the whole back-and-forth off the front pages.

Moderation Is a Virtue

Second, the delegate rules and the primary calendar naturally favor a more moderate candidate who can appeal to blue-state and purple-state Republicans who may be more receptive to whichever candidate seems most electable. This is a different kind of expansion of the battlefield from the early-state polling environment.

Rubio has shown that he has the rare Protean political talent of remaking his ideological identity while actually changing very little in the way of his positions.

“Moderate” is not really Rubio’s brand, given his history as a conservative Florida House Speaker who fought his state’s moderate Republican governor (Charlie Crist), endorsed Mike Huckabee in 2008, and launched a Tea Party challenge that drove Crist from the party in a bitter 2010 primary.

But then, Rubio has shown before that he has the rare Protean political talent of remaking his ideological identity while actually changing very little in the way of his positions, shifting his hue for different audiences and times without leaving behind a lot of the kind of embarrassing flip-flops that less preternaturally skilled operators like Trump and Hillary Clinton must contend with.

Thus, the man who started his political career in the Miami office of the Dole-Kemp campaign remade himself as a nuts-and-bolts local West Miami city commissioner, moved into a new district to become a State representative, moved up the ladder as a Jeb Bush loyalist, led the assault on Crist from the Right, reinvented himself as a Tea Partier, set out to brand himself in DC as a foreign policy neoconservative and immigration bridge-builder and deal-maker, then launched a presidential bid aimed at uniting the establishment and Tea Party factions directly into the teeth of Jeb.

With Walker’s collapse, Rubio has little competition for the role of party uniter, so he has aimed to wait out Cruz’s early-state advantage.

Somehow, he has managed all this while remaining mostly consistent in his stances on issues, and is selling himself as a new generation of leadership even though he has spent more than twice as many years in elected office as Hillary Clinton.

With Walker’s collapse, Rubio has little competition for the role of party uniter, so he has aimed to wait out Cruz’s early-state advantage and use the short timeframe leading into the March/April blitz to leverage his advantage in TV communications and his superior positioning in later states to overfly Cruz. But Rubio has some local outreach tricks up his sleeve too, like his use of his youthful years as a Nevada Mormon to build ties with a crucial bloc in the last of the four early states, where he may need a win.

Perhaps Rubio Is Cloaking Himself

Third, Rubio’s team has been unusually reticent about running to the press to describe what they are doing. That has created a lot of uncertainty. It could just be a smoke screen, but it keeps his adversaries off-balance. A recent National Review article hit Rubio for undervaluing the Iowa grassroots and left readers with the distinct impression that he plans a campaign heavy on national TV exposure and light on ground operations:

Rubio’s team believes…that a sprawling operation weighs down a campaign and wastes precious resources that could be spent on TV ads that reach more voters. The senator’s lieutenants have pointed to Bush and Walker…as proof positive that organizational heft is overrated…The nominating process is certainly becoming more nationalized, and Rubio’s team believes television spots, media coverage, and momentum are key…Rubio has spent just 27 days this campaign season on the ground in Iowa…Terry Sullivan, Rubio’s campaign manager, gave a window into his team’s air-heavy strategy…when he told the New York Times this week: ‘More people in Iowa see Marco on ‘Fox and Friends’ than see Marco when he is in Iowa.’…The Rubio campaign’s attitude is…that massive field operations are no guarantee of success.

That could be a risky play, unless Rubio’s team has correctly assessed the significance of the timing and terrain of 2016, at least on behalf of a uniquely telegenic candidate. Analysts of recent campaigns have criticized GOP reliance on TV advertising as unduly costly and diminishing in its returns and warned of the dangers of failing to build a modern online campaign structure. The presence of many Romney 2012 veterans on Rubio’s team also has savvy observers wondering if he has hired people capable of learning the lessons of Romney’s defeat.

Perhaps stung by this reaction, Rubio’s campaign grudgingly cooperated with David Drucker’s response in the Washington Examiner:

Rubio’s organization doesn’t appear as unprepared for the coming ground war as his opponents had hoped…[an] assessment…shared…during multiple interviews with GOP Insiders in Iowa and other states, including Rubio supporters and neutral players. Tom Mitchell…told the Examiner in late October…that he believed Rubio’s Iowa field operation wasn’t receiving due credit. Mitchell, who hasn’t endorsed in the primary, said his opinion hasn’t changed…Some senior Iowa Republicans predicted…that Rubio was poised to surprise the naysayers. They chocked up the negative reviews of his ground game both to opponents who are naturally looking to blunt his momentum — and his campaign’s strategic decision not to broadcast every tactical advance it achieves… ‘The campaign is getting ready to release a list of supporters,’ said an Iowa Republican backing Rubio. ‘I think people are going to be surprised — at least Iowa people will be surprised — by who’s on this team.’…’Rubio has a stronger team than people know,” added a Hawkeye State Republican insider who is neutral and requested anonymity in order to speak candidly. ‘I travel around the state a lot; I see his people at those meetings. For some reason, the Rubio camp just hasn’t announced who they are yet.’

So, which is it? Ambiguity abounds, but does it conceal hidden strength or weakness? There are five distinct possibilities regarding Rubio’s ground operation:

He doesn’t have much of a ground game, and will fail spectacularly as a result; He doesn’t have much of a ground game, and will demonstrate that a TV-centric national strategy can work for a charismatic candidate in a time-compressed primary calendar; He doesn’t have much of a traditional ground game, but is balancing it with a strong digital organizing game similar to Obama’s in 2008 and 2012; He has a stronger ground game than he is letting on, sees no reason to disclose what he’s doing, and hopes to catch his opponents by surprise; or He doesn’t have much of a ground game, but is planning to do what amounts to a buyout of Jeb Bush’s extensive infrastructure once he can force Jeb out of the race.

Regardless of the answer, Rubio’s opponents lack the kind of advance notice of his real tactical play that they have for Cruz and Jeb, who have made their bets in the open.

That 90s Show: The Dial-Up Speed of Hillary Clinton

Whoever the Republicans nominate, the advantages of a Boydian approach in confronting Hillary Clinton are obvious. Clinton’s strengths as a candidate are well-known and heavily dependent on factors that are already fixed (name recognition, gender, long tenure in the public eye) or depend on maintaining the demographic conditions of the last war. Her weaknesses also include some fixed factors (her age, her established negatives).

Clinton’s calculating approach rarely works well when she is caught out in public before she can make up her mind and poll-test the desired approach.

But other strengths and weaknesses should not be underestimated. On the plus side, she’s the classic A+ student who combines brains with thorough preparation for a predictable event like the Benghazi hearings, friendly interviews and press conferences, and debates with Democratic opponents. On the negative side, she is notoriously uncomfortable with spontaneity of all kinds. Chaos is not Hillary Clinton’s friend.

Clinton is a shrewd operator who is perfectly comfortable with adjusting her positions to her political advantage. But her calculating approach rarely works well when she is caught out in public before she can make up her mind and poll-test the desired approach.

This was graphically displayed in late 2007 when she was trapped in a debate waffling on questions about drivers’ licenses for illegal immigrants before she had time to formulate a pat response. Her press conferences on email storage and deletion, a subject she clearly doesn’t fully understand, have been disastrous. And her inner circle is not only dominated by sycophants ill-suited to ensuring she operates in an open system, it also includes a lot of people who have been with her since the 1990s (despite the addition of some Team Obama folks). Her core of advisers look like the cast of “Cocoon.”

All of this calls into question whether age and isolation will leave the 68-year-old Clinton and her team ill-prepared to operate in the 2016 campaign environment if it proves more chaotic and fast-moving, and her opponent (or opponents) more nimble and versed in speed, ambiguity, and deception.

To their credit, the Clinton team seems to grasp the problem, at least in general terms—a recent New York Times profile of the Clinton campaign’s efforts to improve its operational relationship with the Democratic National Committee acknowledges that work needs to be done to bring the Clinton operation up to speed:

In recent weeks, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign aides have started to scrutinize what have historically been core functions of the party committee, some of which atrophied under President Obama, according to people briefed on the reviews. The reviews have been undertaken at the request of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager, Robby Mook, who has taken a particular interest in how the research and communications operations are functioning, according to the people briefed, who asked for anonymity to discuss private deliberations. Among the questions her team is looking at, gingerly, are staffing and dexterity in combating an increasingly unpredictable Republican field….for Mrs. Clinton, who has taken a while to adjust to the era of super PACs, the D.N.C. has been a logical place for her advisers to direct donors.

On the other hand, below the senior leadership level, Hillary will be able to draw on a potentially even more sophisticated digital turnout operation than the one Obama wielded. Thus, the weak link in her team may well be the candidate herself, and her speed and dexterity in adapting to a fluid situation. Even the best of militaries can rarely survive an ossified senior command structure.

How Trump Would Struggle against Hillary

Could Trump exploit these vulnerabilities? Possibly. Certainly his lack of loyalty to the Republican Party, its ideas, or its prior positions gives him the ideological flexibility to attack Hillary from some unexpected directions, and he would be likely to score a hit now and then in the same way McCain did to Obama—strike a nerve here, embarrass her there.

Trump’s appeal has very little natural overlap with the existing Democratic base, and would likely inflame many of the people Clinton may otherwise struggle to excite.

But Trump’s appeal has very little natural overlap with the existing Democratic base, and would likely inflame many of the people Clinton may otherwise struggle to excite. One of the lessons of elections past is that bomb-throwing candidates who are fun and disruptive when they are first in the race become easily ignored when they fall far behind, like Alan Keyes running against Obama for the Senate in 2004 or Carl Paladino (the most Trump-ish candidate in recent memory) running against Andrew Cuomo in 2010.

As a major-party nominee, moreover, Trump would lack the ambiguity he has deployed against Republicans, and in a two- or even three-candidate race, he could not exploit the collective action problems and Hobbesian scramble for free media that have enabled his rise. Indeed, few of the factors that have allowed Trump to trigger fear in his Republican opponents would even apply in a general election, and Clinton’s team would have plenty of time to prepare a counter to the things he has been doing so far.

That’s not to say that Trump’s celebrity and attention-grabbing power would present no opportunity to win (he would only be the nominee if he’d already figured out how to solve the low-turnout proclivities of his natural base), but ultimately, he could not deploy the same approach without major adaptations. Trump would have to prove himself flexible and open-minded enough to the dynamic general election system to attract the necessary 70 million voters. His ability to do so remains very much unproven.

Few of the factors that have allowed Trump to trigger fear in his Republican opponents would even apply in a general election.

Do Rubio and Cruz have that ability to operate inside Clinton’s OODA Loop, shifting the ground under her feet without being trapped themselves in a self-reinforcing closed loop? That too is unproven so far.

But both men are 24 years younger and have shown an impressive adaptability of a different kind so far, Cruz with his ground game, Rubio in his skill at bobbing and weaving. Of the two, it seems more likely that Rubio’s skillset is the one more ideally suited to exploiting a candidate who is overly deliberate in her ability to communicate and her feel for a fast-moving environment.

Either could potentially ride a Boydian approach to political strategy to the White House. Both would be well-advised to try.

4 Things Obama Prioritized Over Visiting San Bernardino,"President Obama will make a pit stop in San Bernardino on Friday to visit the families of the 14 victims who were gunned down by during a terrorist attack on December 2. This means Obama has waited two weeks before visiting the site of the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11.

Worse, he’s not even bothering to go out of his way to mourn the loss of 14 American lives. He’s stopping in San Bernardino on his way to his family’s annual Christmas vacation in Hawaii, which cost taxpayers $16 million last year.

I’m not criticizing the Obamas for taking a vacation, but I am angry that he is making this a political pit stop in the backyard of my childhood hometown on his way to a fun-filled getaway. If the loss of 14 American lives isn’t enough of a reason to get Obama on a plane out to the West Coast, I’m not really sure what is. Apparently it takes a Hawaiian vacation to get the president to make an appearance at the site of the attack he has used to push stricter gun laws.

So why didn’t President Obama visit San Bernardino sooner? What was so important that it kept him from flying out to mourn with the families of the victims?

Besides pushing for the power to take away one’s constitutional rights on a whim, here are four other things Obama thought were more important than visiting the site of the San Bernardino attack.

1. A Conversation About Gun Safety

Two days after the attack, Obama met with former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who survived a gunshot wound to the head during a failed assassination attempt in 2011, to talk about gun safety. Apparently Obama is under the delusion that a conversation about gun safety will keep America safe from terrorist attacks.

2. A Party

When Obama addressed the nation from the Oval Office on December 6, four days after the attack, much of his comments centered around a push for more gun control laws. His remarks seemed to dismiss radical Islam as the cause of the attack, and instead placed the blame on gun violence.

Right after his message to America, he slipped into a tux and threw a party at the White House for the Kennedy Center Honors.

3. An A Capella Concert

On Dec. 9, Obama hosted Israeli President Reuven Rivlin during his visit to the United States, and the two attended a private a capella concert. While welcoming a foreign dignitary is certainly important, it’s odd that the president prioritized a concert over visiting the site of a terrorist attack.

#HappyHanukkah from the White House, and the @maccabeats! A video posted by The White House (@whitehouse) on Dec 9, 2015 at 6:26pm PST

The question persists: Why didn’t President Obama take time during the week between the attack and this concert to express solidarity with survivors of the attack and the neighboring community by making an appearance in San Bernardino?

4. Politicize a Naturalization Ceremony

On Thursday, Obama plans to attend a naturalization ceremony, where he will speak about tolerance and “reframe the national conversation” about immigration.

This is a nice gesture and I’m sure these soon-to-be American citizens will remember it forever, but Obama isn’t choosing to attend it to support these new Americans, he’s using it as an opportunity to further politicize immigration.

Unfortunately, it seems that Obama isn’t interested in events or public appearances that don’t further his political agenda. His decision to wait two weeks before announcing an impromptu pit-stop sends the message that he can’t be bothered to go out of his way to visit the site of a tragedy that has forever changed everyday American life. Perhaps the trip to Hawaii will clear his head and help him deal more honestly with terrorism and face the truth about the threat radical Islam poses to the safety of his fellow Americans who entrusted him with that duty.

Ehh, probably not.

The NYT Just Disappeared A Devastating Obama Admission,"A story published by the New York Times late Thursday night caused some major media waves. The story, which was written by reporters Peter Baker and Gardiner Harris, included a remarkable admission by Obama about his response to the recent terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California.

By Friday morning, however, the entire passage containing Obama’s admission had been erased from the story without any explanation from the New York Times. Here’s the passage that was included in the story when it was published Thursday night, courtesy of CNN’s Brian Stelter:

Obama needs more cable news in his media diet? Revealing comment in a private meeting with newspaper columnists… pic.twitter.com/iUHz6Ey38g



Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) December 18, 2015

In his meeting with the columnists, Mr. Obama indicated that he did not see enough cable television to fully appreciate the anxiety after the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, and made clear that he plans to step up his public arguments. Republicans were telling Americans that he is not doing anything when he is doing a lot, he said.

The version of the New York Times story that was published early Thursday evening indicated that Obama knew he was out of touch with the country on terrorism, and he thought that was due to not watching enough television. Obama critics immediately pounced on the stunning admission from the president, expressing shock that he would claim that a lack of TV time was the real reason for him not understanding Americans’ anxiety about terrorism.

As of Friday morning, however, the passage containing Obama’s admission was gone. Newsdiffs.org, a web site which captures changes made to online news stories, indicates that the major revision to the NYT story happened late on Thursday night, several hours after the story was published (text with a red background and strike-through is text that was eliminated from the story; text with a green background is text that was added to the story since its last revision):

NYT: Oh that part embarrassed the boss? So sorry, we'll delete it ASAP. https://t.co/uc7L9yEhaa pic.twitter.com/ME8WJauXZ5



Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) December 18, 2015

The unexplained deletion of that major passage wasn’t the only significant change made to the story since it was first published. New York Times editors also changed the story’s headline four separate times, according to Newsdiffs.org. Each headline revision either put Obama in a better light or put the GOP in a worse one.

The original headline when the story was first published was “Obama Visiting National Counterterrorism Center.” Less than two hours later, the headline was “Obama, at Counterterrorism Center, Offers Assurances On Safety.” Then the headline was changed to “Frustrated by Republican Critics, Obama Defends Muted Response to Attacks.” Two hours later, the headline was once again revised to “Under Fire From G.O.P., Obama Defends Response to Terror Attacks.” The most recent headline revision, which accompanied the deletion of the passage where Obama admitted he didn’t understand the American public’s anxiety about terrorism, now reads, “Assailed by G.O.P., Obama Defends His Response To Terror Attacks.”

The addition (116 words) was much longer than the deletion (66 words) of the section that made Obama look bad. https://t.co/CAqgHVDbyN



Sean Davis (@seanmdav) December 18, 2015

Baker and Gardiner, the two reporters who authored the NYT story, have yet to explain why Obama’s admission about being out of touch with the public on terrorism was deleted from their story.

UPDATE #1: The New York Times claimed in a statement late Friday morning that its deletion of the Obama passage was not “unusual” and that it was merely “trimmed for space in the print paper”:

Statement from NY Times re: deleting that passage about President Obama not recognizing anxiety over terrorism. pic.twitter.com/PwZngc88G2



T. Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) December 18, 2015

The problem with this explanation is that it doesn’t make any sense when you review the first major online revision, which Newsdiffs.org archived at 10:21 p.m. EST. In that version, only one substantive revision was made: the paragraph about Obama not watching enough cable TV was removed and replaced with two paragraphs about Obama’s plan to combat ISIS.

The section that was removed contained 66 words. The section that was added in its place contained 116 words. If the New York Times was indeed “trimming for space” in that particular revision, it will need to explain why its revision to that section added 50 words.

UPDATE #2: Thanks to this CNN story on Obama’s remarks before an audience of progressive writers, we now know why the NYT deceptively memory-holed Obama’s admission that he was ignorant of Americans’ terrorism anxiety, and why the NYT refused to divulge the real reason behind its stealth edits: Obama didn’t want that remark attributed to him.

Here’s how CNN described the meeting and its ground rules:

The meeting, which took place in the White House Roosevelt Room, included journalists, columnists and editors from the Times, The Washington Post and The Atlantic, as well as digital outlets like Yahoo, Slate, Vox and Mic. Per the ground rules, attendees were not allowed to discuss the meeting or attribute any remarks to the president (emphasis added).



Yet the purpose of these off-the-record meetings, which have been a feature of Obama’s tenure, is to influence the national dialogue. The White House achieved that goal on Wednesday when the Post’s David Ignatius, who was at the meeting, penned a column based almost entirely on Obama’s remarks without any mention of the meeting.



In addition to detailing Obama’s thoughts on his ISIS strategy, Ignatius’ column alluded to the president’s remark about cable news: “Obama seems to have realized that he was slow to respond to public fear after the jihadist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif.,” Ignatius wrote. “His low-decibel approach led the public to worry he wasn’t doing enough to keep the country safe. Obama, not a cable television fan, apparently didn’t realize the state of anxiety.”

The NYT excuse that it had to erase the mention of Obama’s remarks due to space constraints–even though its initial revision and deletion of those remarks actually added 50 words to the story–now looks even more absurd. It’s completely obvious what happened. The White House wanted all these reporters and writers to act as stenographers of the president’s spin, just so long as they pretended the spin never came from him.

In his column on the meeting, the Washington Posts‘s David Ignatius did exactly what Obama wanted him to do: regurgitate Obama’s spin and blame cable news for stirring up anxiety about terrorism. Obama’s remark was meant to accomplish two things: 1) to place him above the fray–he has far more important things to do than just sit around and watch silly cable news programs all day, and 2) to subtly place blame on cable news (guess which network he had in mind) for ginning up fears–unfounded in Obama’s mind–of future terrorist attacks.

The Obama team’s spin cycle would’ve continued without a hitch, if not for that messy little New York Times article which not only attributed the remarks to Obama, but reported them in a way that made Obama look obscenely aloof and out of touch with the concerns of most Americans.

The solution? Easy: just demand that the NYT eliminate the remarks entirely. Problem solved, except for one thing. The Internet never forgets.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/12/18/the-new-york-times-just-memory-holed-this-devastating-obama-admission/,2015-12-18
Donald Trump Is Not A Proxy For Vladimir Putin,"Can the way a candidate handles Trump tell you something about how he will handle Putin? Liberal journalists have been asking this recently to discredit mainstream conservative candidates who are otherwise presumed to be strong on foreign policy.

Last week, the main super-PAC supporting Hillary Clinton released a television ad picking up on the theme. The clip likens the Republican candidates to pussycats and poses the question: “If they can’t even stand up to Donald Trump, why would anyone think they are strong enough to lead America?” But the answer to this rhetorical question might disappoint those hoping Trump’s bull in a China shop routine will take down the rest of the field.

Egging On the Fracas

Whether he is talking about Muslims, illegal immigrants, women, or just about any other subject, Donald Trump says outrageous things regularly. This pleases the media, not only because it boosts their ratings and allows them to signal their own virtue by condemning his every word, but because they realize that if Trump becomes the GOP nominee, Clinton will cruise to the White House. As pleasant as this situation is for them, they also understand that they need to hedge their bets and focus some attention on why we should despise the other Republican candidates just as much as they do Trump.

Some pundits have discovered that Trump himself is the best weapon to use against the Republican field. It is an easy formula: goad a candidate into attacking Trump, then sit back and enjoy Trump’s counter-attack. If the candidate does not take the bait, attack the candidate for not having the courage to fight Trump. They are like that kid in the schoolyard trying to stir up a fight: “You going to let him get away with saying that? Bok, bok, bok! Chicken!”

Some pundits have discovered that Trump himself is the best weapon to use against the Republican field.

Peter Beinart of The Atlantic best typifies this special brand of punditry. He calls the Republican candidates—all of them—“political cowards” for not expressing adequately heartfelt disapproval of Trump. “Bush, Kasich, and the other GOP candidates won’t clearly repudiate Trump because they’re afraid of angering his voters,” writes Beinart. “They’re also afraid of angering him.”

Taken as sincere claims, Beinart’s assertions are demonstrably false. Many candidates have vigorously denounced Trump. Sen. Rand Paul has called Trump a clown, and relentlessly attacked him to kick off the first debate. Ohio Gov. John Kasich took a similar approach, denouncing Trump as an unserious candidate in the third debate. Beinart’s own article references a Kasich ad comparing Trump to Hitler.

Scott Walker and Rick Perry have already fallen on their swords and suspended their campaigns largely as a consequence of attacking Trump. Before his exit, Walker had this to say of Trump: “He offers a barking carnival act that can be best described as Trumpism: a toxic mix of demagoguery, mean-spiritedness and nonsense that will lead the Republican Party to perdition if pursued.” He didn’t exactly mince words.

Respond to Trump 24/7 Or You’re Not Serious, Like Me

But this isn’t enough for the liberal commentariat. Presumably, unless all the candidates are at all times thumping their chests and virtue-signaling over Trump’s latest zinger, they are cowards. Take, for example, what Beinart has to say about Bush’s criticism of Trump’s proposal to build a wall along the Mexican border. Beinart notes that Bush traveled to the Texas border and denounced Trump’s proposal. By Beinart’s own account, Bush said: “Mr. Trump’s plans are not grounded in conservative principles. His proposal is unrealistic. It would cost hundreds of billions of dollars.”

But The Atlantic columnist has no patience for reasoned argumentation. As far as he’s concerned, Bush missed an opportunity to signal his virtue by calling Trump a bigot. Therefore, we are supposed to believe Bush is too much of a coward to be the president of the United States? That’s some penetrating analysis.

Beinart is not alone, of course. Look at this tweet from The Guardian’s Ben Jacobs:

3 hours later . . . https://t.co/jUkaigUD1J



— Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) December 8, 2015

Yes, the gall of Sen. Marco Rubio to not hover over his laptop so he can respond in real time to every half-baked proposal Trump comes out with. Is Jacobs seriously insinuating that Rubio spent those three hours thinking deeply about whether he agreed with Trump’s musings about not letting Muslims into the country? Anybody remotely familiar with the differences between Trump and Rubio on foreign policy would find that ridiculous.

In a variation on the theme, Paul Waldman writing for The Week complains, “the worst any of them can bring themselves to say is that Trump’s ideas are nutty. Not that he’s a bigot, not that he’s using the politics of hate, not that he’s falling in line with a sordid history of racism.”

The Appropriate Response Is a Sidestep

What these commentators don’t seem to understand is that there is more to running for president than calling people names. Any candidate running for president needs to do two things: 1) make his or her own case for the presidency and 2) demonstrate that he or she is better suited than the other people running. That is it. There is no requirement to obsessively comment on what one particular candidate has to say, no matter how headline-grabbing.

Presumably, unless all the candidates are at all times thumping their chests and virtue-signaling over Trump’s latest zinger, they are cowards.

Rubio’s strategy for dealing with Trump, for example, is spot-on. This August on “Meet The Press,” he said, “I’ve made a decision here with Donald Trump, you know, if I comment on everything he says, my whole campaign will be consumed by it. That’s all I’ll do all day. We’ll let him answer for what he says and so forth. At this point, I mean, we’ve got to focus on our message. Otherwise, my whole campaign will be what — how do you feel about what Donald Trump said about something. He says something every day.” That is how a rational adult runs for president. Rubio’s campaign is about Rubio, and it is juvenile to insinuate he is a coward or a “pussy” for that.

I also question the premise underlying these attack pieces that there is something cowardly about choosing not to alienate Trump’s supporters. The bulk of Trump’s supporters, contrary to popular belief, are not knuckle-dragging racist xenophobes. Trump takes a shock jock approach in order to gain attention and bring certain issues center stage. His followers may not be policy wonks, but they know the present system is not working for them.

These people, like Trump, may not have a lot of workable solutions, but they are reacting to real concerns. A wise candidate would sidestep Trump, not just denounce him, and start offering the people flocking to him realistic solutions. Rubio takes exactly that approach in his own new campaign commercial, in which he shows respect and empathy for the fears and frustrations driving people toward anti-establishment candidates.

Notice the Double Standard for Democrats

I would be remiss not to point out the Left’s double standard here. Let’s look for a moment at some of the outrageous things Clinton has said. She said, for instance, that she would bring to justice the people who made that film offending Muhammad. She said this to the grieving families of those killed in Benghazi days after she told her daughter and the Egyptian prime minister that protests over the film had nothing to do with the attack, and that American personnel had been killed in a terrorist attack.

I have never understood why public figures are expected to condemn the inappropriate remarks or actions of other people.

Do Democrats think Bernie Sanders is a coward for not condemning Clinton’s cynicism? Not only did Sanders ignore Clinton’s disgraceful treatment of the families (not to mention the broader public she supposedly served) he goes out of his way to chastise the few people in the press who are actually talking about her flagrant lies.

Last month, Clinton claimed in a tweet, “Every survivor of sexual assault deserves to be heard, believed, and supported.” That is the standard anti-due process line advanced by progressives these days, so no Democrat would be expected to condemn that remark. But should we hold her fellow Democratic presidential candidates to account for not seizing the opportunity to express moral outrage over a legal defense strategy she previously adopted that painted a 12-year-rape victim as someone who was emotionally unstable and sought older men? Are Sanders and O’Malley cowards for letting that slide?

To be clear, I have never understood why public figures are expected to condemn the inappropriate remarks or actions of other people. The same goes for apologies. The question “Do you think so-and-so needs to apologize?” makes me sick every time I hear it. I am here pointing only to the double standard of the press demanding Republicans answer for Trump, but not asking Democrats to answer for Clinton.

Presidential Politics Isn’t Foreign Policy

All of this faux concern over the Republicans’ alleged timidity tells us something important about what the hard Left thinks it means to be tough on foreign adversaries. Here’s Beinart: “When it comes to Vladimir Putin, ISIS, and Iran, the GOP candidates love denouncing ‘appeasement.’ Yet when it comes to Trump, appeasement is their core strategy.”

Being tough means formulating clear objectives, settling on a strategy to reach those goals, and not veering from that strategy just because the other guy wants you to.

So Beinart thinks the Republicans should deal with Trump in the same way they would deal with Putin and other global menaces? On its face, this is absurd. Trump is a populist running to be the presidential nominee of his party. He may be a bit crass, but he is not a revanchist Eurasian autocrat. He is not suspected of having a secret nuclear weapons program. He hasn’t cut off anyone’s head. Each of these problems requires different strategies, and all of them require a different form of toughness.

Being tough with Putin requires bolstering the defenses of the neighbors he is bullying, applying financial pressure through sanctions, and countering his propaganda by exposing his lies. Being tough with the Iranians would have meant holding firm to our objectives in negotiating with them, expressing a willingness to walk away from the table, and calling them out for lying and cheating. Being tough with ISIS . . . well, suffice it to say it would begin with recognizing that they are motivated by a radical Islamic ideology.

Basically, being tough means formulating clear objectives based on your values and interests, settling on a strategy to reach those goals, and not veering from that strategy just because the other guy wants you to. By this measure, Rubio’s approach to Trump, as quoted above, should be considered tough. Indeed, his strategy has paid dividends, as Rubio has emerged as Trump’s most formidable rival.

Emoting Is No Substitute For Genuine Toughness

For the Left, by contrast, toughness is the antithesis of the rational and strategic. They take the Republicans for cowards for not renouncing Trump loudly enough. They aren’t tough enough to lead. “Tough,” for Clinton supporters, seems to reduce to something like an emotional heartfelt statement or action. The Right and Left thus have deeply conflicting views of toughness.

‘Tough,’ for Clinton supporters, seems to reduce to something like an emotional heartfelt statement or action.

Coming back to the Trump-Putin comparison, I think the Left’s truncated understanding of toughness provides a clue to its failed approach to foreign policy.

When Democrats hear Republicans saying we need to be tougher on Iran, ISIS, or Putin, they assume Republicans want to saddle up on their high horse and saunter unthinkingly into a war of righteous principle. That is what being tough means to the Left. (Exhibit A: the Left’s “tough” approach on gun control.) Being tough is mean. It is not who we are (unless we are being mean to Republicans).

That is perhaps why President Obama constantly assumed the only alternative to the Iran deal was an all-out war, although no one was calling for that. Or why he keeps saying he won’t launch another Iraq-style invasion to defeat ISIS, when no one is suggesting a U.S. presence near that size would be needed. His critics were telling him he needed to be tougher, and he equates toughness with emotion-driven overreaction.

Preening and Strategy Aren’t the Same Thing

In lieu of toughness, the Left substitutes moral preening, and moral preening substitutes for strategy. Obama seems to believe ISIS will inevitably fail just because it does not represent the true Muslim faith; because, as he puts it, “its ideology is bankrupt.” Over a year ago, he assured us ISIS would fail because “People like this ultimately fail, they fail because the future is won by those who build and not destroy.” So he sees no real need to apply the military force needed to stop the jihadists.

In lieu of toughness, the Left substitutes moral preening, and moral preening substitutes for strategy.

Instead he messages young Muslims on the true meaning of Islam and lectures Americans on the proper moral response we ought to have to Muslim-Americans and refugees. It is virtue, apparently, not things like military, political, or economic power, that determine the progress of history. This is wishful thinking. While morality and justice are certainly admirable objectives, the president seems to think they are a substitute for strategy.

Look also at Russia. When Russia seized Crimea, Obama simply let everyone know that Putin was on the wrong side of history, and announced that Putin’s land grab would prove costly for Russia. All there was to do from Obama’s perspective was to sit back and wait for history to serve Putin his comeuppance.

To be fair, in this instance, the administration at least implemented a sanctions regime to nudge history along a bit. But Putin hasn’t folded yet. In fact, he’s expanded his military’s reach into the Syrian theater, where he promptly bombed the fighters we had been training. At times like these it would be nice to have a strategy based on something a little more concrete than being on the right side of history.

Just Sit Back and Let History Do My Job

But Obama believes in the arc of history. It is a doctrine of faith that drives his foreign policy. It explains, I think, why he rejects American exceptionalism and leadership. Others fear that when America withdraws, dangerous power vacuums emerge. But President Obama seems to think that America needs to stand back and let history take over.

When America tries to be tough, the Left thinks it is just allowing emotional exuberance to get in the way of history’s march toward a better world.

Some action—even military action—might be needed around the margins, but certainly no tough action. It is history’s job, not America’s to be tough with our adversaries. When America tries to be tough, the Left thinks it is just allowing emotional exuberance to get in the way of history’s march toward a better world.

The Left confuses toughness with “tough talk” and bluster, and sees it as a virtue when engaging in partisan politics, but a vice when dealing with adversaries. Naturally, they would like to see the Republican candidates direct more of that sort of toughness at Trump. But for conservatives toughness has more to do with conviction and perseverance in attaining one’s goals. It is a virtue both home and abroad, and requires steadiness of mind, rather than reactionary impulses.

One probably cannot glean too much about what a candidate’s foreign policy will look like based on the way he or she conducts a presidential campaign. But it would certainly be a mistake to read passivity, no less “cowardice,” into the way Republicans are handling Trump.

"To Take Down Trump, You Must Attack Him Personally","Donald Trump isn’t going anywhere until someone attacks him personally, in a way so sharp-edged and relentless that the deflecting, dismissing, obfuscating and trivializing techniques that have so far served him improbably well stop working. It will require nothing less than a full-frontal assault on the Trump mythos, who he purports to be, the whole Trump mystique.

It will involve aggregating and dishing up every backroom deal, every tenant harassed, every questionable tax favor from a compliant politician, the eminent domain actions, all the bankruptcies, the racial discrimination charges, the bogus university, the pyramid scheme, the blustering and the posturing, the mob coziness, the unending go-to bullying stance, the taking credit, highlighting every community run roughshod over, even the cheating at golf, the immaturity, and the tax dodges masquerading as charitable contributions—all of it doggedly and, as must be the case with Trump, fearlessly.

Engaging in this process may not be pleasant or ennobling to contemplate, but once commenced it will chip away, chunk by chunk, and the moment Trump comes to believe that the vaunted Trump brand could be susceptible to being recast as an optical illusion, whether fairly so or not—and, truth be told, there’s reason to think it might be that, at least in some part—his instinct will be to protect it, and to do so he will find a graceful but speedy exit, slip-sliding off the stage like Bob Hope waving to the troops after a United Service Organizations roadshow, and that will be that.

It will be necessary to weather an initial tsunami of retaliation consisting of the kinds of accusations that have worked for him in the past: You don’t get it because you’re not a tycoon. You’re the entrenched establishment with an agenda to protect and therefore unworthy of an audience. My net worth says everything you need to know about me. The usual. The counter punches will be even more nakedly personal than the ones leveled at him, because, well, it’s what he does.

The Dirty Truth: Trump Can’t Be Trusted

Some say the details of the Trump hagiography don’t matter, that his policies may be up for discussion but his can-do bona fides are not—they are a given, unquestioned and unquestionable. They add that the foibles and quibbles have all been brought up in the past and they don’t stick; he’s a guy who knows how to get things done in a colossal way, and that’s all that counts, forget the other stuff.

His opponents will highlight not the breadth of his capabilities, but their narrowness, his success in one particular slice of the business sphere.

Yes, that’s what he would have you believe, and he has spent a career making it so; but if Trump gets the nomination, the Republican Party will be betting everything that the grand Trump legend—hammered together over decades of single-minded self-promotion by none other than Trump himself—will hold up against the kind of vicious, take-no-prisoners inquisition it has never been asked to withstand.

His opponents will highlight not the breadth of his capabilities, but their narrowness, his success in one particular slice of the business sphere. They will focus not on his agility or creativity, but on the formulaic nature of what he does, learned at his father’s knee, and how reliant it is on the cooperation of complicit politicians who cough up the taxpayer-funded abatements and financial guarantees that make it all work.

They will not allow him to brush off bankruptcy as a benign “tool,” pointing out that he used it as a weapon to fend off legitimate creditors who, in order to avoid being screwed completely are bullied into agreeing to be screwed somewhat less than completely.

Single-mindedly deployed, and persistently, no matter how energetic the attempt to derail it, with not even the slightest nod to fair play, the uncomfortable question will be clear and persistent: Why should Trump’s undeniable earning power—in one particular segment of the business world that leans mightily on a long list of rather troubling techniques and behaviors—be an indicator that he has the broader abilities required and the moral and ethical bone marrow to warrant serious consideration for the most powerful, important—and potentially dangerous—executive position on the planet?

Just Imagine the Available Attack Ads

It’s easy to envision an ad something like this: They go out and unearth just a few of the many times Trump has used lawyers as battering rams to intimidate, buffalo, or crush his opponents, like here, here, here, here, here, here, and here. They will find all kinds of sympathetic characters on the receiving end of this and play sad violins in the background.

Honest, fair-minded, and forthright themselves, Trump’s supporters view him as being refreshingly the same.

Finally, a voiceover: If this is the way Trump misuses the U.S. legal system, what do you think he’s going to do when he gets his hands on the U.S. military?

That’s one; there are a hundred more, and each aspect of Trump’s rough-and-tumble past will be deeply mined for golden sludge that can be balled up and hurled directly at his equally golden head.

Honest, fair-minded, and forthright themselves, Trump’s supporters view him as being refreshingly the same. They see him as Galahad, undaunted and unafraid as he gallops across the land on his white charger, slaying dragons on their behalf.

But what happens when an orchestrated, determined fusillade causes that image to gradually pixilate… then slowly resharpen into… The Artful Dodger, finagling advantage for himself at every opportunity, blessed, ultimately, with little more than a good line of patter and a genius for self-marketing that he has transformed into a cagily amassed mountain of gold? What happens if people start thinking maybe, just maybe, Trump is not who he professes to be, that maybe, just maybe, there’s trouble in River City?

You Can Bet Your Britches the Democrats Will

The only real question is whether someone will do it before it’s too late, which is to say before he gets the nomination and is delivered up to the Democratic oppo commandos, their tanks currently amassed and idling, who will use this exact technique to roll over him with the kind of steely-eyed brutality that doesn’t leave many pieces left to pick up. They will spend $1 billion (literally) personally destroying him completely, utterly, irredeemably, and forever, and they won’t do it by attacking his policies, they’ll do it by attacking him.

Truth takes a backseat to what you can make people believe, and that is a concept Trump knows a thing or two about.

They did it to Romney when they had nothing to work with, other than his putting a dog on the top of his car and having a binder full of women. With Trump, fair or unfair, there is an embarrassment of riches. Trump might well have an explanation for everything, but it won’t matter: Truth takes a backseat to what you can make people believe, and that is a concept Trump knows a thing or two about.

It explains, for example, his outsized, almost embarrassing obsession with poll numbers: They tell him not whether he is right, but whether he has done enough to make people think he’s right; not whether he’s actually qualified to be president, but whether he has done enough to cause people think he is. For Trump, it seems that perception out there is and always has been the only reality that matters, especially when you know how to turn it into riches.

Of course, Romney didn’t fight back, much to the exasperation of those counting on him. Trump most certainly will, and that in and of itself might form a very large part of his appeal—but it will be endless and increasingly ugly, maybe even Queeg-like, and ultimately Ronald Reagan was right: When you’re explaining, you’re losing.

It’s not pretty; it’s not nice; and this explanation takes no position on whether it would be a good idea or a bad idea, whether Trump would be a good president or a spectacularly ill-suited one. But for those who desire to see Trump neutralized, for whatever reasons, who deem his ouster a consummation devoutly to be wished, it is the only way to make it happen.

Attack Trump for Who He Is, Not Who His Supporters Are

The puzzlement is, why are they going about it completely the wrong way? Consider this: Yes, the problem is Trump—at least, according to all of his opponents, the hierarchy of the Republican Party, the condescending media, endlessly self-congratulatory “Progressives,” and just about everyone else, excepting of course the largest chunks of registered Republican voters.

The only solution is to get Trump to quit of his own accord, and that will happen when his brand—not his candidacy—is in serious jeopardy.

They don’t see him as a problem at all, and that’s why the wrong way to confront him—absolutely the wrong way—is to attack his “candidacy,” meaning his policies, positions, and ideas, and that is true for three reasons, each one worse than the next.

1. It doesn’t work, and anyone who can’t see that by now has a learning disability. The reasons don’t matter: It’s the way it is. Get over it. Move on.

2. Any attack on Trump’s policies, especially attacks that are vituperative, haughty, and nasty, are received by his supporters—correctly—as attacks in kind on them. If the Republican Party hopes to get them out to vote for anyone other than Trump, it ought to stop insulting them, right now if not sooner.

3. If an attack on his candidacy should start to work, it will only guarantee a catastrophic third-party spoiler run, notwithstanding any hot-dogging promises to the contrary Trump might have recently made. Does anyone doubt his advisers will whisper persuasively in his ear, “You know, you’re better off having a White House with a Democrat who’s grateful—maybe one who went to your wedding—than a Republican who’s annoyed…”?

The only solution is to get Trump to quit of his own accord, and that will happen when his brand—not his candidacy—is in serious jeopardy, and he comes to believe that he’s run the string as long and as far as it will go; that there is a lot more at stake, finally, than his mere candidacy. He will then find a way to make a triumphant exit, turning his attention, once again, to figuring out how to get people to pay him to put his name on golf courses that he has nothing to do with.

Pay the Piper Now or Later

If one needs to feel better about this nasty business, bear in mind that anyone who thinks Trump wouldn’t do the same thing to an opponent if he deemed it necessary hasn’t been paying attention. Again, repeated for emphasis: The thing to look squarely in the eye is that the Democrats will do it to him. (Pay me now or pay me later.)

Anyone who thinks Trump wouldn’t do the same thing to an opponent if he deemed it necessary hasn’t been paying attention.

There is little reason to doubt that Trump genuinely wants to make America great again, and a strong and plausible argument can be made that he should be left unmolested; that he is the best thing since sliced bread, the greatest hope for redemption that America has seen in decades, uniquely qualified and precisely positioned to provide exactly what the country needs.

Certainly, this is how he is viewed by his supporters, who appear to be decent, patriotic Americans who want the best for this country and all its inhabitants. They are good people undeserving of demonization.

But for those who feel his supporters are dangerously misguided and badly misreading Trump’s capabilities and intentions, who believe his nomination will spell disaster not seen since the days of Barry Goldwater, taking him down, moving him out, neutralizing him is deemed the single most desperately pressing imperative imaginable.

It’s a Dirty Job, But Someone Has to Do It

Yes, it will be the politics of personal destruction; the dirty little demon in the closet that has done so much to turn our political system into a cesspool of institutionalized mean-spiritedness. It’s an infection, true, and maybe someday another dynamic will take root, some kind of ceasefire, but, until then, it’s a good idea to accept the reality as it is, rather than as we might like it to be.

Maybe it’s true that the upside of Trump neutralizes the downside. We’ll see. We will definitely see.

At first it will be called sour grapes and unfair, and people will rush to his defense, claiming, well, of course the establishment wants him gone—they have everything to lose, so they smear him, the Golden Boy. If the effort to unravel the Trump folklore is as thin and weak-kneed as in the past, he will skate on it all once again.

More likely, a small crack in the dam will appear. Trump and his supporters will do their best to put fingers in the dyke, but eventually it will give way, and when that happens there will be the biggest political pile-on since… well, maybe ever.

Of course, perhaps the Trump legend is unassailable, or its ingredients beside the point. Maybe his supporters and a lot of other folks, too, simply won’t care, so long as they continue to believe he and he alone can do whatever it is they yearn for. Maybe it’s true that the upside of Trump neutralizes the downside. We’ll see. We will definitely see.

But if the Trump legend doesn’t hold up, if it plays out as described here, on the day Hillary raises her hand and takes the oath of office, a lot of people are going to be sitting around, shaking their heads, and saying, “What were we thinking? Why didn’t we bring these things up before they did?”

"In Europe, Muslim Extremists Turn To Sexual Terrorism","Europe has a big problem on its hands. On Sunday, Germany’s justice minister said a series of attacks across the country on New Year’s Eve appear to have been pre-planned. In downtown Cologne, about a thousand men of Arab and North African descent entered a square full of celebrators and proceeded to surround women, robbing and in many cases sexually assaulting them.

Police describe a horrifying scene of women running terrified and attackers aggressively pushing back police. So far, 170 women have come forward with complaints, three-fourths of which involve sexual assaults. Similar attacks from that night have been reported in Hamburg, Stuttgart, Frankfurt, and Düsseldorf.

It now appears that officials tried to cover up the attacks lest they stoke anti-immigrant sentiment. On Friday, Cologne’s police chief was fired because of his poor handling of the attacks in the first few days of the new year. Rather than face the reality that they have a problem with their Muslim population, city officials tried to sweep it under the rug.

Hiding Sexual Assault In the Name of Tolerance

How they thought they could conceal an attack of this scale and nature is difficult to say. Then again, they’re just following a rising European trend. Consider the Rotherham rape scandal last year in Britain, which revealed that police and social workers had for years been hiding what amounted to 1,400 gang rapes of young women and girls by men of Pakistani descent. Social workers and others claimed they were afraid to come forward for fear some would accuse them of racism and “Islamaphobia.”

Something similar is happening in Cologne. Mayor Henriette Reker was quick to come out and claim “there are no indications that this involved people who have sought shelter in Cologne as refugees.” On Friday, news broke that 18 of 31 identified suspects were confirmed asylum-seekers. German’s leaders rushed to insist this couldn’t possibly have anything to do with the recent migrant crisis, before knowing the facts.

This isn’t just a European habit. Recall the U.S. media’s initial knee-jerk denial of the motivations of the San Bernardino terrorists. But Europe is especially afraid to acknowledge it has a problem with its Muslim population, and its leaders are giving the impression they don’t take the problem seriously.

To prevent similar attacks during Carnival celebrations next month, Reker awkwardly proposed that city officials would work to explain Carnival to people from other cultures so they won’t be “confused” about “celebratory behavior in Cologne,” as if the New Year’s Eve attackers merely didn’t understand that sexual assault is an inappropriate way to “celebrate” and all that’s needed to uproot deeply held cultural norms is a little bit more information.

The Muslim World Has a Violence Against Women Problem

To date, only 18 of the approximately 1,000 attackers have been confirmed as asylum seekers. But what about the rest of them? They may have been second- or third-generation immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, which suggests these communities are not assimilating sufficiently into European society and are not adopting its most important cultural norms.

It’s often the second and third generation, not the first, that is most resistant to Western culture.

This bodes ill for European countries that have seen massive migration from Muslim-majority countries in recent years because it’s often the second and third generation, not the first, that is most resistant to Western culture. Pew data shows that Muslims in Europe are having children at a faster rate than non-Muslim Europeans, so this ought to be a real concern.

Of course we should be careful not to portray all Muslim men as violent and repressive toward women. However, it would be madness to ignore the pervasive and persistent trend in the Muslim world of treating women as unequal to men and being physically violent toward them.

Until recently, women in Morocco (the most progressive Muslim state) couldn’t travel without permission from their father or a male relative, and courts often forced rape victims to marry their rapist. Women in Morocco (including many of my own personal acquaintances) are habitually chased, harassed, and groped. Groping and sexual assault tend to happen when large crowds gather, like in Tahir Square during the Egyptian Arab Spring—and what happened across Germany on New Year’s Eve.

Even a liberal Moroccan Muslim public intellectual, Fatima Sadiqi, once said in a lecture that men and women are equal, but women belong in the home sphere while men belong in the public one. This is the mildest way to interpret Muslim cultural attitudes toward women.

But let’s assume that it’s the correct one, for the sake of argument. Is this an acceptable future for Germany, or for any part of Europe? Given the continent’s rapidly changing demographics, where it’s predicted that by 2050 10.2 percent of the population will be Muslim, this is a question Europeans must answer.

Assimilation Is Now a Life or Death Project

It seems German officials are not worried enough about the potential problems a huge influx of mostly male emigrants from Muslim majority countries may bring. We live in an age where suggesting migrants need to assimilate is seen as colonialist and anti-multicultural. Yet not expecting them to accept some of the core values of the country they would call home—like treating women with respect—invites violent outbursts like those on New Year’s Eve, or worse, terrorist attacks like those in November in Paris.

Not expecting immigrants to accept some of the core values of the country they would call home—like treating women with respect—invites violent outbursts.

Perhaps these mass sexual assaults will turn out to be more unsettling to Europeans even than terrorist attacks, because it isn’t just their security that’s being threatened, but their way of life. One police man reported he had never seen such a lack of regard for the police in 29 years on the job as among the assailants on New Year’s Eve in Cologne.

Yet it seems like no one in charge is really that concerned—or if they are, they’re too politically correct to come out and say it, much like some liberals in America are reluctant to put the words “Islam” and “terrorist” in the same sentence.

If Europe’s political leaders don’t adequately address these real and troubling concerns and convince voters they’re taking it seriously, they will have a rebellion on their hands. Ignoring these incidents in the name of “tolerance” will further fuel far-right nationalist movements and xenophobic rhetoric.

It’s easy to see how attacks like this one will become a useful talking point for the far right, a ready-made argument against immigration. It’s also easy to see how it could point back toward the kind of nationalism that Europe has tried so hard to leave behind.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/01/11/in-europe-muslim-extremists-turn-to-sexual-terrorism/,2016-01-11
The Specter Of Islam,"A specter is haunting Europe. The specter of Islam.

George W. Bush used to say that we had to fight the terrorists over there, in the Middle East, so we wouldn’t have to fight them here at home. A long period of relative security made that claim seem overblown, like a lame justification for interventionism. But it just might turn out that he was right, and that it is even more true for Europe than it is for us.

I was reminded of this reading about the curtailed New Year’s Eve celebrations in Paris.

About 60,000 police officers and troops were deployed across the country, and revelers said that made them feel safer. “The same troops who used to be in Mali, Chad, French Guyana or the Central African Republic are now ensuring the protection of French people,” said Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.

In Belgium, the New Year’s Eve festivities were canceled entirely.

In Brussels, 2016 was rung in without the customary fireworks display and downtown street party…. Earlier this week, Belgian authorities announced they had arrested two men suspected of planning to stage attacks in Brussels over the holidays…. On Thursday morning, forklifts and trucks removed generators and other equipment from the Place de Brouckere, the broad square in central Brussels where the fireworks show was supposed to happen.

In Paris, they were significantly scaled down.

Paris canceled its usual fireworks display in favor of a five-minute video performance at the Arc de Triomphe just before midnight, relayed on screens along the Champs Elysee, where people chanted. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the show was aimed at “sending the world the message that Paris is standing, proud of its lifestyle and living together.”

Well, no, if Paris were standing tall, it would have had its usual celebrations. Fireworks have an interesting symbolism, recalling the sights and sounds of war. Presumably that’s the problem this year: fireworks would be good cover for another shooting rampage. In the United States, legend has it that the reason we have fireworks on the Fourth of July is to remember the wars we fought to gain and keep our independence — the rockets’ red glare, the bombs bursting in air. But you only want to remember that if you won the war. If you’re losing, I can see why you wouldn’t be so excited about the fireworks.

The most dispiriting thing said about Paris was from a Parisienne on the street: “It was a very strange year, and we just want 2016 to be different, simply a normal one. It does not need to be an excellent one, but just a normal one.” Way to aim high.

I doubt 2016 is going to be a ‘normal’ year for Europeans.

But I doubt 2016 is going to be a normal year for Europeans. German officials just admitted that a little more than half of a wave of attacks during New Year’s Eve celebrations in Cologne were by North African and Middle Eastern asylum seekers who have flooded into the country during the Syrian civil war and have been welcomed under a foolishly, sanctimoniously overgenerous refugee policy.

The most disturbing thing about the Cologne attacks was the prevalence of sexual assault as a weapon, complete with gangs of Muslim men stalking German women through the streets, yelling obscenities at them and threatening them with sexual violence. Note to Western feminists: we finally found real “rape culture” for you. Unfortunately, it is not found primarily among middle-class American college boys, which is what you were hoping for.

This is “normal” — if that word can be applied here — in the Arab and Muslim world. Wherever large crowds gather, unaccompanied women are in danger. (Remember the brutal attack on CBS reporter Lara Logan during the Egyptian revolution.) This is a measure of the extent to which the culture of Islam, as it is practiced in much of the world, deranges and brutalizes its believers, particularly when it comes to their attitudes toward women and sex. This is what has now arrived in the heart of a free, civilized, enlightened Europe.

But take heart, some people in Europe are really thinking ahead. The famed Italian fashion house Dolce & Gabbana in now offering high-end hijabs. So yes, it turns out that burqas do come in sizes.

This is an inauspicious start to 2016 — but it is exactly what we should expect after 2015, which was the year the Specter of Islam rose to loom high over the capitals of Europe.

2015 was the year the Specter of Islam rose to loom over the capitals of Europe.

Last year was bookended by parallel events in France and the United States. The year began with the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris, in which French jihadists with ties to ISIS wiped out the top staff of an irreverent magazine that had flouted Islamic restrictions — followed in March by the thwarted attack on Pamela Geller’s Draw Mohammed contest in Garland, Texas. The year drew to an end with a large, coordinated jihadist shooting attack on multiple targets across Paris, followed by the San Bernardino massacre in the US.

In these attacks, we can see three clear patterns.

First, radical Muslims attack the mind first, then the body. In a revealing statement, Secretary of State John Kerry blurted out that he found the Charlie Hebdo attacks understandable, with a “legitimacy” or at least a “rationale” about enforcing Islamic restrictions. But that’s an utterly false distinction. Yes, the jihadists’ first targets in the West are going to be those people who use words, ideas, and art to challenge Islam. But those are only the first targets, not the last. As the attacks at the end of the year demonstrated, the jihadists ultimately want to wipe out all the infidels, not just the outspoken few. And as the New Year’s Eve attacks demonstrate, their target isn’t just artists who draw provocative cartoons but women whose “provocation” is not to cover themselves in public from head to foot.

Europe is the front line, but we’re not far behind.

Second, the attacks in the US are smaller, less organized, and less successful than in Europe. This reflects the fact that Muslims in the US is a smaller percentage of the population and better assimilated to American values. Fewer are attracted to the cause of jihad, and they are less able to work with people around them to plan and organize. (And, as I noted after the Garland attack, America is generally a harder target.) But among the small number of violent radicals, the full murderous intent is there, even if the means are not as effective. Europe is the front line, but we’re not far behind.

This can be seen in the first Islam-inspired terror attack of the New Year: the shooting of a Philadelphia police officer by a man who pledged loyalty to ISIS and said he did it “in the name of Islam.” He will no doubt be dismissed as No True Muslim.

And that leads us to the third lesson: we have a president who is resolutely opposed to learning any of the other lessons. Instead, he is focusing all of his efforts on doing what little he can to disarm Americans. Unfortunately, judging from the presidential debates — in which the Democratic participants steadfastly refused to use the phrase “radical Islam” — we’re not going to get any better from the next round of Democratic candidates.

The rise of the Islamic State and its ability to inspire and organize terrorists attacks in the West, combined with the Democrats’ refusal to confront this threat, sets up one of the big questions for 2016, particularly as the Republican primaries actually go to a vote in the next two months. This must now be a national security election, and by that standard the only interesting debate is between Republican candidates Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz.

I don’t expect our current president to do much of anything about the threat of Islam, or to help the Europeans with it, during his remaining term in office. Instead, we have the rest of this year to decide how we would like the next president to deal with it.

Because the specter of Islam is haunting us all.

6 Things We Learned From Last Night’s Republican Debate,"The Republicans held their sixth primary debate last night. With at least one notable exception — which was kind of awesome in its own dreadful way — these have been good debates, and we’ve learned something new from each one. Here’s what we learned from last night’s Republican debate.

1) Smaller Debates Are Better

And then there were seven.

Fading candidates Carly Fiorina and Rand Paul have been knocked off the stage, and the results are an improvement. With fewer people on stage, there was more time for each candidate to talk, and more extended back and forth among the top candidates. It was more of a debate and less of an exercise in crowd control.

It also helps that after a few more months of debates and campaigning, most of them have gotten better as candidates. Even, I hate to admit, Donald Trump. Not that I like him any better, but he mostly managed not to sound inarticulate and totally uninformed. Mostly.

But not everyone has improved.

2) There Are Still Too Many People on Stage

In the first round of responses, most of the candidates gave you an idea of why they were up there and the reason for their appeal. Even John Kasich gave a good answer about the policy formula for creating a growing economy.

But two candidates didn’t: Jeb Bush and Ben Carson.

Jeb’s deeper problem is that he didn’t have anything distinctive to say or any distinctive way of saying it.

Carson was too low-key, which is his big problem. It’s part of the reason he tended to get lost during the evening, though it prompted the funniest line of the night. After Jeb managed to plead for a minute of airtime by pointing out that he was mentioned in a previous exchange, Carson followed with: “Neil, I was mentioned, too.” “You were?” “Yeah, he said ‘everybody.'”

But back to Jeb. (See? This is what it’s like for Carson these days. He gets a mention, but then we move on to somebody else.) Bush’s problem is partly that he seems a bit deflated and dispirited. He was supposed to be the Establishment candidate whose name recognition and big campaign money made him the presumptive nominee. But he keeps getting humiliated by Trump and outclassed by his young, former protégé Marco Rubio, and he just keeps fading in the polls. It looks to me like that’s taking its psychological toll, like he has lost his confidence.

But Jeb’s deeper problem is that he didn’t have anything distinctive to say or any distinctive way of saying it. His opening statement wasn’t bad, but everything in it was said better by somebody else.

At this point, there is nothing Jeb Bush is contributing to the contest — except for a runaway super-PAC that’s running negative ads against better candidates. It’s time to end it.

3) The Detente Between Trump and Cruz Is Over

At the last debate, Trump and Cruz ended up in a cozy little lovefest. This time, as Trump summed it up after the debate, “the bromance is over.”

Both of them should probably wish it weren’t. Take the “New York values” exchange. Cruz clearly got the better of the exchange at first, bringing up one of Trump’s old interviews in which he described his socially liberal views and attributed them to his New York background. But then Trump countered with a personal, heartfelt story about 9/11 and the way the nation rallied behind New Yorkers after those attacks. I’m no Trump fan, but I found it moving and totally sincere. It made Cruz look small, and he had no response.

That’s the risk for these two candidates: mutually assured destruction. Cruz is a very skilled speaker who deftly wields the weapon of sarcasm. He is cutting and effective and can make his attacks on Trump stick, which hardly anybody else can do. But Trump can hurt Cruz in return, and in a way that undermines his whole campaign strategy. Cruz has been sidling up to Trump in the hope of winning over his supporters when Trump drops out. But if Trump is now poisoning his supporters against Cruz, particularly with the birther attack, then Cruz’s strategy was a waste of time. All it accomplished was to alienate people like me, who were disappointed in Cruz for not standing firm against Trumpism.

4) You’re Not Going to Beat Ted Cruz on Negative Attacks

I think Cruz lost the “New York Values” exchange, but that was the exception. He shot down a question on a New York Times hit piece about a campaign loan, and he totally took Trump to the woodshed on the birther issue. Unlike Jeb, Cruz can tangle with Trump and end up looking like the dominant figure in the exchange.

The lesson for the other candidates is that you’re not going to take down Cruz with a negative attack, so don’t even try it. He can take these attacks, beat them down, and turn them back against you.

This is a real dilemma for the other candidates. But I can suggest that there is one way you can turn Cruz’s strength into a weakness. Turn his unflappability and self-possession against him. Make him seem too practiced and theatrical. Make him seem glib, slick, and insincere. This is Cruz’s one big actual weakness. He has a tendency toward sloganeering, and while he always comes into a debate prepared, he can be overly rehearsed, which makes him seem artificial.

And there’s one person in the race who might be able to exploit that.

5) Rubio Has Sincerity, and If You Can Fake That…

Cruz’s strength is his smoothness as an extemporaneous speaker. Rubio’s strength is that he doesn’t just sound like he can talk about the issues. He sounds like he’s doing it in an unpracticed way, speaking frankly and from the heart.

Is this actually true? Well, he is a politician, and you know the old saying. Sincerity is the big thing, and if you can fake that, you’ve got it made. So I presume there is some calculation behind Rubio’s manner, too. One thing I’ve noticed that’s new is that Rubio is really managing to muster a sense of outrage about the current state of the country, which is intended to appeal to some of the Trump-Cruz demographic. Yet somehow Rubio manages to do it without seeming angry, mean, or blustering.

6) We Can See How Rubio Starts to Break Out

Rubio is young, charismatic, intelligent, and sincere. But he’s had a hard time breaking out, particularly in a crowded field with the Trump Media Death Star sucking up all the oxygen. You could see in this debate how he could finally begin to do that.

The signature exchange of the debate was the Trump versus Cruz cage match on the birther issue.

First, he was one of the strongest candidates when questions turned to free-market economics, with his answers on tariffs and the VAT. There are still a lot of voters like me, for whom the free market (and not, say, immigration) is the top issue. And he really drove home a point late in the debate about how Cruz has changed his positions over the years, and that is the big weakness for a candidate who has positioned himself as more-principled-than-thou.

Rubio’s style and his discipline in always focusing on a wider message are paying off. And judging from the audience reaction, they like him in South Carolina. This could turn out to be really important for his strategy, which involves placing a decent second or third place in Iowa and New Hampshire and then breaking out later. If he’s going to do that, South Carolina would be a good place to break out.

The signature exchange of the debate, in my view, was the Trump versus Cruz cage match on the birther issue. If you watch just one thing from the debate, watch that exchange. And note how Rubio comes in at the end, on some thin pretext about his name being dropped, and just steals the exchange by talking with personal passion about how focused he is on the real issues. Here is the transcript of that section of the debate. I’ve left out the first half of the birther exchange, though the whole thing is worth watching, and I’ve cut out a little of the crosstalk to make it easier to follow.

TRUMP: The fact is, there is a big overhang. There’s a big question mark on your head. And you can’t do that to the party. You really can’t. You can’t do that to the party. You have to have certainty. Even if it was a one percent chance, and it’s far greater than one percent…. I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can’t run. If there was a — and you know I’m not bringing a suit. I promise. But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty. You can’t have a question. I can agree with you or not, but you can’t have a question over your head. CAVUTO: Senator, do you want to respond? CRUZ: Well, listen, I’ve spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the US Supreme Court. And I’ll tell you, I’m not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump. The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero. And Mr. Trump is very focused on Larry Tribe. Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is. He’s a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore’s lawyer in Bush versus Gore. He’s a major Hillary Clinton supporter. And there’s a reason why Hillary’s supporters are echoing Donald’s attacks on me, because Hillary wants to face Donald Trump in the general election. And I’ll tell you what, Donald, you — you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the VP slot. (Laughter.) I’ll tell you what. If this all works out, I’m happy to consider naming you as VP. So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day. TRUMP: No — no…I think if it doesn’t… I like that. I like it. I’d consider it. But I think I’ll go back to building buildings if it doesn’t work out. CRUZ: Actually, I’d love to get you to build a wall. TRUMP: I have a feeling it’s going to work out, actually. RUBIO: I was invoked in that question, so let me just say — in that answer — let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV. (Laughter.) But the real — but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about, OK? Listen, we — this is the greatest country in the history of mankind. But in 2008, we elected a president that didn’t want to fix America. He wants to change America. We elected a president that doesn’t believe in the Constitution. He undermines it. We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage. We elected a president that doesn’t believe in the free enterprise system. This election has to be about reversing all of that damage. That’s why I’m running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders. When I’m president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military. And when I’m president, we’re not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world. When I’m president, we’re going to have a president that acts like it.

That, in about three minutes, was the essence of last night’s debate.

"Tunisians, Who Started The Arab Spring, Are At It Again","Once again Tunisia, the country that launched the Arab Spring, is seeing uncertain days. People have taken to the streets across the country protesting high unemployment and poverty, sometimes violently. Much like in 2011, they are demanding immediate action from the government. One man set himself on fire, an echo of Mohamed Bouazizi, whose self-immolation in 2010 sparked the protests in Tunisia that toppled Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali and led to the Arab Spring.

But what do these new protests mean five years later amid a much more unstable and dangerous Middle East? And how is ISIS taking advantage of the situation?

Some speculate that this recent unrest is unlikely to lead to a call to overthrow the government, because Tunisians supposedly aren’t looking for a revolution. This time it’s just about economic concerns.

But it’s important to remember that, although also about political freedom and authoritarian rule, the revolt in 2011 was also largely about unemployment and poor living conditions in the face of government corruption. Ben Ali and other political elites were known to be living in luxury while the Tunisian people languished. Economic woes very well could spark a revolt for a people who have proven themselves very comfortable with civil disobedience.

We Want a Stable Society to Materialize Overnight

Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid pleaded with the Tunisian people to be understanding that the transition to democracy takes time and that “solutions exist but some patience and optimism are needed.” Patient is just what the people are not. As Al Jazeera reports, they are demanding “immediate” relief of unemployment and “poor economic conditions.”

Tunisians have yet to understand that replacing the regime and opening the country to elections isn’t a cure for economic woes—or corruption.

This is a sign the Tunisian people haven’t internalized much of what it means to live in a free society. Since the Arab Spring, Tunisia has enjoyed the fruits of its rebellion, such as open elections. But changing the economy takes time. Tunisians have yet to understand that replacing the regime and opening the country to elections isn’t a cure for economic woes—or corruption.

To make matters worse, in the last few months, the parliament has seen mass resignations from the ruling secular party, Nida Tounes, in protest of the president’s son being appointed party chief. This has led to Tunisia’s moderate Islamist party, Ennahda, gaining the majority in parliament.

The unrest and impatience of the Tunisian people, plus the parliamentary upheaval, could expose the country to threats that didn’t exist in 2011—namely, ISIS. Essid warned that “dirty hands” are provoking and encouraging these demonstrations. As the protests spread and an indefinite nationwide curfew is put into place, leaders worry that radical elements are taking advantage of the anger Tunisians are feeling toward their government. Unfortunately, this is not just speculation or a distraction from the legitimate economic protests. It’s a real threat.

ISIS Seeks to Move In

On Thursday, ISIS released several videos calling on Tunisians, Moroccans, Algerians, Malians, and Libyans to join in an effort to overthrow the “apostate” governments of Tunisia and Morocco. ISIS is accusing these two countries, who have retained close ties to France, of trying to “westernize” Muslims in the face of their Islamic traditions. They are calling for an Islamic regime to be put into place and the reinstatement of Sharia law.

One video encourages Moroccans and Tunisians to rise up and launch Paris-style attacks in their respective countries.

One video encourages Moroccans and Tunisians to rise up and launch Paris-style attacks in their respective countries. The jihadist in the video points out how much easier an attack of this nature would be to execute in North Africa than in a European city. And he’s right.

Unfortunately, Tunisia is no stranger to terrorist attacks in recent months. In 2015, Islamist terrorists struck the country on three separate occasions. First was the shooting at the Bardo Museum in Tunis, where 21 were killed, primarily European tourists. Next, a gunman killed 38 tourists, mostly British, at a beachside resort in Sousse. In both instances, the attackers are thought to have trained in Libya and ISIS claimed responsibility. These two attacks were clearly aimed at the Western culture that runs throughout these Muslim-majority countries.

In November, however, an attack of a different nature took place. A suicide bomber targeted the Tunisian presidential guard, killing 12. Rather than explicitly attacking a Western hot spot, this attack was aimed at the government. More than just going for anti-western symbolism, ISIS is serious about spreading its influence and control into the Maghreb. It doesn’t mean merely to menace the state; it means to undermine it.

ISIS already has a strong foothold in Libya, which collapsed into chaos after the ousting of Muammar Gaddafi. They are poised to extend their influence into the Maghreb, just a stone’s throw from Europe.

Tunisia Could Become an ISIS Launch Pad

Although it might seem like these attacks couldn’t bring down the country, the president of Tunisia is aware of the danger they pose. After the Sousse attacks, he warned that another such event would “cause the country to collapse.” If the Arab Spring proved anything, it’s that the will of the people can topple a government. The power vacuum this leaves can be volatile—and violent, as it was in Libya.

There is little doubt that ISIS can destabilize the country.

Regardless of whether the takeover of Tunisia is actually feasible, there is little doubt that ISIS can destabilize the country. This could in turn allow it to become a harbor for ISIS and other Islamist groups and a launching pad for further attacks on the European continent.

However, ISIS isn’t just trying to extend its territory into North Africa. The Islamic State has long found Tunisia to be a fruitful recruiting ground—and not just for launching attacks at home. ISIS boasts more foreign fighters from Tunisia than from any other country.

It’s a grim reality to find that the one supposed success story of the Arab Spring should be home to so many ISIS supporters. This demonstrates that just because a country has had a democratic revolution doesn’t mean that everyone in the country embraces it.

Victimhood Breeds Violence

The Tunisian people need to be patient and understand that the transition from an authoritarian regime to a democracy will take time, if it’s even possible. Just like many Americans, Tunisians are under the false impression that the government can just create jobs for them.

The ‘success story’ of the Arab Spring is showing signs of how tentative that achievement was.

If the Tunisian people cannot patiently wait out these transitional years while demanding transparency from their government, they will find themselves in a constant state of political upheaval. This shaky state of affairs will make them vulnerable not just to ISIS, but also to the Islamist parties from within who may promise jobs in exchange for religious concessions.

The “success story” of the Arab Spring is showing signs of how tentative that achievement was. The ousting of Ben Ali and his corrupt government was an important start. But that was only one battle in the war.

The real challenges are to instill democratic principles in a people that have known only authoritarian governance, and to root out the alarming number of ISIS supporters in this Western-leaning country. Whether these two things are possible remains to be seen. In the meantime, Tunisia is exposed and vulnerable, to enemies both foreign and domestic.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/01/26/the-country-that-started-the-arab-spring-is-at-it-again/,2016-01-26
Why Mass Muslim Migration Eviscerates Western Liberalism,"For the past few months, the question of admitting tens of thousands of Syrian refugees has rocked the American political landscape, and predictably the issue has been remarkably polarized. Many on the Left, including both Democratic presidential candidates, have advocated for a massive domestic resettlement effort, while those on the Right favor either granting asylum only to Christian refugees or admitting no refugees.

On February 3, Congress joined in the debate through a public hearing hosted by the Senate’s Homeland Security Committee. The hearing, which analyzed Canada’s plans to screen and admit 25,000 Syrian refugees, invoked the testimony of both Canadian and U.S. experts, including U.S. border officials. This scrutiny of our northern neighbor’s refugee plans is evidently Congress’s attempt to check for flaws in the Canadian system (which could result in potentially violent migrants living dangerously close to the United States) and to better understand whether the Obama administration’s vetting program will be effective.

The Senate’s hearing comes hot on the heels of terrorist acts perpetrated by Middle Eastern immigrants across the globe, which have seriously complicated the conversation on Syrian refugees. Last month, for instance, an Islamic State operative from Syria killed 10 Western tourists through a suicide bombing in Turkey, and on New Year’s Eve a group of 1,000 confirmed Arab and North African asylum-seekers robbed and sexually assaulted literally hundreds of women in Cologne, Germany. Even in the United States, the federal government recently arrested two Iraqi-born refugees, in Sacramento and Houston, for plotting with terror groups and lying about their activity.

As the hearing demonstrated, the controversy surrounding refugees in America has focused almost entirely on the potential threat to national security, and the possibility—or probability, rather—of ISIS capitalizing on open borders to plant insurgents into the country.

While these points are undoubtedly legitimate and signify cause for concern, the potential cultural implications of a large-scale Muslim migration into the United States have, on the whole, been relegated to the sidelines of the national conversation. This part of the discussion is equally important, however, because it exposes how open borders are quite contrary to liberal Americans’ own values and interests.

A Culture Antithetical to American Values

According to available statistics, the vast majority of Syrian refugees that have been admitted to the United States since 2011 are Muslim, and given the fact that only about 10 percent of all global refugees are Christian, it’s safe to infer that the majority of refugees settling in other parts of the globe are also Muslim.

Many liberals have apparently forgotten how marginalized groups are treated in the majority-Muslim countries of the Middle East.

In their rush to appear as compassionate champions of Syrian refugees, many liberals have apparently forgotten how marginalized groups are treated in the majority-Muslim countries of the Middle East. According to a report by the World Health Organization in 2013, rates of domestic violence are the highest by far in the Muslim countries of North Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.

It’s only been within the past 15 to 20 years that women have gained access to political rights and offices in some of these countries, yet despite this, women are still openly harassed in public, completely undermined by many of their states’ legal systems, and severely restricted from basic civil rights, particularly the freedoms of choice and expression. Incredibly, it’s still not uncommon for young women to be forced to marry someone who rapes or assaults them—a reality that stems from regional religious and cultural views of honor.

Gays have it even worse than women. Homosexual behavior and LGBT expression is either illegal or severely restricted in all countries of the Middle East besides Israel, and punishments include lifelong imprisonment or execution. Indeed, Israel is the only country in the region that recognizes same-sex marriage, provides for adoption by same-sex couples, and allows gays to serve in the military. As for transgender individuals, the Left’s darling new minority group? Only Israel, Iran, and Syria provide legal recognition for changes in gender identity.

Is it really the progressive thing to do to grant indefinite sanctuary to individuals who are committed to such fundamentally different ways of life?

Recent events in Europe show that incoming refugees are not so quick to abandon their native cultural attitudes. Last month, gay refugees in the Netherlands had to be moved to separate facilities after other refugees attacked them, and across Europe facilities are being built specifically for LGBT refugees because of at least a hundred reports of assault.

The Cologne attacks clearly demonstrate that many refugees have no qualms assaulting and robbing women, and several other European countries have been dealing with a spike in rapes in migrant-heavy areas for the past several years. This has lead some, like Norway, to institute classes at asylum centers teaching refugees how to treat women properly.

While this may help prevent further attacks, it likely won’t be that easy for refugees to conform to Western cultural standards so quickly. After all, many have grown up in extremely patriarchal societies where any scantily clad woman is understood to be a prostitute and even the slightest display of skin is taken as an invitation for sex.

Is it really the progressive thing to do to grant indefinite sanctuary to individuals who are committed to such fundamentally different ways of life? This is a question that liberals—especially women and gays—should ask themselves before jumping into the open border abyss.

A Potential Long-Term Problem

Presented with this mounting evidence, some on the Left have attempted to negate concerns that Europe’s refugee problems will manifest in America, arguing that the overseas case is different because their incoming refugees are overwhelmingly young men, a demographic naturally prone to such violent behavior. They further point out that the United Nations has said it plans to direct mostly women and children across the Atlantic, and that the Obama administration has sworn the government’s vetting process will grant preference to these ostensibly less-threatening refugees.

Liberals are creating an environment for deadly anti-American sentiment to fester when they encourage migrants to simultaneously preserve their native culture and abhor their new American one.

While women and children do make up a large portion of the potential refugees to the United States, no one can say for certain that young men or potential ISIS insurgents will not get past government screening. But let’s say for a moment that, unlike most things run by the government, the vetting system is actually effective and does bar potentially disruptive refugees, allowing only the harmless women and children as Obama promised. Would this situation leave liberals with no cause for concern?

Peter Skerry at The Weekly Standard offers insightful information about the nature of Muslim immigration and assimilation that suggest otherwise. He explains that, generally, immigrant parents reconcile with what’s known as “the brutal bargain.” They reluctantly come to terms with what they lost in leaving their homeland by comparing their past circumstances to their newer, better prospects in America.

Moreover, while Muslims are remarkably assimilated in some respects—most speak English, earn a decent living, and attend American schools—a notable shift occurs as the second generation comes of age. This generation likely grows up seeing their parents deal with the realities of the bargain. For example, first-generation parents might acquiesce to American social norms in the public sphere, grateful to be making a decent living in a safe environment, but at home they’ll express intense disapproval of American culture—especially youth culture—even if they aren’t particularly observant Muslims.

Skerry explains that their children, whose only real home has been the United States, may inherit their parents’ cultural disapproval but lack the same sense of obligatory appreciation that led their parents to assimilate. Thus, when it comes to assimilation, they may “[try] self-consciously to apply the brakes, even to reverse the process in order to regain what many feel has been lost.”

Children whose only real home has been the United States may inherit their parents’ cultural disapproval but lack the same sense of obligatory appreciation.

What’s more is that today’s liberals—who control most of education, including the public schools and colleges these immigrant children eventually attend—relentlessly teach immigrants and minority groups that they’re perpetual victims of a racist American society, and that they should hate the governing system that granted their ancestors protection.

Indeed, many on the Left have completely abandoned assimilation, which they regard only as a synonym for “racism,” “xenophobia,” and “white supremacy,” while worshipping their religions of multiculturalism, diversity, and tolerance. It’s likely because of the global Left’s obsessive, coercive commitment to these principles that German police attempted to cover up the sexual assault epidemic—something authorities in other European nations have also been doing—to protect refugees from any perceived “discrimination.”

While there may be no apparent threat in admitting fleeing Muslim families to the United States, liberals are creating an environment for potentially deadly anti-American sentiment to fester when they encourage migrants to simultaneously preserve their native culture and abhor their new American one.

ISIS and other terror groups have already proven their digital arms extend across the Atlantic and into the United States. The San Bernardino shooters, for instance, long-time residents in the United States who became radicalized domestically, as evidenced by their communication with overseas terror groups prior to the massacre. Who’s to say ISIS or another terror organization won’t similarly manipulate future Muslim-Americans?

Open Borders Lead to a Culture of Fear

You’ll recall that the media absolutely lost its collective mind when Donald Trump suggested a temporary ban on Muslim immigration in response to the Paris attacks. You couldn’t go to any news outlet without seeing Trump’s name in top headlines. Yet despite all the attacks and accusations of Republican xenophobia most mainstream media outlets launched, Trump’s lead in the polls only expanded after his suggested ban, proving that a good chunk of Americans actually liked the sound of his policy.

We know that liberals’ unequivocal support for open borders and unfiltered immigration on a massive scale only increases ‘xenophobic’ sentiment among Americans.

Liberals are right when they say that closing our borders to refugees in desperate need of help is inconsistent with our American (and Judeo-Christian inspired) values. They are also right when they argue that increasing surveillance on American Muslims and letting in some refugees over others—based on religion, perhaps—is discriminatory and inconsistent with constitutional principles.

But as the Wall Street Journal correctly notes, sometimes it’s in our national interest to “accept small infringements on liberty” such as these, because “the consequences of failure will be so much worse for liberal values” and for the nation as a whole. Keeping out certain demographics of immigrants as a temporary policy solution might certainly be worth it if the wrong handful of individuals gain access into the country and commit a Paris-style terror attack.

If you have trouble imagining the restrictions placed on the personal liberties of all Americans that would likely follow such an event, think back to the Patriot Act and the post-9/11 paranoia. Or, even more extreme, think of the Japanese internment camps during World War II, which were an egregious violation of civil rights that grew out of the fear instilled by Pearl Harbor.

In any case, we know that liberals’ unequivocal support for open borders and unfiltered immigration on a massive scale only increases “xenophobic” sentiment among Americans. We’ve already seen some lawmakers move further down that path as a consequence of the massive amounts of Hispanic aliens who have entered the country and not assimilated particularly well. Adopting the same unwavering stance for Muslim migration would only compound the polarized political landscape, reducing the chances of the United States providing assistance for any refugees.

It’s certainly tempting to sift through heart-wrenching pictures of starved Syrian children and passionately condemn those opposed to their immediate entry as heartless, nonsensical, and even monstrous. But liberals shouldn’t let their commitment to compassion blind them to the potential consequences of mass Muslim migration—consequences that would utterly contradict their own interests and beliefs. If they don’t lift the veil, they’ll fail to realize that the most compassionate thing to do isn’t to open the border, but rather to focus their efforts on eliminating the evil that’s pushing the refugees out of their homeland in the first place.

Correction: The classes for refugees in Norway were voluntary, not mandatory. And one of the San Bernardino shooters was born outside the United States. We regret the errors.

Rethinking Richard Nixon,"What does it take to get the public to reassess the life and legacy of a president?

It’s a question worth pondering in an age where media narratives and groupthink define perceptions and strain to write history in real time. However, when it comes to polarizing public figures, often we find that what think we know about someone is at odds with the facts.

Case in point: Of all the political leaders of his generation, the historical consensus about Richard Nixon remains the most divided and contentious. But despite the attention historians and journalists have focused on Nixon —most of it negative—there has been less true historical scholarship than one would expect, and more casual repetition of anecdotes, clichés, and conventional wisdom.

In The President and the Apprentice: Eisenhower and Nixon, 1952-1961, historian Irwin F. Gellman seeks to fill that void, and does so in a readable and extensively researched volume. Focusing on the eight years Nixon spent as Dwight D. Eisenhower’s vice president, Gellman explores the relationship between the two men while rebutting much of the erroneous folk wisdom that has been repeated through the years about Nixon’s role in the administration.

This explicitly revisionist history, which follows Gellman’s 1999 volume, The Contender: Richard Nixon: The Congress Years, 1946-1952, is the result of the author’s twenty years of study in the National Archives, the Nixon library, the Eisenhower library, and other repositories of historical documents. The contrast with earlier historians’ efforts, many of them written without use of these primary sources, is startling. The President and the Apprentice should shift the historical assessment of Nixon’s vice presidency considerably.

Collateral Damage

After Eisenhower’s victory over Senator Robert Taft at the 1952 Republican National Convention, Nixon’s name was at the top of his list to join him on the ticket, and the party’s power-brokers agreed. The campaign that followed resonates with our own times. The incumbent president, Democrat Harry S. Truman, and his party’s nominee to succeed him, Illinois Gov. Adlai Stevenson, dismissed the threat of communism, even after losing China to red revolution; similarly, our own president and his would-be Democratic successors downplay the danger of radical jihadists, despite having lost much of Syria and Iraq to an apocalyptic caliphate. (In other places, the analogy is woefully inapposite: The Republicans of 1952 had Eisenhower, the general who led the free world to victory over fascism. We have Donald Trump.)

Eisenhower approached politics as a general; some collateral damage was acceptable where it did not endanger the overall effort.

The pivotal event in the 1952 campaign was controversy over a fund Nixon’s backers set up to help defray his expenses while in the Senate. Such funds were common and legal, and Nixon’s was not kept secret (as Stevenson’s much larger fund was), but talk of a “slush fund” detracted from the Republicans’ message of cleaning up corruption in government. Nixon addressed the nation to explain his financial affairs in what came to be known as his famous “Checkers Speech.”

Eisenhower did not immediately spring to Nixon’s defense, but waited to see how the situation would develop. To Nixon, this signaled hesitancy from Eisenhower about Nixon’s fitness for office, and that theme is the one popular historians have most often repeated ever since. In truth, as Gellman demonstrates, Ike’s behavior was more indicative of the difference in style between the two men.

Nixon’s career was that of a partisan politician, and he expected that a Republican would defend another vigorously against every Democratic attack. Eisenhower approached politics as a nonpartisan and with the outlook of a general; some collateral damage was acceptable where it did not endanger the overall effort. He observed Nixon’s efforts, assessed the overwhelmingly positive popular response to the speech, and moved on with the campaign, publicly praising his running mate’s courage in a tense situation.

The Mentor and the Protégé

As the book’s title suggests, the president and vice president who entered office in 1953 after their landslide victory were not equal partners. Eisenhower, the victorious commander of the Second World War, had no equal. While he consulted his cabinet and advisers as necessary, no one in the administration doubted that Ike set the policy. But neither was his vice president a useless appendage.

No one in the administration doubted that Ike set the policy. But neither was his vice president a useless appendage.

Eisenhower had been deeply disturbed in 1945 when, after Franklin Roosevelt’s death, Vice President Truman ascended to the presidency with little knowledge of his predecessor’s most important policies and aims. He was also mindful that his age, sixty-two, placed him among the oldest presidents ever to take office. (Not, however, the oldest, as Gellman erroneously states. William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, and James Buchanan were all older than Eisenhower at their inaugurations.) With this in mind, Eisenhower resolved to involve Nixon in all of the administration’s major initiatives.

The result was a mentor-protégé relationship, especially in the foreign affairs arena. Eisenhower involved Nixon in cabinet and National Security Council discussions, even tasking the vice president with chairing cabinet meetings in his absence, which was unprecedented in American history. In 1954, Nixon addressed the nation on television to explain the administration’s “New Look” policy, which balanced military preparedness and a growing nuclear deterrent force with fiscal solvency and a return to a peacetime economy after the disruptions of the Korean War.

Eisenhower also dispatched Nixon around the globe, not just on the funeral and coronation circuit expected of vice presidents, but on true fact-finding and diplomatic consultation missions to Asia, Africa, Europe, and most famously Latin America, where Nixon encountered hostile crowds in Peru and Venezuela. It is difficult to imagine any recent president giving such a breadth of weighty responsibilities to his second-in-command.

It is difficult to imagine any recent president giving such a breadth of weighty responsibilities to his second-in-command.

In domestic politics, Nixon had greater experience than his boss. Here, too, Eisenhower held the policy reins firmly, but he gave his vice president considerable responsibility. Eisenhower and Wisconsin Sen. Joseph McCarthy agreed on the danger of communism and the need to guard against Soviet espionage, but the president had a visceral dislike of McCarthy’s recklessness and, in particular, his attacks on Eisenhower’s beloved army. Nixon, who had served in the Senate with McCarthy, worked as a liaison with the Wisconsin senator’s wing of the party and sometimes managed to smooth over differences.

Even after McCarthy’s decline, Nixon worked as a go-between with other congressional leaders, including on the important issue of civil rights. In their 1956 reelection campaign, Nixon played a more active role than Eisenhower on the speaking circuit, owing partly to his greater entrenchment in partisan politics, and partly to Eisenhower’s reluctance to risk his weakening health by undertaking an arduous speaking schedule.

Nixon’s Leadership

Eisenhower’s health is a major theme of the book. A heart attack in 1955 left Ike hospitalized for six weeks. An attack of ileitis in 1956 and a mild stroke in 1957 also saw the president at less than full capacity for extended periods of time. During these times, he relied heavily on his cabinet, his staff, and especially his vice president.

Nixon’s leadership during Eisenhower’s ill health papered over a constitutional leadership gap that was not securely fixed until 1967.

Beyond chairing cabinet meetings and representing the administration in the public eye, Nixon’s leadership during Eisenhower’s ill health papered over a constitutional leadership gap that was not securely fixed until the passage of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution in 1967. In that respect, Eisenhower’s planning paid off. Had he died in office, the nation would have been spared the problem of a new president having to learn on the job.

The Eisenhower administration was popular, but its popularity did not extend beyond the occupant of the White House. Eisenhower and Nixon entered office with slim Republican majorities in both houses of Congress, but both were lost in the 1954 midterm elections. Republicans would not retake the Senate until 1981, and the House would retain its Democratic majority until 1995. Eisenhower’s leadership of the nation did not carry over into leadership of the party, to Nixon’s frustration. Nixon wanted Eisenhower to expend some of his personal mandate in building up the rest of the Republican Party. His failure to do so was a rare source of tension between the two men.

Finding Clarity

A lifelong non-partisan, Ike was determined to stay above the partisan fray as much as possible. The Democrats, reluctant to attack a personally popular war hero and national grandfather figure, obliged him. Instead, they concentrated their political and personal enmity on the second half of the ticket. This redounded to their benefit when the Democrats made massive electoral gains in the 1958 midterms and, even more so, when Nixon proved unable to win election to the presidency in his own right in 1960 despite Eisenhower’s continued popularity.

One source of Eisenhower’s popularity was his remove from the nitty-gritty of party politics. No candidate could inherit that mantle in 1960, least of all Richard Nixon, the partisan warrior the Democrats has spent the last eight years vilifying. That vilification continued after his death and into our own time, and while Nixon justly earned a lot of enmity as a result of Watergate, it’s also true that many of the partisan attacks leveled at him before and since have been in spite of the available evidence.

The President and the Apprentice is a welcome addition to the scholarship, and should drive the historiography of Richard Nixon away from lazy invective and back toward true historical analysis. In that respect, the book does exactly what good histories should all strive to do—make us resolve to assess the figures of our current age with more clarity and less caricature.

What We Learned from the South Carolina Republican Debate,"The latest Republican debate over the weekend moved forward the primary contest in some important ways. For those who missed it—and whose idea was it to start holding debates on Saturday nights, anyway?—here are the crucial developments that will change the contest going into the South Carolina primary.

1) The Supreme Court? Whatever

The big news Saturday was the sudden death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a development that threatens to tilt the Supreme Court to the left and sets up a kind of political Armageddon over the nomination of his successor. All of the candidates pretty much agreed that the Senate should refuse to confirm a replacement for Scalia until after the election.

But we didn’t really get a chance to differentiate the candidates on this issue, because moderator John Dickerson asked only one round of questions and let it go at that. No further follow-ups, no elucidation of differing constitutional interpretations or parliamentary tactics, no pushing back about whether it would be possible for President Obama to find a consensus nominee or whether Republicans could really resist confirming a new justice for a whole year.

This is an issue that has just leaped to the forefront of the election, and Dickerson pretty much dropped it. It was a big wasted opportunity.

But precisely because we didn’t get to explore this issue, it wasn’t the big news of the night.

2) Putting the ‘Rubot’ to Rest

The biggest news was probably Marco Rubio’s performance. In a damaging exchange from the last debate, Chris Christie accused Rubio of repeating the same rehearsed stump speech, and Rubio replied by doubling down on the repetition.

The gotcha moment didn’t exactly help Christie, who dropped out after the New Hampshire primary. But it helped Rubio’s detractors create a narrative that he is a shallow, unthinking “Rubot.” Anyone who’s been following Rubio knows there’s not much to this, but it hurt him in a very close contest, knocking him down into a narrow fifth place in New Hampshire. Afterward, Rubio promised his supporters this debate malfunction wouldn’t happen again.

Boy, did he fulfill that promise Saturday, delivering strong, well-informed responses on the Supreme Court, on foreign policy, and particularly this one on his experience making decisions in a crisis.

Well, let me tell you what has happened a couple of years ago. One of the hardest decisions you’ll ever make in Congress is when you are asked by the president to authorize the use of force in a conflict, because you are now putting your name, on behalf of the people of your state, behind a military action, where Americans in uniform could lose their life. So, in 2014, Barack Obama said he would not take military action against Assad unless it was authorized by the Senate, beginning on the Committee of Foreign Relations, where I am one of its members. And it was hard because you looked at the pictures. I saw the same images people saw. I’m the father of children. I saw the images of these little children [who] had been gassed and poisoned by their own leaders, and we were angry. Something had to happen, and there was the sense that we needed to seek retribution. And then I looked at Barack Obama’s plan. Barack Obama’s plan, which John Kerry later described as unbelievably small, and I concluded that that attack would not only not help the situation, it would make it actually worse. It would allow Assad to stand up to the United States of America, survive a strike, stay in power and actually strengthen his grip. So it was a difficult decision to make and when we only had a few days to look at and make a decision on it and I voted against Barack Obama’s plan to use force, and it was the right decision.

That was about the best response he could give to address the deficiency of not having executive experience (which most of the top Republican candidates lack).

Donald Trump is beginning to sound like a drunken robot.

By contrast, you know who’s really beginning to sound like a robot—though maybe a drunken robot? Donald Trump. We’re getting to the point where nine debates have exhausted his fund of campaign slogans, and he is beginning to answer every question with a collage of recycled phrases. You know the ones: “one of the worst deals I have ever seen negotiated,” “attack the oil and keep the oil,” “we have to rebuild our country,” “we don’t win any more,” “I’m leading in all the polls,” and so on.

It’s getting to the point where it would be pretty easy to put together a Random Trump Rant Generator that would stitch together rambling paragraphs out of a database of Trump’s favorite phrases. The task would be made easier by the fact that the results don’t need to coalesce into complete sentences.

But there was something new from Trump last night, which is that Trump finally had the meltdown we’ve all been waiting for.

3) The Trump Meltdown

Yes, I know, there are many of us who think Trump’s been having one continuous meltdown since the day he started running for office. But up to now, he’s really just been doing his regular reality TV/professional wrestling act, saying outrageous things and insulting people, playing to the cheap seats and making a show of being politically incorrect.

What was different Saturday night is that for the first time in these debates, he wasn’t doing it on his terms. He was doing it reactively, being pushed and goaded by the other candidate. What is worse is that he once again found himself on the defensive against Jeb Bush, who before now has lost every exchange with Trump until one brief moment in the last debate where he hammered Trump on his abuse of eminent domain. He hit that theme again this time as well as hitting Trump on his views on Iraq and 9/11. Trump was left sputtering and protesting and just trying to interrupt everyone all the time and shout them down, setting up Ted Cruz to shoot back, “Donald, adults learn not to interrupt people.”

Trump is losing his sense for what plays with the crowd.

Perhaps more important, Trump seems to be losing his sense for what plays well with the crowd. This time around, he claimed that George W. Bush was to blame for 9/11, coupled with the full Code Pink, “Bush lied, people died” view on the Iraq War. For the second debate in a row, when the audience booed him, he turned against the crowd and accused them all of being “Jeb’s special interest and lobbyists.”

When Trump wasn’t flailing and angry, he sounded like a crazy left-winger. When he wasn’t doing that, he just looked like he wasn’t having fun anymore.

I’ve been predicting Trump’s imminent demise for a while now, and you could write that off as wishful thinking, but I regard it more as an expression of faith in my fellow man, a confidence that a third of Republicans voters won’t continue to be taken in by this carnival barker.

And there’s more to this than vague hope. The single best analysis of the Republican primaries used John Boyd’s theory of the “OODA Loop” decision-making cycle to explain how Trump’s entry into the race disrupted all of the traditional candidates’ strategies, and it has taken too long for them to absorb this new information and adapt. But Trump himself does not have an OODA Loop. He doesn’t absorb new information and adapt—he just keeps doing the same old shtick. So eventually other candidates are going to learn how to get under Trump’s skin and set him off balance, and that’s what we started to see Saturday night.

4) Cruz vs. Rubio: It Begins

As a sideline to the Trump vs. Everyone shouting match, this debate had one exchange that highlighted where the race might be headed: a tense showdown between Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. That’s because if Trump is not the nominee, these two men are the most likely alternatives.

The real rap against Rubio is not that he robotically repeats talking points. It’s that he is all-too-eloquently telling us what we want to hear, but that he will sell us out once he actually gets into office. By contrast, Cruz presents himself as the true conservative whom we can trust to really mean what he says. So the most relevant and effective counterattack against Cruz is that he is actually unprincipled, playing fast and loose with the facts when it serves his own political purposes.

Who knew that in a Republican debate you could be attacked for not speaking Spanish?

Thus, when Cruz accused Rubio of secretly being soft on immigration in Spanish-language interviews—a debunked claim based on a poor translation; in reality, Rubio’s position on the issue in question is similar to what Cruz proposed in 2014—Rubio shot back with, “I don’t know how he knows what I said on Univision, because he doesn’t speak Spanish.” It’s a tale of two Hispanic immigrants and two immigrant traditions—one that discouraged the children of immigrants from speaking their parents’ native language and one that maintained a bilingual culture. But who knew that in a Republican contest that began with harsh anti-immigration rhetoric, one of the top candidates would end up being attacked for his lack of fluency in Spanish?

This was part of a larger attack on Cruz for distorting or exaggerating his opponents’ records, while glossing over parts of his own, in order to make himself look like the only ideologically pure option. Here was Rubio’s central line of attack:

When that issue was being debated, Ted Cruz, at a committee hearing, very passionately said, I want immigration reform to pass, I want people to be able to come out of the shadows. And he proposed an amendment that would legalize people here. Not only that, he proposed doubling the number of green cards. He proposed a 500 percent increase on guest workers. Now his position is different. Now he is a passionate opponent of all those things. So he either wasn’t telling the truth then or he isn’t telling the truth now, but to argue he is a purist on immigration is just not true.

The fact is that all of the Republicans have changed their position on immigration, taking a more conciliatory stand a few years ago, then moving to the right as they went into the primaries.

The danger of this is the old problem of mutually assured destruction. In fighting off the accusation that he is lying to voters, Rubio is making the case that Cruz is also lying to voters. The danger is that both men will succeed, and voters will conclude that they are all liars. I don’t have that much of a problem with this, by the way, because it’s just what I expect from politicians. Of course they’re going to change their views to try to match the mood of the voters. In other news, the sun will rise tomorrow. At the very least, our politicians should exercise a little discretion and not try to sell us on really obvious lies.

At any rate, that’s our preview of how the contest is likely to play out if or when the election winnows down to Cruz vs. Rubio. That remains as my top hope for the next few primaries: to get us as soon as possible to a three-man race that moves in two parallel tracks: the non-serious debate of Trump vs. the world, and the policy debate of Rubio vs. Cruz.

"Cut The Crap, Apple, And Open Syed Farook’s iPhone","For the sake of national security, Apple must assist the FBI in breaking into a seized phone. This particular iPhone 5C, said to belong to San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook, was lawfully obtained by the FBI pursuant to a warrant to search Farook’s Lexus. It may lead the authorities to additional terrorists living in our midst—if law enforcement can obtain access to its contents.

The issue here is practical, not legal. Nobody denies, not even Apple, that the FBI may lawfully search the contents of Farook’s iPhone. The problem is that the phone’s software prevents the FBI from performing its search. The phone is encrypted and locked with a passcode that imposes three barriers to access.

First, the iPhone’s software includes an option to erase the phone if more than 10 unsuccessful passcode entries are made. There is no way to know if Farook enabled this software option. Second, the iPhone’s software requires that the passcode be entered by hand using the device’s touch screen. Third, the iPhone’s software imposes a waiting period between unsuccessful passcode entries. Without these hurdles, the FBI could use a brute force attack using a computer to enter possible passcodes until it finds the right one and unlocks the phone.

Apple Has the Power

It is within Apple’s power to voluntarily disable these software-imposed practical challenges to the FBI’s lawful search of Farook’s iPhone. Apple has declined to help. That’s where the contentious February 16, 2016, order (PDF) comes in. Using the All Writs Act—a modern version of a law the American Founders passed in the first Congress—a federal magistrate judge has ordered Apple to help the FBI gain access to the device’s contents. Under the All Writs Act, a court can order a third party who stands in the way of administering justice to provide assistance so long as an alternative is not available, the ordered assistance is not unduly burdensome, and the third party is reasonably compensated.

Because only Apple has these signatures, only Apple can update Farook’s iPhone. The FBI cannot do this without Apple’s help.

Apple has the ability to temporarily update the software on Farook’s iPhone and remove the three barriers to using a brute-force attack. But before any iPhone will accept new software, it checks to see if the software update has a valid signature from Apple. Because only Apple has these signatures, only Apple can update Farook’s iPhone. The FBI cannot do this without Apple’s help.

Here, the court’s order is specifically tailored to both Apple’s and the government’s concerns. First, it requires Apple to use its access to temporarily remove only the three barriers to using a brute force attack discussed above. It does not require any adjustment to the iPhone’s encryption. Second, the order requires Apple to explicitly restrict its software update so that it can only run on Farook’s iPhone and be both temporary and reversible. It does not require altering any other software or access to any other iPhones. Third, the order allows Apple to comply with the order at its own facility, if it so chooses.

In other words, the FBI wants to bring Farook’s iPhone to Apple, let the manufacturer perform the temporary update, and then allow the FBI to remotely perform a brute force attack to discover Farook’s passcode. Once the FBI has discovered the passcode, Apple simply reverses the update and returns the iPhone with its original software and contents to the FBI.

The Objections Are Spurious

It must be emphasized: under the court’s order, at no point does Apple’s valid signature providing access for an iPhone update ever have to leave Apple’s control. It already has these signatures and uses them every time an iPhone anywhere in the world is updated. Claims that this order endangers the privacy of iPhone users are simply untrue. This order, issued pursuant to a lawful search warrant, has nothing to do with the privacy of iPhone users other than one dead terrorist. It is customized to respect Apple’s need to control access to its software and signatures and to restrict the application of temporary software to Farook’s phone alone.

This order, issued pursuant to a lawful search warrant, has nothing to do with the privacy of iPhone users other than one dead terrorist.

Opponents of the court’s order, including Apple’s Tim Cook, are using the loaded term “backdoor” to refer to the court’s proposed software update. Encryption backdoors have been a pipe dream for intrusive governments for decades. However, virtually everyone agrees that there is no way to create such backdoors without undermining security and privacy.

Until this week, discussions about removing the auto-erase and delay features of passcodes have never considered such an alteration to be a backdoor. Uses of the term to refer to the order in this case are thus misleading. This order does not require Apple to hand over a key to its encryption that could be used on other devices.

Another objection is that the court’s order could set a new precedent requiring aid from technology manufacturers in future cases. But this is not new precedent; this is old precedent. The All Writs Act derives from the Founders’ acknowledgment that sometimes courts require aid from third parties to administer justice. To the extent that Apple and other phone manufactures worry they may be asked to help law enforcement in the future, the Supreme Court set that precedent in a 1977 case called United States v. New York Telephone Co.

A third objection is that the court’s order is a step down a slippery slope to pervasive and secret government surveillance of our electronic devices. This is lingering fear from the National Security Agency scandal projected onto a transparent and lawful process. The court’s order was issued publicly, is now being debated publicly, and, as noted above, was only made possible because of a previously issued warrant. Even were Farook alive to assert a Fourth Amendment challenge, there is no question that the government has probable cause to both seize and search his cell phone. Apple has no constitutional standing to assert dead Farook’s privacy rights.

In light of the foregoing, it is wrong for Apple to attempt to frustrate the FBI’s efforts to gain access to the content of Farook’s iPhone. The privacy concerns are unresponsive to the court’s order. The security need is patent. Complying with the order is not unreasonably burdensome. And there is no alternative. Apple has vowed to appeal; it should lose.

Here's What An Honest Jazz Song About Hillary Sounds Like,"A famous jazz pianist has been so inspired by Hillary Clinton’s “quiet intensity and relentless purpose” that he recorded a song in her honor.

Marcus Roberts says he first heard Clinton speak back in 1992 when allegations of Bill’s infidelity were flying, and he was impressed by her loyalty. In an interview on “60 Minutes,” she admitted her marriage wasn’t perfect but said she was going to stick by her man because she loved and respected him after all they’d been through together. (Never mind the long list of women he seduced, threatened, and abused. Hillary took care of that “bimbo problem” because, you know, she loves her man.)

“People generally don’t admit to flaws, so I liked her candor,” Roberts said in an interview with Newsweek. “She made me laugh out loud.”

The Opposite of Cool Stability

The thought of Hillary actually admitting her flaws makes a lot of us laugh out loud. But, Roberts was taken with her (artists are just so fleeceable, aren’t they?), so last fall he began writing a song that would capture her personality in the form of an instrumental jazz composition.

Roberts titled the piece “It’s My Turn” (you can listen to it here). He says it’s punchy and “full of changes,” just like Clinton.

“All those meter and key changes symbolize constant evolution, and Hillary has certainly evolved from her early days in Arkansas,” Roberts says. “The song has a cool stability to it, reflecting her ability to change with time while maintaining her own quiet intensity and relentless purpose.”

Cool stability. Hmmm. Not exactly the words that come to mind when I think of Clinton. Given that, Roberts’ song needs a revision. Here’s our musical dedication to Hillary, appropriately titled “It’s NOT My Turn.”

Roberts told Newsweek he originally wanted to title the song, “I Guess I’m Just Overqualified.” Really? Even though her biggest shills can’t name any real accomplishments in her 20-year political career?

Hillary’s Greatest Hits of Lies and Deceptions

It seems Clinton supporters like Roberts need a little dose of reality. Let’s take a look at the top lies:

1.Those pesky emails. Clinton claimed her private email server was in “accordance with the rules and regulations in effect.” Not so much. A federal judge said she violated government policy in the storage of State Department messages, putting our national security at risk. Thanks for that, Hill. I’m sure Vladimir Putin will send you a thank-you note. Of course, she claims she didn’t handle any classified information, but we now know that’s a bunch of bull. Some of the emails were highly classified, and she knew they were at the time.

The fact that she lied not only to the American people but to the grieving families of the four men lost in the attack is what’s really disgusting.

2.“What does it matter, anyway?” This is probably one of the worst—Clinton blaming Benghazi on a “disgusting video” when we know from State Department documents that Clinton knew it was an actual terrorist attack that had nothing to do with any video. The fact that she lied not only to the American people but to the grieving families of the four men lost in the attack is what’s really disgusting. In case you missed it, here’s Jim Jordan ripping into her for lying. Good stuff.

And just because it’s so awesome, here’s Rand Paul’s classic takedown of Clinton over Benghazi and arming rebels in Syria. For those of you who think Clinton will have a gentler, kinder approach to foreign policy because she’s a woman, think again. She has bigger cojones than most dudes—and she likes “secret wars.”

3. Chelsea Clinton was jogging around the World Trade Center on 9/11. Nope. she was nestled safely in her New York apartment during the attack. Pathetic play on sympathy. The worst.

4. “I’m a progressive. But I’m a progressive who likes to get things done…how to find common ground, and I have proved that in every position that I’ve had, even dealing with Republicans who never had a good word to say about me, honestly.” Not even remotely true. The fact is when she was a senator for New York, Clinton had ZERO legislation with her name on it. Huff Post does a great job ‘splaining this one in “The Curious Myth of Hillary Clinton’s Senate Effectiveness.”

Clinton lied about making a run for it in Bosnia. A video shows her walking quite peacefully across the tarmac, smiling and greeting people.

4. She faced sniper fire when she landed in Bosnia. This whopper would be hilarious if it didn’t mock all of our men and women who have actually faced real sniper fire. Clinton lied about making a run for it in Bosnia (cue M*A*S*H theme song). A video shows her walking quite peacefully across the tarmac, smiling and greeting people.

5. Clinton says she was “instrumental” in the Northern Ireland peace process. Funny, because British negotiators tell a different story, saying, “Hillary Clinton was totally invisible at the actual negotiations.” Maybe she was wearing Harry Potter’s cloak.

6. “We’re dead broke.” Clinton tried to get in touch with the common folk with this doozy about her and Bill, but even left-wing media outlets weren’t buying it.

7. Her dying-fish flip-flopping on same-sex marriage. Her “evolution” is just fun to watch. Anderson Cooper didn’t think much of it and went for the jugular: “Even some Democrats believe you change your positions based on political expediency. You were against same-sex marriage. Now you’re for it. You defended President Obama’s immigration policies. Now you say they’re too harsh. You supported his trade deal dozen of times… Now, suddenly, last week, you’re against it. Will you say anything to get elected?” Ouch.

Just When You Thought We Were Done

Here’s more on Clinton’s fibs, obfuscations, and lies—for your entertainment. She has admitted some, but there’s a whole host of lies she won’t confess to (from Real Clear Politics).

She didn’t know about the FALN pardons.

She didn’t know that her brothers were being paid to get pardons that Clinton granted.

Taking the White House gifts was a clerical error.

She didn’t know that her staff would fire the travel office staff after she told them to do so.

She didn’t know that the Peter Paul fundraiser in Hollywood in 2000 cost $700,000 more than she reported it had.

She opposed NAFTA at the time.

She was instrumental in the Irish peace process.

She urged Bill to intervene in Rwanda.

She played a role in the ’90s economic recovery.

The billing records showed up on their own.

She thought Bill was innocent when the Monica scandal broke.

She was always a Yankees fan.

She had nothing to do with the New Square Hasidic pardons (after they voted for her 1,400-12 and she attended a meeting at the White House about the pardons).

She negotiated for the release of refugees in Macedonia (who were released the day before she got there).

With a record like that, is it any wonder that we suspect her of being less than honest and straightforward?

If you’re going to listen to some slow jazz dedicated to Hillary Clinton, skip Roberts’ version and play “It’s NOT My Turn.” It’s a lot more true to form.

Trump Should Release Tax Returns To Prove He’s Not A Fraud,"Donald Trump is playing whack-a-mole with his tax returns, only he’s the mole. Every time his head pops up with a new excuse for not releasing them, it gets whacked down by its own implausibility.

After being allowed to ignore the issue for the early part of the campaign season, he then began claiming his returns were being worked on, but they’re complicated given the gargantuan nature of his enterprise, and difficult to produce. Surely you can understand that; but they’re coming, no problem. This worked until last week. It began to unravel when fellow businessman Mitt Romney pointed out nothing was preventing Trump from releasing earlier years’ returns that were already done.

Hence, the mole’s head popped up with a new, improved version the other night at the debate: Now he’s claiming he can’t release his returns for the last four years, or 12, or 100, because they are being audited by the IRS and the reason they are being audited is because he is a big deal, unlike the other candidates, or, for that matter, you or me, and that’s why you don’t have to worry about whether his returns demonstrate that he is a big deal, because the fact that he is being audited proves it. Get it?

It will be interesting to see what the next excuse is, once it is well-known that nothing about an audit would prevent him from releasing the very returns that are being audited, although all indications are that he has absolutely no intention of taking that route, no matter how hard Romney or anyone else hammers him on it.

When Romney speculated about a possible “bombshell” being the motivation for Trump’s juking and jiving, what followed was classic Trumpian deflection, obfuscation, and word-play, followed by the usual marginally germane ad hominem counter attack: “Mitt Romney, who totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool, is now playing tough guy,” Trump tweeted. Never defend: Attack! Attack! Attack!

Trump, the Straight Talker?

Here’s the transcript of Trump’s response when Anderson Cooper asked him on CNN if he would release his returns:

Cooper: Why not just get them out there?



Trump: Well, because my returns are extremely complex and I’ll make a determination at the right time. I’m in no rush to do it. Nobody’s been bringing it up except Mitt Romney, and the reason he brings it up is that he lost in the last election and lost very badly, so I don’t know why he’s bringing it up. My tax returns are very complicated; I have many, many companies, I have, you know, tremendously, you know I have a very complex system of taxes, and, frankly, I get audited every single year, so, you know, my, unlike everybody else who never gets audited, I get audited every single year, which I think is unfair, but I go through large audits and that’s the way it is. But we’ll make a determination over the next couple of months; it’s very complicated.



Cooper: But point blank, does that mean you absolutely will release them, it’s just a question of when?



Trump: No, I’ll make a determination. I will be making that determine over the, over the next, I would say, couple of months we’ll make that determination, absolutely.

Quite a word salad, no? Bear in mind that this is one day prior to pressure causing him to upgrade his “audit” stratagem from being an inconvenience and annoyance, to some sort of legal barrier handcuffing his actions, however much he might otherwise love to cooperate. It is classic Trumpian obfuscation, deflection, bombast, and obscurantism. He could order his returns to be produced with one phone call, and they could appear within 24 hours or however long it took to find a hand-truck to retrieve them from in whatever closet or storage facility they currently reside.

No Matter What I Do, They’ll Vote for Me

What do you call his trying to make people think otherwise? I guess it’s not quite an outright lie, but, for sure, it’s a manifestation of contempt for his constituency and their willingness swallow whatever ridiculous dodge he chooses to toss their way.

It’s a manifestation of contempt for his constituency and their willingness swallow whatever ridiculous dodge he chooses to toss their way.

Plus, let’s be clear, he made a firm commitment, which any stand-up guy would do. He is “absolutely” committed to making a decision. I wonder how that would fly with a woman who was told by her beloved that he was absolutely committed… to making a decision… about whether or not he was going to give her a ring. You know, later. He’d be getting a one-way ticket to Tool Academy.

Of course, Trump’s first response, his go-to dance move, is to attack. Why talk about his tax returns? Let’s talk about Romney’s nefarious motivation for asking for them, and the fact that Romney is a loser. This is what he does every single time, about every single issue, and it is just simply astonishing that he is getting away with it.

How come? That’s just one of the things people are starting to wonder about, finally. It may be too late to make a difference, but Trump’s world is beginning to close in on him in a way that Marco Rubio’s attack the other night was starting to reveal, and it’s threatening the Trump mythology on a lot of different fronts all at once.

Trump University Is a Scam

Bob Woodward on “Morning Joe” last Tuesday tried valiantly to get his fellow panelists to stop interrupting him long enough to allow him to make the point that neither they, nor anyone else it seems, want to hear: Donald Trump has simply not been vetted on the personal level, and there are a host of questionable aspects of his background that haven’t been pulled together into a comprehensive picture. Woodword was attempting to highlight, as just one example, the truly alarming implications of something as seemingly corrupt as Trump University.

Donald Trump has simply not been vetted on the personal level, and there are a host of questionable aspects of his background.

Nobody’s gone to jail for Trump University (yet), and maybe they’ll find a way to argue there were no actual laws broken, but that doesn’t immunize it from being fairly described as exactly what it was: something anyone even minimally unencumbered by the blinders of an established agenda can recognize as being glaringly, inescapably a fraud. It’s a fraud configured, like pretty much all of them, to hoodwink unsuspecting and often desperate pigeons into coughing up their own dough, or allowing themselves to be used as a warm body to tap into federal (taxpayer) grants and loans, by opportunistic, amoral, and predatory fast operators.

Joe Scarborough’s position, stated and re-stated by talking over Woodward every time he tried to make the point, was that Trump University has been written about over and over, and it “doesn’t stick,” so move on, it doesn’t matter. Watch the exchange here, where Woodward tries to make his argument at 7:22.

The following day, Scarborough once again threw himself on the grenade, proclaiming there was no reason Trump should cave in to demands to release his tax returns, asking in a phrase of Olympian obtuseness, naivete, or sycophancy: “Why are his taxes relevant?”

Trump’s Business Acumen Is His Main Rationale for Winning

Well, here’s one way it’s relevant (there are quite a few): No presidential candidate in the history of the republic has been so completely reliant for his plausibility on one and only one very specific thing (with the possible exception of Dwight David Eisenhower, who won WWII, something Trump, so far, isn’t claiming to have done).

Trump’s supporters fall back on the notion that, sure, he’s a little rough around the edges, and sure, he’s had to break a few eggs, but he’s built a $10 billion company.

As Jonah Goldberg among others has pointed out, with Trump, it all boils down to this, absolutely nothing more and nothing less: “If I can build a $10 billion company, I can make the country great again.”

Over and over, Trump’s supporters fall back on the notion that, sure, he’s a little rough around the edges, and sure, he’s had to break a few eggs, but he’s built a $10 billion company (or eleven, or twelve, or whatever the number is today), and if he can figure out how to do that, we can rest assured that he can figure out how to build a 1,000-mile-long wall and get somebody else to pay for it, or bring back jobs from China, or let in only the good Muslims and keep out all the bad ones. Whatever.

You don’t need to know how he’s built a $10 billion company, since, for one thing, you and I wouldn’t understand all that arcane stuff, anyway, so he doesn’t think we ought to worry our pretty little heads about it. We just have to know that he did it, because that tells you everything you need to know, or should need to know, in order to have confidence that when he says he’s going to do something, by golly, he’s going to git ‘er done.

Rubio, as one example to the contrary, hasn’t built a $10 billion enterprise, so, unlike Trump, if he wants us to believe he’s going to fix the country, he needs to explain in a plausible way how he’s going to do it, or we’re going to doubt he can.

Why Trump’s Net Worth Matters

What is Trump’s real net worth, and how much does it matter? The answer to the former is that nobody knows, at least not yet, even though Trump touts his Federal Election Commission filings, as if having offered them up means all is known, when, in fact, it’s virtually impossible to decipher the brutally complicated three-dimensional skein of inter-related entities with the blunt-edged FEC financial reporting documents.

What if he hasn’t built a $10 billion company? What if he has only built an $8 billion company?

Trump most certainly knows this but prefers that you do not, in the same way he goes on about how he is “audited” every year, as if that is supposed to be some kind of imprimatur on what he is claiming, without any evidence at all. But “audit” sounds good and official and tycoon-ish, so it’s safe to move on.

Compared to the FEC filings Trump would have us believe are definitive, but which are most assuredly not, tax returns are something else entirely, infinitely more penetrating. No amount of purposely diversionary rodomontade is going to successfully render them either incomprehensible or irrelevant.

What about the latter? How much do the inner workings of his business and his net worth really matter?

Again, his credibility resides in the notion that he has built a colossal company worth ten or more billions of dollars. But what if he hasn’t? What if he hasn’t built a $10 billion company? What if he has only built an $8 billion company? Does that vaporize his premise, or does it simply change it to: “If I can build an $8 billion company, I can make the country great again”?

What if his worth is $4.5 billion, as Forbes estimates? “If I can build a $4.5 billion company, I can make America great again.” Still true? Suppose it is “Somewhere around $2.9 billion,” as well-schooled analysts at Bloomberg have posited?

What if it’s far, far less than that, and what if that’s one of the main reasons he doesn’t want to release any truly revelatory financial information?

When Does It Mean Donald Trump Is a Scam Artist?

At what point does all this stop being about the number and start being about something else, something far less coruscating, something shaky and uncertain and maybe a little bit ugly? At what point does it become about not telling the truth? At what point does it begin to feel like some kind of swindle? At what point does the dimension of the exaggeration begin to dismantle the architecture of the mythology?

At what point does it become about not telling the truth? At what point does it begin to feel like some kind of swindle?

P.T. Barnum was genuinely successful, remarkably so. As such, he was noteworthy and even admirable. But when we know that his impressive and undeniable achievements were based entirely on deft but flimsy hucksterism, does that render him inconsequential and hollow—or does the unflinching audacity of it all, the unlikely alchemy of it, make him, instead, presidential timber?

Woodward is right to wonder why all these questions aren’t being asked, why the “dots” he refers to aren’t being connected, why the full, integrated picture is being allowed to remain fragmented and hard to grasp, and you have to wonder why Scarborough and others are so willing to obstruct it from happening.

Why is no one calling BS on his continual practice of conflating and thereby excusing his own self-serving and ugly uses of certain laws and techniques with the more benign and acceptable versions of those same things? If his bankruptcies were a shovel he used to beat someone over the head and leave them in a bloody heap (and that’s pretty much what they were, if you ask his creditors and the vendors and their employees who got stiffed) he would respond that, hey, shovels are great things, everyone uses them.

You can dig foundations for hospitals or orphanages. If his eminent domain actions were a bulldozer used to steamroll property owners who had every right to the property they owned and didn’t want to give up, but which he wanted for his own purposes, he would say, hey, bulldozers are great: That’s how you create fields to grow wheat and feed the world.

Prove You’re Not Bluffing, Donald Trump

The incredible thing is that the media—and worse, other Republicans—are letting him get away with this sleazy game of three-card-Monte with the truth.

It is entirely possible that Donald Trump is an honest and truthful businessman, and an honest and truthful politician. It is possible that he is a less than honest businessperson (something Dana Loesch would certainly argue), not nearly what he purports to be, but is, nevertheless, an honest and capable politician. It is possible that he is a business fraud and a political fraud.

Nobody knows, and anybody who says he does is either implementing a strategy, discounting the obvious, blinded with clinical belief persistence, or a moron.

Nobody knows, and anybody who says he does is either implementing a strategy, discounting the obvious, blinded with clinical belief persistence, or a moron. Either that or decent, hardworking people so fed up with being called names and disparaged and undervalued that they want and maybe even need to believe they have found an authentic champion, and so just can’t bring themselves to believe their own lyin’ eyes.

If that’s the case, it’s on some level understandable, even courageous, and if it turns out that Trump isn’t all he claims to be cracked up to be, that will be, in the end, the one truly unforgivable thing.

That this could be the case at this late date is a failure of the media and the rest of the field. There is chatter that Trump isn’t releasing his returns because he wants to wait until he gets the nomination, because he doesn’t want to open his kimono that way if there’s no ultimate reward for it. If that’s the case, and he gets the nomination, and he then is forced to release his returns, the Democrats will redefine the concept of “field day.”

Let me put that another way: If the rest of the field allows him to get away with not releasing his returns—not the “complicated” ones he’s “working on,” but the ones from prior years that are ready-to-go, right now, this minute—it will be an act of monstrous political self-destruction.

Watch Clinton Call The Mother Of A Benghazi Victim A Liar,"During Wednesday night’s democratic debate, Hillary Clinton said the mother of a Benghazi victim lied.

Patricia Smith, the mother of Sean Smith, one of the four Americans who were killed by terrorists in an attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi during Clinton’s tenure, said in a CNN interview last October that Clinton lied to her about the circumstances surrounding her son’s death.

Instead of stating that her son’s death had been caused by an act of terrorism, Clinton blamed an inflammatory video that had been circulating online in the weeks leading up to the attack — a narrative she knew at the time to be false.

When asked about this on Wednesday, Clinton pushed back at Smith’s claim, saying the mother of the Benghazi victim was “absolutely wrong.”

“I can’t imagine the grief she has about losing her son,” Clinton said. “But she’s wrong. She’s absolutely wrong!”

“I and everybody in the [Obama] administration, all the people she named — the president, the vice president, Susan Rice — we were scrambling to get information that was changing literally by the hour,” she said. “When we had information, we made it public, but then sometimes we had to go back and say we had new information that contradicts it.”

During Clinton’s tenure as secretary of State, a U.S. consulate in Benghazi was attacked on Sept. 11, 2012. In the aftermath of the attack, Clinton and other members of the Obama administration blamed the attack on an inflammatory video that had been circulating at the time.

At the casket ceremony for the Benghazi victims, Clinton repeated this line of rhetoric, saying:

This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We’ve seen the heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We’ve seen rage and violence directed at American embassies over an awful internet video that we had nothing to do with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because it is senseless, and it is totally unacceptable.

But in an email she sent to her daughter Chelsea just hours after the attack, Hillary Clinton said the terrorist attack had been carried out by an “Al Queda-like group,” implying she knew it had been premeditated terrorism.

As The Federalist reported in October, Hillary’s own e-mail correspondence shows that from day one Clinton had two different stories surrounding the cause of the Benghazi attack. Under her leadership, the State Department pushed out a false, and politically advantageous, narrative to the American people blaming an Internet video, while privately acknowledging that the events in Benghazi were purely motivated by organized Islamic terrorism.

The Next President Inherits A Middle East In Flames,"For the last several weeks, my Twitter feed has been consumed with Trump-mania. What he said, what he didn’t, who incited whom to what. Who can beat him? Can he beat Hillary? Is this the end of the GOP?

While these are all important and necessary analyses of this disaster of a primary season, there are, in fact, other things going on in the world—especially in the Middle East and North Africa. It’s essential to stay abreast of these current affairs because our next president will have to confront them come January, making this election all the more important. So, let’s survey the current state of disrepair in the region.

Turkey Tightens the Screws

On Sunday night, a car bomb devastated the business district of Ankara. This is the second time in the last month that an attack like this has struck the city. No group has yet claimed responsibility, but Turkish officials suspect Kurdish separatists. ISIS has also been responsible for attacks in recent months. At least 37 are dead and over 100 wounded as a result of Sunday’s attacks. This puts the tally to nine attacks, with more than 200 dead, in the past nine months.

This most recent round of violence escalates already mounting tensions between Turkey and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK. Turkey has called on the United States to end cooperation with the Syrian Kurdish force, one of our better ground partners in the fight against ISIS. Meanwhile, the Turkish government began bombing the Kurds in northern Iraq and southeast Turkey last month, and attacked again on Monday in reaction to the Ankara bombing. Both Turkey and the Kurds are vital partners in fighting ISIS, leaving the U.S. without any good options.

Libya and Tunisia Foster ISIS

In the years since Muammar Gaddafi was ousted, a power vacuum has allowed ISIS to take root in Libya and given it easy access to its neighbor to the west, Tunisia. ISIS operatives based in Libya were responsible for the March 2015 attack on the Bardo Museum in Tunis that left 19 dead, and the June 2015 attacks on the Sousse beach in Tunisia that killed 39.

In the years since Muammar Gaddafi was ousted, a power vacuum has allowed ISIS to take root in Libya.

On March 7, weeks after the United States targeted an ISIS training camp in northeast Libya, ISIS attacked the Tunisian city of Ben Gardane, after which Tunisia closed its borders with Libya. Meanwhile, Tunisia is the largest supplier of foreign-born ISIS fighters (7,000). All this bodes extremely ill for both countries.

President Obama strongly criticized British Prime Minister David Cameron and former French President Nicholas Sarkozy last week for not following through in Libya after the ouster of Gaddafi. He called it a “s— show.” Britain is now pledging 1,000 soldiers to join an international coalition of 6,000 troops to protect the new Libyan government. Meanwhile, just last month Obama turned down a proposal by the U.S. military to hit ISIS in its Libyan regional stronghold of Sirte. He’s talking the talk, but, well, you get it.

The Ivory Coast Heats Up

On Sunday, three gunmen in bulletproof vests attacked a beach resort on the Ivory Coast, killing at least 15 civilians and three military personnel, including four French nationals. These attacks were carried out by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), the same group responsible for attacking hotels in Mali and Burkina Faso in November and January, respectively.

These attacks represent a change in tactics for the group, which for the past decade has been attacking impoverished countries in the Sahara. Now, the terrorists are focusing on wealthier enclaves in more economically stable African countries, not unlike ISIS’s targeting of tourist spots in Tunisia. In a statement, AQIM said this is a warning to countries that cooperate with France’s counterterrorism efforts.

Strangely, Iran More Aggressive After Nuclear Deal

In the past few weeks, Iran has tested ballistic missiles with the capacity to carry nuclear weapons that could reach Israel. The U.N. Security Council is condemning these tests but isn’t taking any punitive action, while the European Union is claiming Iran didn’t violate the nuclear deal.

The United States and its allies are about to submit an official report to the Security Council accusing the Islamic Republic of violations of international accords. Russia, meanwhile, is pointing out that the tests are not, in fact, violations because of the change in language made upon Iran’s request during the negotiation period. Sen. Robert Menendez protested this change at the time as a dangerous concession, which U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry insisted wouldn’t make a difference in our ability to sanction ballistic missile tests. So much for those snapbacks sanctions…

Russia Gains Strength

Then there’s Russia. The country suddenly announced a withdrawal of the majority of its military presence from Syria this week, as peace talks in Geneva resumed Monday. President Vladimir Putin says Russia’s goals in the country have been reached. He’s not wrong. Before Russia stepped in in September, Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad’s government was faltering. Russia came in purportedly to help fight ISIS, but in reality has been bombing moderate rebel forces backed by the United States. This has allowed Assad to gain the strength needed to negotiate from a position of power, leaving ISIS relatively unscathed.

This six-month foray has allowed Russia to reassert itself as a major player internationally.

Now that Assad has been sufficiently propped up and Russia has flexed its muscles against U.S. interests in the region, it can go home. In doing so, it’s thumbing its nose at the West. It doesn’t need to give the United States a heads up that it’s withdrawing. And Russia is triumphantly pointing out that, unlike America, it can easily touch down in the Middle East, accomplish its mission, and pull out. No quagmires or extended wars.

This six-month foray has allowed Russia to reassert itself as a major player internationally, especially after its relative ostracization when it annexed Crimea in March 2014.

Elsewhere in Syria, the al-Qaeda-backed rebel group, the al-Nusra Front, attacked Western-backed moderate rebels in a key rebel stronghold over the weekend, taking over bases and U.S.-supplied weapons. Moderates fear this will put them in a weak negotiating position at the peace talks in Geneva, and will be used as an excuse for the regime to attack rebel-held areas. This is a bad sign for the moderates and for U.S. efforts in the region.

Elsewhere, Things Are Also Bad

Add to all of this the ongoing civil war in Yemen, where more than 40 civilians were killed by Saudi-led coalition airstrikes in Haja province Tuesday, and the ongoing wave of stabbings of Israelis by Palestinians.

We had better well have a plan—a consistent one that can endure beyond a single election cycle.

This isn’t meant to be alarmist or to whip people into a frenzy. It is, however, a reminder of the serious instability in the Middle East and Africa, which will require more than Donald Trump’s council of one to manage. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper’s recent worldwide threat assessment describes the United States as facing more foreign policy threats than at any time since World War II.

As former secretary of Defense Robert Gates said at a recent talk, the Middle East and North African are on fire and are probably going to burn for the next 30 years. We had better well have a plan—a consistent one that can endure beyond a single election cycle. This will require the general support of the American people, which is not an easy task.

We can only hope that these problems, which are now spreading beyond Syria and Iraq, are on every candidate’s radar, and that voters think carefully about who is the right person to take them on.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/03/17/the-next-president-inherits-a-middle-east-in-flames/,2016-03-17
Europe's Fear Of 'Islamophobia' Led To The Belgium Attacks,"Last week, I wrote about the myriad instabilities in the Middle East and North Africa, from the civil war in Yemen to the bombings in Turkey and the ongoing disaster in Syria. What I didn’t touch on, however, is how these instabilities are reverberating on the European continent. Sadly, this week another tremor was felt. Today, during the morning commute, terrorists bombed a train station and the airport in Brussels. So far, more than 30 are reported dead and more than 150 injured.

These attacks come five months after the Paris attacks that shocked the world and took the lives of 130 men and women. These terrorists had pledged their allegiance to ISIS and were carrying out what they believed to be holy jihad. Although most of the perpetrators were killed during the attacks or in the days after in a suburb of Paris, one man eluded the police. That man, Salah Abdeslam, was captured on Friday after a months-long manhunt.

The city has been on high alert since his arrest. They knew Abdeslam had a large network in Brussels, and that he had been planning more attacks. They feared his network of operatives would lash out. They also discovered detonators in a safe house last week before his arrest. Presumably, today’s bombings in Brussel were a reaction to Abdeslam’s apprehension, either out of concern that he would talk or that the police would soon be on to them, too.

What is shocking the Brussels police, however, is the scale of Abdeslam’s network and its capacity to help him avoid capture for so long in a city that authorities were scouring for him. On the night of the Paris attacks, Abdeslam crossed the border into Belgium with the help of a friend. Although his name was flagged as a person of interest, the border guards’ system had not yet been updated with the information that he was one of the suspects. From there, it’s presumed that he returned home to Brussels, where he continued planning more attacks.

How is it that in a prosperous European country there can be enough support within the Muslim community for a man who had pledged his allegiance to ISIS?

In the months before the Paris attacks, he and the Syrian fighters with whom he linked up were helped by Abdeslam’s family, childhood friends, and other petty criminals to remain concealed. In the months after the attacks, he was helped by what it seems is a massive network of “friendlies” who were willing to shelter, hide, and perhaps even work with him on the next terrorist plot. When Abdeslam was finally apprehended, he was living a few hundred yards from his family’s home—right under the nose of the police.

Here we come to the crux of the problem. How is it that in a prosperous European country there can be enough support within the Muslim community for a man who had pledged his allegiance to ISIS, has already successfully completed one terrorist attack and is planning others, to be protected and aided?

The answer is that this is a problem of Europe’s own creating—and it’s not going away. Beginning in the post-World War II era, Europe was in need of workers to pad its depleted work force. A natural place to look was North Africa, in former colonies of Spain and France. While it was assumed that migration would be short-term, the reality is that the men who came to work stayed, and later brought over their families. Europe made no plan for how to house and assimilate these families (see Christopher Caldwell’s excellent book, “Reflections on the Revolution in Europe,” for an in-depth discussion of this topic).

More to the point, Europe was uncomfortable asking its Muslim communities to assimilate. European leaders felt that would be too reminiscent of the colonial era. Their guilt and newfound “enlightenment” guided them to leave these people to their communities, culture, and religion. At the same time, however, they also ostracized them. What resulted was tight-knit majority-Muslim enclaves often on the outskirts of major European cities (like Saint Denis on the outer edge of Paris, where one of the Paris attackers was found).

They are loyal, at best, to the local Muslim community with whom they share a sense of solidarity, or in its worst manifestations, to ISIS and its global sense of destiny.

These communities are volatile places that are not dissimilar, in some ways, to certain American inner cities. They remain close-knit via shared language, Arabic, shared religion, Islam, and a continued influx of immigration from their countries of origin. This is no longer just family reunification. It is common, for example, for second- and third-generation North African immigrants to look to their ancestral home for a spouse. This is most common among men. They want a woman uncorrupted by European values. These marriage practices keep a continuous supply of first-generation mothers having second-generation children.

These problems have now come home to roost. Europe has on its hands millions of Muslims, many of whom, although certainly not all, identify first as Muslims and second as Europeans. They are loyal, at best, to the local Muslim community with whom they share a sense of solidarity, or in its worst manifestations, to ISIS and its global sense of destiny. This manifests itself in its most extreme in attacking the great evil that is the West—even if it has been their home for their entire life. But, as has played out in the last few months, it is also manifesting itself in a large community of people willing to aid and abet terrorist networks in Europe.

What makes this situation so unique, and so dangerous, is the cooperation of foreign and domestic operatives. Syrian fighters, who, according to the Belgian Justice Minister Koen Geens, are coming over “constantly,” are wholly unfamiliar with Europe. But because they are plugged into a network of people who are not themselves terrorists but have little allegiance to Europe and have all the necessary local knowledge, the would-be terrorists can easily move undetected and successfully execute their attacks.

This latest attack in Brussels would not have been possible without this network of native-born, disaffected Muslims. For that, Europe has no one to blame but itself.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/03/22/europes-fear-of-islamophobia-led-directly-to-the-belgium-attacks/,2016-03-22
Here’s What We Know About The Terrorist Attacks In Brussels,"A series of terrorist attacks on Brussels’ airport and subway system today left more than 30 dead, the European Union’s capital city on lockdown, and world leaders mourning as they ordered increased security. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks.

The number of dead stands at 34: at least 20 were killed in a subway blast in the district of Maalbeek, and at least 14 were killed in two explosions at Brussels Airport, at least one of which was a suicide bombing, according to CNN reporting. Belgian media reports that as many as 170 were injured in the attacks.

“We were fearing terrorist attacks, and now that has happened,” Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said, calling for calm and solidarity in a “tragic moment.” Brussels residents were told to “avoid all movement.”

The attacks come just days after the world’s most wanted terrorist suspect was captured in Belgium. Salah Abdeslam, suspected in the Paris terror attacks that killed 130, was arrested after a gun battle Friday along with four other suspects. Michel said there was no information tying the attacks to the arrest but noted the timing.

Frédéric Van Leeuw, a Belgian law enforcement official, said additional border security and police had been mobilized and the country’s threat level was at its highest. The New York Police Department is “increasing security around the city,” according to Washington Post reporting.

President Obama was briefed on the attacks on his trip to Cuba.

World leaders responded in the wake of the attack, with UK Prime Minister David Cameron calling a meeting of his country’s special security team, dubbed Cobra and increasing police at “ports, airports, Tube stations and international railway stations.”

I have just spoken to the Belgian PM and offered our sympathies and condolences. We must stand with Belgium at this very difficult time. — David Cameron (@David_Cameron) March 22, 2016

“The whole of Europe has been hit,” said French President Francoise Hollande, calling for increased intelligence sharing across the European Union to prevent future attacks.

The scene inside the airport was bloody and frantic, according to New York Times reporting:

Belinda How, a traveler from Malaysia who was in Brussels for a vacation, said she had been lining up to check in for an Etihad Airways flight when she heard the blast. “I was the last passenger queuing up,” she said. “I was very close to the first blast. Everybody was screaming.” She added: “I said to my son — he is a Down syndrome special-needs child — ‘You have to run.’ He said, ‘My leg hurts.’ I think he was panicked. I left my luggage, dragged him and ran. Before I ran out, there was another bomb.”

Facebook activated its Safety Check feature to allow those in Brussels to report on their well-being.

How The Brussels Attacks Will Affect Blood-And-Soil Politics,"As the terrible news of the terrorist attacks in Brussels continues to come in, we should understand a few important things in the days and weeks ahead.

First, we should expect European leaders and the media to double down on their pious exhortations not to conflate Syrian refugees with terrorists and to resist “Islamophobia,” as if suspicion about unassimilated Muslim enclaves in Europe is a greater threat than the terrorists hiding in them. We heard this almost before the smoke cleared from the Paris attacks in November, and we will continue to hear it.

Never mind that some of the Paris attackers slipped into Europe posing as refugees. Never mind that the relevant data suggests a majority of those entering Europe are not refugees at all but economic migrants. Never mind that Salah Abdeslam, the mastermind of the November attacks in Paris whose capture on Friday likely triggered Tuesday’s attacks, was running a still-active terrorist cell likely made up of ISIS fighters from Syria and European-born Muslims. European leaders, such as they are, understand these things. They have simply chosen to bear the consequences. “We were fearing terrorist attacks, and that has now happened,” Belgium Prime Minister Charles Michel said at a news conference Tuesday.

Europe must answer a question it has been avoiding since the end of World War II: what is the purpose of immigration?

Second, Europe must answer a question it has been avoiding since the end of World War II: what is the purpose of immigration? If it is to supply a laboring class, then Europe must insist on integration and assimilation along the lines of the American model so the sons and daughters of its immigrant class can rise and become fully participating members of the social order. If not, then it must accept its future as a blood-and-soil continent of natives on one side and permanent outsiders on the other, with all the intermittent violence that comes with it.

It is more likely that in the near term, current European leaders will say Europe should adopt the American model of integration, but we should not expect them to push for significant reforms. Although German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrat party suffered significant losses in state elections earlier this month almost entirely as a reaction to Merkel’s migrant policy, she said the policy would not change.

If voting trends continue, Merkel and her ilk will eventually be replaced by the likes of Frauke Petry of Germany’s nationalist Alternative for Germany and Marine Le Pen of France’s right-wing National Front. These leaders will take the blood-and-soil route. Because much of the support for these right-wing parties comes from younger voters, as is the case with the Sweden Democrats (now the most popular party in the country), they represent the future of European politics, not just its troubled past.

America, against its better instincts and traditions, could quite possibly take the blood-and-soil route.

Third and most disturbing is that America, against its better instincts and traditions, could quite possibly do the same. Donald Trump’s reaction to the San Bernardino attacks was to propose a temporary ban on all Muslims entering the United States. Instead of sinking his candidacy, Trump’s polls numbers increased, with six in 10 Republican voters saying they agreed with the Muslim ban.

Trump’s entire campaign thus far has been an extended appeal to nationalism and nativism, from his pledge to build a wall along the southern border to his promise to deport some 11 million illegal immigrants. That appeal has resonated with a surprising number of voters, who either don’t notice or don’t care that it is also, implicitly, an appeal for a more active and intrusive state.

Trump isn’t the only one sounding this note. After the attacks in Belgium on Tuesday, Sen. Ted Cruz released a statement saying, “We need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized.” Cruz probably means that in a benign way, and certainly, authorities in the United States should do what they can to ensure Muslim communities don’t become radicalized.

The task of integration and assimilation is a function primarily of culture, not politics.

But the task of integration and assimilation does not begin with law enforcement, or even lawmakers. It is a function primarily of culture, not politics. America has done a singular thing in the history of the world: forged a multicultural society on the basis of specific ideas. As I wrote recently about the EU migrant crisis, “The fragile thing the American Founders built is based after all on a rigorous acceptance of a Christian view of human nature: All men are created equal. But we know from hard experience that this is not a ‘universal value.’ It is not indigenous to all the world’s cultures.”

We Americans have managed to avoid the trap of European blood-and-soil politics by insisting that newcomers accept our principles. That insistence has enabled immigrants from all over the world to come here and build a life as Americans. It is the great genius of our republic. Europe never really tried to do this, but simply accepted immigrants as laborers after World War II and hoped they would eventually go home. They never did, and now the continent is confronting a civilizational crisis of its own making.

The good news for us is that we don’t have to go through what Europe is going through as long as we protect and defend the promise of America, which is this: anyone can be an American. You just have to choose it.

Stop Whining About Islamophobia And Focus On Jihadis,"Even before ISIS claimed responsibility for the terrorist attack in Brussels that broke early Tuesday morning, folks on Twitter, including members of the leftist media, immediately began offering condolences to Muslims, blaming bigotry, and making other ridiculous apologies.

After San Bernardino, Paris, and now Brussels, to name just a few recent cities attacked by the same global terrorist network that shares one religious identity, it’s intellectually dishonest at best and evil-enabling at worst to focus on Islamophobia rather than examine Islamic jihadism for what it is. By Islamophobia, of course, I mean what the Left means when it essentially accuses people of bigotry for expressing valid concerns about radical Islam.

Concern for perpetrators over victims is a hallmark sign of political correctness gone awry. Nothing demonstrates a person’s allegiances better than seeing for whom they offer condolences in the wake of tragedy. In this case, members of the media and Muslims seem to be more worried people will be afraid of them or mock their belief system than interested in dissecting why and how those who embrace said beliefs continue to terrorize parts of the world (it’s not too difficult a question to answer) and, as importantly, how they can be stopped.

To my Muslim sisters & brothers: I know horrible things will be said about you & Islam today – I am so, so sorry. Please know I stand w you.

i think in times of islamophobia, we as muslims have to understand that we do not have to justify ourselves for crimes we did not commit.

There is only one global religion right now that has major sects teaching that eternal bliss will come to those who carry out acts of terrorism. That’s Islam. This doesn’t mean every Muslim is a violent person or is actively planning to commit acts of terrorism, and no one is accusing all Muslims of this. However, when’s the last time an ISIS member was not a self-described Muslim? Indeed, “ISIS supporters cheered the attacks as stalwart expressions of the noble teachings of Islam.”

Ben Shapiro’s classic video neatly explains why radicalism is not a tiny minority of Islam. These poll findings persist, and are a serious, credible reason it is fair to ask the Muslim community to deal with its obvious internal problems that consistently lead to the reprehensible mass murder of innocent people.



This is a matter of emphasis. The message the Muslim world does not need to hear right now is “Please forgive us because our existence makes your religious brothers and sisters so angry that they keep mass murdering us,” but “Deal with your violence problem or we’ll do it for you.”

Things that ""radicalize"" Muslims: – YouTube videos

– Cartoons

– Hashtags

– Climate Change Strangely never on the list: – Islam

As Don Hodges said in The Telegraph following the Paris attacks: “There is a link between Islam and terror. That is an indisputable fact. Those carrying out the Paris attacks claimed to be doing so in the name of the Islamic faith. All the attackers self-identified as Muslims. Their statements made clear that – perverse though their interpretation of it may be – Islam was their ideological inspiration.”

An ISIS supporter posted on Twitter: “With the permission of God, the lions came to take revenge for the killing of Muslims in Syria and Iraq.” Another declared: “#Brussels, if you continue your war against the religion of Allah then this is our response.” Another shared a graphic image that allegedly showed a man who was wounded, and declared: “Allahu Akbar, #Belgium_is_on_fire_from_explosives.” (These accounts have since been suspended.)

How many more innocent people must die around the world before we care more about security than political correctness? How much more must we eagerly placate overblown concerns of Islamophobia before we address the clear and present danger of Islamic jihadists? You know what will really reduce Islamophobia? Stopping Islamic terrorism. People react strongly against Muslims in the wake of terror like this because Muslims are the ones committing global terrorist attacks. If more Muslims publicly denounced terrorism and demanded increased cooperation with law enforcement within their communities like Christians and pro-lifers do in analogous circumstances, people would treat Muslims more like they do Christians and pro-lifers — which is to say, not with generalized suspicion and fear.

It’s time we stopped worrying after every terrorist attack if Muslims will get their feelings hurt, and started discussing the radical jihadists systematically attempting to destroy the way we live and murdering people we love—and the means by which we will protect ourselves from this dangerous doctrine.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/03/23/stop-whining-about-islamophobia-and-start-focusing-on-islamic-jihadis/,2016-03-23
What America Should Learn From The Attack In Brussels,"I really should have titled this “What America should learn from the attack in Brussels but probably won’t.” Because though we live in a nation with a well-assimilated, diverse and patriotic Muslim population, the situation could always change. Like Europe, we could embrace immigration from places teeming with radicalism. We could disincentivize assimilation. We could dismiss anyone who has legitimate concerns about these threats as bigots.

After every terrorist attack, much of the media predictably cautions Americans about the impending wave of “Islamophobia” — one of the most vacuous and misleading terms in political discourse. Even before the bodies had been cleared off the streets in Brussels, where attacks claimed at least 34 lives with scores of others wounded, the usual suspects were warning about hurt feelings and that big backlash that never comes.

Nothing wrong with being vigilant, I suppose.

But by blaming Islam, we are doing just what the terrorists want. That familiar refrain, however, is problematic. The Left regularly offers laughable moral equivalences, reaching back — centuries, if needed — to deflect a simple reality: in the contemporary world, political terrorism is almost exclusively an Islam problem. Exempting Islam for any culpability for that terror is as ludicrous as blaming all Muslims for it.

Now, there’s virtually nothing progressives can’t turn into an ethnocentric grievance, but there are real-life consequences to this kind of intellectual dishonesty.

These days, rather than exerting societal pressure on immigrants to assimilate and embrace Western cultural norms, we’re the ones being pressured to accept that all ideologies are equally worthwhile and moral. Anything less is a form of intolerance or racism. And with the explosion of Muslim immigration to the West, including the United States, the pressure to engage in this kind of bogus compassion will only grow.

Writing after the Paris attack, Ian Tuttle at NRO crunched the immigration numbers:

In 1992, 41 percent of new permanent residents in the United States — green-card holders — hailed from the Asia-Pacific region, the Middle East and North Africa, or sub-Saharan Africa, according to the Pew Research Center. A decade later, the percentage was 53 percent. Over that same period, predictably, the number of Muslim immigrants coming to the United States annually has doubled, from 50,000 to approximately 100,000 each year. In 1992, only 5 percent of Muslim immigrants came from sub-Saharan Africa; 20 years later, it was 16 percent. Of the 2.75 million Muslims in the United States in 2011, 1.7 million were legal permanent residents.

In Europe, assimilation has been a disaster. With large isolated pockets of Muslims, there is not only economic discontent but a place for radicalism to percolate. Now, many European nations have added massive numbers of potentially disaffected Muslims into this combustible mix.

In Germany, one of the most world’s most advanced (and generous) nations, the families of Turkish immigrants who came in 1950s still can’t find their way in mainstream society. Much the same can be said of Algerians in France. Terrorists can come from all kinds of backgrounds, but shiftlessness and poverty probably makes young people susceptible to this kind of radicalism. Importing large numbers of new refugees without any realistic plan to help them avoid a similar fate is cultural self-immolation. We have no duty to follow.

Not all, but much of that “Islamophobia” is aimed at chilling criticism of illiberalism. The problem, even in Europe, we’re often told, is that Muslims are too constricted by the customs and rules of Western society. Take this piece in Al Jazeera America—a position intimated by many others on the Left: “Why should American Muslims have to assimilate? Some cultures in the US have been allowed to remain distinct, so why the double standard?”

Some cultures are disposed towards the promotion of peace, prosperity, and liberty. Others are not.

Even we concede that a double-standard exists (it does, but not in the sense the author imagines) it is hard to argue that some cultures have a propensity to embrace illiberalism and some do not. And the Islam problem goes well beyond the person who chooses to blow up an airport terminal or shoot down concert goers or engage in genocide or stab mothers in front of their children. Aside from secularized communities, there is an institutionalized illiberalism—misogyny, anti-Christian and Jewish bigotry, constraints on free expression, the kind of homophobia that ends with people swinging from gallows, etc.—throughout the Islamic world. Pointing this out is not racism. Theology is not a skin color. And the United States will not be given immunity from dealing with this reality.

This dynamic feeds the xenophobic case of the nationalists. These growing nationalistic movements—and Trumpism can be thrown in with them—offer the dangerous counterbalance to the Left’s phony empathy. When politicians—people like the president—condemned Americans for harboring legitimate fears about immigration or violence, they will soon look elsewhere for allies. They will embrace bad ideas. And both groups will be responsible for the slow-motion cratering of liberal values at home.

What Tintin Teaches Us About The Brussels Attacks,"When I was growing up, I learned a great deal about life from reading Hergé’s comic books – The Adventures of Tintin. The boy reporter, his dog, Snowy, and his foul-mouthed companion Captain Haddock are the main figures in adventure after adventure, which place the young hero in the midst of crises which often have world-changing consequences.

The scenarios they inhabit are full of threats and intrigue, the potential for disaster, and the suspense that comes from an ever-present possibility of crime, coups, and acts of violence. The protagonists are aware of this, and always on their guard – representing a very Belgian spirit: they are Gallic, intrepid, and mean.

As Benjamin Kerstein wrote on the subject, from 2009:

The truth is that Tintin has always been the Gallic hero par excellence. There is nothing remotely American about him. And what those of us who love the character and revere his creator — the melancholic and childlike Herge — have always responded to has been precisely that. For us, Tintin was our earliest window into another world. A world far older, more compromised, more frightening, and more pessimistic than the wide-open dreamscape of American pop culture. A world infused with the ever-presence of the political and that particularly European sense of crisis. Tintin’s world is a fantastic landscape that is always in danger of collapse before real-world forces and real-world violence. There could be nothing that is further from the phantasmagoria of the American superhero comics, with their ubermenschen laying waste to the forces of evil, always rendered, even in the supposedly ‘grim and gritty’ genre, as incredulous grotesques, their evil made manifest by their physical deformity and the derangement of their actions.



This was Herge’s genius. His world of adventure is an inversion of the original. The traditional children’s tale brings the adult world into that of the child, so that it is forced to play by a child’s rules: the manic bursts of energy, the corrosive violence of an unfettered and unapologetic Id, authority and evil as mere caricatures of themselves. Herge brought the child’s world into that of the adult.

What Tintin reveals to us about the Brussels attacks is how much that perspective – the childlike but accurate perception of the world – has faded in our common discussion of reality.

Megan Oprea makes a strong case that it is Europe’s fear of “Islamophobia” – their unwillingness to pressure immigrants and refugees into assimilation as part of Western culture – that lead to the insulating environment allowing terror networks to thrive. The reality is that these attacks will change nothing in established policy or politics — just as none of the previous massacres did — and that’s why the people in the U.S. and Europe both are moving into revolt.

The instinct of our ruling class in America and Europe is always to reaffirm pieties. The people believe it for a long time, because they want to, but eventually they conclude they’ve been deceived. And in furthering that deception, the current leaders will set the stage for more blood-and-soil politics.

It is more likely that in the near term, current European leaders will say Europe should adopt the American model of integration, but we should not expect them to push for significant reforms. Although German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrat party suffered significant losses in state elections earlier this month almost entirely as a reaction to Merkel’s migrant policy, she said the policy would not change.



If voting trends continue, Merkel and her ilk will eventually be replaced by the likes of Frauke Petry of Germany’s nationalist Alternative for Germany and Marine Le Pen of France’s right-wing National Front. These leaders will take the blood-and-soil route. Because much of the support for these right-wing parties comes from younger voters, as is the case with the Sweden Democrats (now the most popular party in the country), they represent the future of European politics, not just its troubled past.

Sometimes it takes the perspective of an innocent to perceive what the adults refuse to see. What Tintin reminds us of in the context of the Brussels attack is the extent to which our modern respectable leadership has deluded themselves, and for so long, about the world they now inhabit.

They refuse to see what even a child could see: that the Emperor has no clothes, that their claims to the impacts of refugee ghettos and unassimilated Muslim populations are unbelievable, and that no amount of fear and death will compel them to reevaluate their positions. The perspective of the leadership class seems, upon further consideration, all the more naive, disconnected from reality. And that is why the people cry to replace them.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/03/23/what-tintin-teaches-us-about-the-brussels-attacks/,2016-03-23
What World War II Can Teach Us About Islamic Terror,"On March 18, international counterterror authorities celebrated the capture of Salah Abdeslam, the ISIS-linked Belgium national heavily responsible for last year’s Islamic terror attacks in Paris. Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel awoke Tuesday morning to find ISIS had rocked Brussels again. Two explosions at the Brussels airport and a third at the city’s train station killed 34 people and injured hundreds.

The escalating acts of Islamic terrorism in the last six months—with multiple attacks on Paris, attacks in Brussels, and even the far-reaching relatively unprecedented domestic attack in San Bernardino, California—show the deep-rooted hold of the greatest generational challenge of our time: radical Islam. ISIS has already devastated a Muslim population in the Middle East. Now, the most grotesque manifestation of radical Islam to date has its eyes deadlocked on the West.

In the two and a half years since the Obama administration began countering ISIS, details on how to counter the bloodthirsty group are still vague at best, and further complicated by the mass exodus of Muslim refugees pouring into Europe. In this country, Obama’s foreign policy has excelled in pressing our government and media elites to deflect a real conversation about jihadist violence to emphasize a fictional narrative full of politically correct shibboleths, from non-existent “Islamophobic” backlashes to a context-less understanding of the Crusades.

Meanwhile, European leaders try their best to ignore the consequences of decades of apologetic politics, including the backlash from German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s recent open-door policy that accepted 1 million refugees, no questions asked. In a twenty-first-century world softened through pseudo-intellectualism, the most devastating enemy since Nazi Germany has left global leadership confused and overwhelmed.

Yet ours is not an impossible task. We can rely on the past as a guide through this defining moment in history. Although it was aimed at domestic policy, when President Franklin Roosevelt outlined his four freedoms in January 1941, he was making an equally strong case against the totalitarianisms that were on the march across the world—totalitarian regimes the United States would be facing before the bloody conclusion of that year. He outlined freedom of speech, the freedom of worship, the freedom from want, and the freedom from fear as symbolic aims that would come to chart America’s course through World War II.

America knew what it stood for then; the same can’t be said in today’s muddled “War on Terror.” But rather than caricaturizing everyone we don’t agree with as a Nazi, the default social stigma of the hour, we can see how Allied powers worked with language, ideology, alliances, and geography to counter Axis powers, and we can weaponize these tools to defeat an enemy more dangerous than Nazi Germany.

Reclaim the Power of Clear Language

World War II gave us clear definitions that distinguished Allied forces from the nations that fell under Axis powers. Americans understood the harsh judgments embedded in shorthand of Vichy France and Norway under Quisling. Today, we lack clear boundaries. We’re confounded by multiple extremist groups, Islamist organizations, crumbling nation-states in the Middle East, Arab lobbies, and a host of other players who are not easily recognized. America is also grappling with a politically correct environment stemming from a desire to elevate dialogue in pursuit of higher ideals.

Naming the problem is the single most important step in psychological power over radical Islam.

Yet the highest ideal today is no different from the highest ideal over 70 years ago: freedom. Securing that freedom requires every man, woman, child, and elected leader once again unite against a common enemy. To do this, we absolutely must be comfortable with naming the enemy: radical Islam.

Naming a thing is an incredibly powerful act that grants dominion. Whether it’s the naming of animals in the biblical book of Genesis, the power that comes with knowledge of a name in the Old Testament, or even awareness of a thing through knowing its name, identification is instrumental to understanding. Naming the problem is the single most important step in psychological power over radical Islam. It’s also key to driving policy-based solutions.

Being able to say “Islamic extremism” or “radical Islam” or “jihad” without fear of backlash is what it’s going to take to get America on the same page. Being on the same page means recognizing that Islam birthed this “radical” interpretation of faith more than 1,400 years ago, and stands today as the ultimate threat to a free world—greater than any threat posed by a fleeting moment in time that gave rise to Adolf Hitler. We didn’t hesitate to call a thing by its name 70 years ago, and we cannot hesitate now.

As a society, this is going to require a hard psychological reset that wipes out political correctness. A crippling PC culture devastates a civilization’s ability to move forward. If we’re going to move forward in this war on terror, then we also need to fall into ranks and recognize we’re dealing with more than just terror.

Combat the Ideology Head-On

While the Third Reich was a politically driven machine that relied on belief in National Socialism, it’s well known that Adolf Hitler was also heavily influenced by the occult. Whether the war is seen through Hitler’s occultist motivations or in the more common thread of a totalitarian ideology, the fact is that Allied forces fully accepted they were battling an ideology that believed in a greater force.

Allied forces fully accepted they were battling an ideology that believed in a greater force.

Yet very few people today can engage in a conversation about the ideological motivations of jihadis, choosing instead to pin the blame on “extreme interpretations of scripture,” economic devastation, or retaliation against Western foreign policy. While any of these three are factors, the driver today is no different than it was over two generations ago. As before, it comes down to belief systems.

But twenty-first-century societies have a hard time accepting religious ideology as a driver in a larger war due to a growing displacement from faith and religion. In the West, there’s a sense of estrangement that lingers in the air; purpose and meaning are lost when everything is secured through the push of a button. Our relationships are transactional, and the only god most of us worship is at the other end of a selfie stick. So it becomes difficult to understand how jihadis and Islamists could have enough belief in an ideology to the point of self-sacrifice.

Meanwhile, the label “Nazi” is freely pressed upon conservative viewpoints, while failing to see how real extremism in the form of radical Islam desires to completely obliterate any oppositional view. So while we’re squabbling over who is the most unfair, radical Islam is looking to destroy us all equally.

The only real and permanent solution is rising to meet an ideology with an even more powerful ideology.

This is still a stretch of the imagination for those who cannot see how modern history’s most notorious villain, Adolf Hitler, is anything like the self-appointed caliphate of ISIS. William L. Shirer in “Rise and Fall of the Third Reich” shows us how: “[Hitler] was twenty-four and to everyone except himself he must have seemed a total failure. He had not become a painter, nor an architect. He had become nothing, so far as anyone could see, but a vagabond – an eccentric, bookish one, to be sure. He had no friends, no family, no job, no home. He had, however, one thing: an unquenchable confidence in himself and a deep, burning sense of mission.”

This is the same conviction found in the innumerable thousands of Muslim extremists who hold the same deep, burning sense of mission, and among Islamists who are aligned in radical philosophy with their jihadi counterparts. At the center of our generational struggle, we have a faith-driven ideology surfacing from the darkest hour in Islam, one that has branded its followers with a sense of infallible destiny. The only real and permanent solution is rising to meet an ideology with an even more powerful ideology, within and outside of Islam.

Make Alliances with Moderate Islam

In recent months, France and Belgium were united in their common cause to apprehend terrorists behind the Paris attacks. Belgium is also part of an international coalition against the Islamic State. In fact, in response to every attack against a Western state, the whole free world comes together in a show of empathy.

There is no central alliance created to tackling the root cause of this ideological problem.

Leaders promise action, national monuments light up, Facebook default pictures change to flags and peace signs, and hashtags and drawings fill social media. And nothing changes beyond having pacified a momentary sense of duty. Nothing changes because we haven’t named the problem; we still deny an ideological war; and we haven’t formed strategic and necessary alliances.

In WWII, a collection of nations came together committed to thwarting the spread of Nazism. Today, we have countries that are banding together, even working together to thwart terrorism—but there is no central alliance created to tackling the root cause of this ideological problem. Quite ironically, some of us are sitting across the table from the enemy.

The War on Terror launched on October 7, 2001, directing its first strike against the Taliban in Afghanistan. Nearly 16 years later, the United States is now negotiating with the Taliban and Al-Qaeda is the lesser evil compared to the new strain of religious extremism in ISIS. Alliances are clearly blurred, but we’re losing the war because we’re engaged in the wrong kind of alliances.

The right kind of alliances look to history first. Islamic fanaticism was kept at bay when Islam’s rational thinkers, the Mu’tazilites, had total political support. Sufi Muslims, Islam’s mystical branch, are also historically powerful players in moderating the field. Newer alliances include modern-day outliers including Muslim reformists and futurists.

This is where we take a page from history and look to see who holds the same views as us, building from it a hybrid new allied force that goes beyond traditional powers. A problem born of faith needs first and foremost people of the faith. Secondly, it needs individuals who can understand that there won’t be a heroic landing on the coast of Normandy. Our D-Day is at least a generation away.

Recognize a Scattered Geographic Playing Field

Wars in the last century were geographically recognizable. Today, no such clarity exists. Paris attacker Salah Abdeslam is a Belgian-born French citizen of Moroccan ancestry. At least one of the terrorists killed in the Paris attacks was suspected to be a refugee of unknown origin; it would be near-impossible and highly-resource intensive to verify passport documents. The San Bernardino shooters were self-radicalized Pakistanis. Last week, a New York pizzeria owner and a naturalized U.S. citizen from Yemen was sentenced for recruiting for the Islamic State.

It is ultimately a war of ideas and the battlefield is the mind.

Today’s enemies don’t wear a uniform. They don’t have distinguishable accents or a unified language. They don’t have the same country of origin. In fact, there is nothing that unifies them beyond radical Islamic ideology.

This means the battle isn’t just an issue with ISIS, which has become the predominant focus of most leaders and public opinion. Radical Islamic terrorism isn’t going to end with taking the fight over there; there is no “over there,” or playing whack-a-mole, a fact that Brussels has already conceded to, admitting it is being challenged in tracking radicals. The war is taking place multiple fronts and in several forms. It is ultimately a war of ideas and the battlefield is the mind.

Winning this war is going to take leadership that can recognize and advocate for the four frames: language, ideology, alliances, and geography. We’re going to need leaders who can bring together a team of outliers who are unafraid of being disliked, because the choices that need to be made are going to be unfavorable—and we need the same caliber of character with iron resolve as in generations past. Nothing less will suffice if we want to win this.

Europe Needs To Get Serious About Radical Islam,"The latest news out of Brussels shows that Europe is not prepared to deal with radical Islam in its cities or ISIS cells across the continent. It also shows that to stop radical Islamic terrorism, Europeans will have to confront the contradictions at the heart of the European project.

The reported failures of Belgium’s intelligence agencies to date have been appalling. But given the country’s byzantine legal system and lax security, they have hardly been surprising. The latest news, however, is shocking. It appears the Brussels attacks might have been carried out by the same ISIS cell that struck Paris in November.

A Belgian judge in charge of the investigation into the Paris attacks issued an arrest warrant in December for Khalid el-Bakraoui, who blew himself up at a subway station near EU headquarters on Tuesday. Another man, Najim Laachraoui, may have built the explosive vests used last year in Paris. He was the second man who blew himself up Tuesday at the Brussels airport.

This news comes with the revelation that el-Bakraoui’s brother, Ibrahim, who also blew himself up at the airport, was detained in Turkey last summer and deported to the Netherlands with a warning to Belgian officials that he was a foreign terrorist fighter. Belgium did nothing, and allowed him back into the country. On Thursday, Koen Geens, Belgium’s justice minister, told reporters he had no idea that el-Bakraoui had been deported by Turkey.

European Security Measures Are Inadequate

The incompetence of Belgian officialdom would be comical if it hadn’t turned out to be so deadly. It’s not like they didn’t have time to put security measures in place. Days after the Paris attacks in November, the government announced 18 counterterrorism measures to improve security, like the ability to tap the phones of radical imams or allow 24-hour house searches in terrorism investigations. (One of the reasons authorities believe Salah Abdeslam, one of the suspected Paris attackers, slipped through a security net is because Belgian law prohibits house searches between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. He hid in Brussels for four months before he was caught last week.)

If a single ISIS cell in Belgium can pull off attacks in Paris and Brussels, imagine what hundreds of cells across the continent could do.

But even if the measures pass it’s doubtful any of it will go far enough. European countries like Belgium will have to change how they think about isolated Muslim communities—and how they think about European society at large. That appears to be the one thing they aren’t prepared to do.

Johan Verbeke, Belgium’s ambassador to the United States, on Thursday told NPR that Belgium is “an extremely open country” that will not “close its windows to the world because it’s not in our mindset. We live as world citizens and we are not going to change our lives because a bunch of terrorists are making our life difficult.”

That’s a fine sentiment, but it doesn’t do much for the people killed in Tuesday’s attacks, or the Paris attacks, or their families, or the people who will die in future attacks. Europe now faces a reckoning. Some 5,000 EU citizens have traveled to Syria to join ISIS. When ISIS is eventually deprived of territory, it will change its tactics.

Since ISIS has already shown that targeting Europe is a strategic priority, you can imagine what it might do in response to territorial losses in Syria and Iraq: send European fighters home to wage jihad in Europe. Some reports indicate hundreds have already come back. If a single ISIS cell in Belgium can pull off attacks in Paris and Brussels, imagine what hundreds of cells across the continent could do.

Some 5,000 EU citizens have traveled to Syria to join ISIS. When ISIS is eventually deprived of territory, it will change its tactics.

In the near-term, European authorities must implement the kinds of old-school police measures adopted by the New York City Police Department in 2003, like surveillance and undercover agents. Those methods might be hard for some Americans to stomach, as Sen Ted Cruz found out this week when he called for the need to “empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslims neighborhoods before they become radicalized.”

But, as David Marcus noted, NYPD’s methods were both legal and successful—and in fact they were the same tactics used to take down the Mafia in the 1970s and ‘80s. That’s the approach European countries will have to take if they want to stop terror attacks in the coming years. They’ll need Muslim Donnie Brascos.

Is the European Union a State, Or Not?

But that won’t be enough. In the long term, European leaders will have to admit not only the scale of the threat they face, but that they themselves created the threat by turning a blind eye to radical Islam lurking in unassimilated Muslim neighborhoods.

Europe faces not just the threat of terrorism, but a kind of simmering insurgency.

Since the end of the Cold War, European leaders have convinced themselves that there’s no need to invest in security because all major world conflicts have been resolved. They are done with history, all that remains is to perfect the welfare state. The truth is that Europe faces not just the threat of terrorism, but a kind of simmering insurgency. And there are no easy, or perhaps even tolerable, solutions.

One way or another, Europe will have to confront a question it has been avoiding for more than a generation: is the EU a state, or not? If so, it must begin acting like one, with all the attendant coordination of security services and immigration policies you would expect from a large state. If not, then individual European countries will have to figure out how to deal with what amounts to radical Islamic insurgencies in their cities.

That is something to fear, and not just because of terrorism itself. Europe has a long and bloody history of putting down insurgencies, and it would be a grave mistake for Europe’s leaders to assume they couldn’t repeat that past.

How Brussels Will Affect The U.S. Presidential Race,"On Tuesday morning, explosions at the Zaventem airport and the Maelbeek metro station in Brussels, Belgium, killed more than 30 people and wounded more than 200 more. Hours later, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks, which marked the group’s second massive-scale terrorist offensive since last November’s attacks in Paris, France.

What impact can we expect the Brussels attacks to have on our presidential primaries? To investigate, let’s first consider how similar attacks in Paris affected the race late last year.

This first chart compares polling done prior to Paris with polling done after Paris. Specifically, it looks at pollsters who conducted polls both before and after, but only within a 30-day period in either direction.

Every single comparison showed at least a five-point bump for Donald Trump, with four of the six pollsters profiled registering a bump in double-digit territory. That’s a remarkable turnaround. But within a 30-day period there were more than just six polls conducted. The above chart looks at six in order to give a sampling. Let’s look at them all.

The Paris attacks, which took place on November 13, represented a pivotal event for Trump, enabling him to reclaim the polling lead he enjoyed prior to Ben Carson’s surge in mid-to-late October. We see a clear upswing for Trump post-Paris. In the above chart, you can hover over each data point to see Trump’s lead (or deficit) in each individual poll, the whole series of which are arranged chronologically. I look at 11 polls done in the 30 days prior to Paris, and 11 polls done in the 30 days after. The results show that Paris correlated with a significant positive effect for Trump’s candidacy.

The Attacks Also Shifted the Debates

In addition to polling, we can take a look at what preoccupied the Republican Party before and after Paris by tallying up the amount of times “ISIS,” “Islam” (and its cognates), and “terror” (and its cognates) were uttered in the Republican debates. What do we find?

In the October and November debates, which took place prior to Paris, these issues were not front and center; in the December debate, they most certainly were. In the above graph, you can click on each term to see how many times it was uttered in each of the three debates (the October debate had zero mentions of the latter two terms).

The October 28 debate was the infamous CNBC debacle, and the three terms received three measly mentions, combined. The November debate, which took place just three days before the Paris attacks, contained 20 total mentions. Admittedly, the November debate was focused on economic questions; after all, it was hosted by Fox Business News in combination with The Wall Street Journal.

Yet both of these outlets regularly provide commentary on foreign policy, so it’s not as if the low mentions can be entirely explained by considering the night’s overriding focus. The December debate, which took place a month after Paris and focused on foreign policy, produced 232 mentions of these terms. It’s clear that Paris intensified interest in discussing Islamic terrorism, at least on the Republican side.

We can also see that the Google search interest for these terms was greatest around the middle of November, in the immediate aftermath of the Paris attacks. The following graph filters out any searches not done on American soil.



Effects on Trump Versus Carson and Cruz

Although this is hardly surprising, I include it in order to investigate what about Trump caused his numbers to go up in response to Paris. Perhaps Trump’s rise had less to do with Trump and more to do with who his chief opponent was at the time: Carson. Indeed, around that time reports had surfaced about Carson’s ongoing struggles with grasping the intricacies of American foreign policy concerns. His own foreign policy advisors were publicly announcing Carson’s deficiencies in this area.

There’s no evidence that in the aftermath of the Brussels attacks, Ted Cruz, who is currently Trump’s biggest rival, will see his numbers go down the way Carson’s did back in November. When we look at exit polling data from CNN, it shows voters who prioritize “terrorism” as the most important issue in this election rate Cruz very highly.

In my five-state sample, I make sure to include the first three contests in order to not skew the results against Carson, who after February was even less competitive than he was initially. Cruz does better than Trump in Iowa, gets blown out in New Hampshire, stays competitive in South Carolina, matches Trump in Oklahoma, and stays right on his trail in Illinois. The point isn’t necessarily to show how Carson’s numbers are low in comparison to Cruz’s, but to show how Cruz is very competitive with Trump on the issue of being tough on terrorism, according to the voters.

Extreme Responses to Extreme Actions Seem to Work

But let’s assume that Trump’s November rise wasn’t just due to an underwhelming rival in Carson but also due to Trump’s own abilities to generate support as a strong leader. Yet it’s not clear that the Paris event itself, as opposed to related but separate concerns that emerged out of it, was responsible for Trump’s reemergence as the clear leader in the national polls.

It’s likely that these positions played a major role in Trump solidifying his status as GOP front-runner.

Consider that Trump used the Paris attacks to introduce a series of escalating anti-immigration ideas, beginning with a call to ban Syrian refugees from entering the country (November 17), a promise to monitor mosques using law enforcement surveillance and to re-implement waterboarding as an interrogation tactic (November 22), and finally to ban all Muslims from entering the country (December 8). It’s likely that these positions played a major role in Trump solidifying his status as GOP front-runner.

The Paris attacks gave him the opportunity to apply his anti-immigrant platform, and he did, which means the attacks themselves weren’t responsible for his rise, strictly speaking. This is a subtle but important consideration, since it suggests he may not see a bump in response to the Brussels attacks unless he finds a way to harness them into an inspiring (well, inspiring to fearful voters) anti-immigrant message.

The problem is that while in November the Syrian refugee crisis was a prominent news item, there is nothing of comparative newsworthiness going on today in that same category. The question of whether to embrace Syrian refugees has largely receded from the current news cycle. This means whatever Trump says in response to Brussels might come across as contrived, or at any rate less inspirational to some Republican voters, than what he said late last year proved to be.

In Destabilizing Times, People Seek Leaders

Of course, it’s hard to use the data we have to confidently predict what will occur going forward. This is not due to a deficiency in the data, but rather due to the nature of the 2016 elections. A 2001-2004 study by the sociologist Robb Willer found that government-issued terror warnings generated a bump in support for the president. Willer’s conclusion is that “fear of external attacks leads to increased support for standing leaders.” Yet the 2016 race doesn’t have an incumbent running.

What makes all of this hard to apply to this year’s race is that it’s unclear what sort of leadership voters will prefer.

In a 2009 study, political scientists Jennifer L. Merolla and Elizabeth J. Zechmeister found that terror threats cause voters to weight leadership into their decision more heavily than they would during “good times,” defined as a period characterizable by “positive indicators about the economy, health, and the environment.” Terror can even destabilize, the same researchers find in a later study, the stability of democracy within a regime and can erode confidence in democratic norms among a citizenry.

But what makes all of this hard to apply to this year’s race is that it’s unclear what sort of leadership voters will prefer: Trump’s corporate leadership combined with a rhetorical strategy that eschews political correctness and evokes nationalistic fervor? Or Hillary Clinton’s executive leadership combined with a rhetorical strategy aimed at avoiding inflaming hostilities between us and the broader Muslim world? Or can Cruz, whose numbers on terrorism are solid, emerge to rally the “strong leadership” vote then bury Clinton with her record of foreign policy missteps?

We will have to wait to find out.

"No, We Haven’t Hit A New Low In Political Discourse","Some have said Donald Trump’s decision to attack Heidi Cruz, the wife of Sen. Ted Cruz, on Twitter marks a new low in a campaign marked by the lowest level of political discourse in American politics ever.

Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!



— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2016

Pic of your wife not from us. Donald, if you try to attack Heidi, you're more of a coward than I thought. #classless https://t.co/0QpKSnjgnE



— Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) March 23, 2016

Donald, real men don't attack women. Your wife is lovely, and Heidi is the love of my life. https://t.co/pprXhIMzUT



— Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) March 24, 2016



Even before Trump and Cruz got into a Twitter spat over one another’s wives, comedian Stephen Colbert asserted Trump’s comments about his private parts at the GOP debate in Detroit, Michigan, showed political discourse was now buried lower than the dinosaurs.

“For those of you that have been following American democracy for the past 240 years, we have officially hit a new low,” he said.

The level of discourse, which at one point The New York Times called a “war of playground insults,” is certainly at a saddeningly low level. What American wants the people vying to be our next president going around insulting competitors’ hair, reporters’ menstrual cycles, or the attractiveness of one another’s wives?

What American wants the people vying to be our next president going around insulting competitors’ hair or wives?

It was a high point in the 2008 presidential campaign when then-Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama said discussion of Bristol Palin’s pregnancy, daughter of then-Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was off-limits.

“Let me be as clear as possible,” Obama said. “I think people’s families are off-limits, and people’s children are especially off-limits. This shouldn’t be part of our politics.”

But even if we believe that the political discourse of this election is unacceptable—especially if compared to the last few presidential elections—we’re ignoring the strident and even violent discourse of the past. Anyone who has paid attention to the past 240 years of American government would know that political discourse in America actually hasn’t hit a new low. Historically, American politics have been even more rancorous than they are today.

Slash and Burn Politics Is Not at All Unprecedented

Much has been said about the Make America Awesome PAC’s decision to run an ad with a naked photo of Trump’s wife, Melania, aimed at dissuading Mormons in Utah from voting for Trump in the Republican primary last Tuesday. But has everyone forgotten that the Reynolds affair in the second act of the Broadway smash-hit “Hamilton” actually happened?

Has everyone forgotten that the Reynolds affair in the second act of the Broadway smash-hit ‘Hamilton’ actually happened?

Personal attacks of the most private nature have been a part of American politics since the founding of our republic. In 1797, sitting Vice President Thomas Jefferson spread rumors about former Secretary of Treasury Alexander Hamilton’s nine-month affair with Maria Reynolds, and later that year journalist and pamphleteer James Callender got a hold of private letters between Hamilton and Reynolds and published them in a pamphlet about Hamilton’s affair.

Many Americans were shocked by the scandal, and Hamilton was furious and embarrassed. Hamilton ended up apologizing for his actions, but his reputation was damaged. Later, when then-president Jefferson denied Callender an appointment as postmaster, he printed information of Jefferson’s alleged affair with Sally Hemings.

In 1856, a couple of days after Massachusetts Sen. Charles Sumner gave an impassioned speech against expanding slavery, he was beaten unconscious on the Senate floor by South Carolina Rep. Preston Brooks. In the speech that provoked the attack, Sumner had called a fellow senator, Democrat Stephen Douglas of Illinois, a “noise-some, squat, and nameless animal.”

During the presidential election of 1920, an opponent accused Republican nominee Warren G. Harding of being one-sixteenth black. At the time this claim was a major insult, and Harding’s campaign manager responded that Harding was “a blue-eyed stock from New England and Pennsylvania, the finest pioneer blood.”

In 1964, Democratic presidential incumbent Lyndon B. Johnson ran ads associating Republican nominee Barry Goldwater with the Ku Klux Klan, even while Goldwater publicly condemned the group.

It’s Possible to Govern Well Amid Rhetorical Gunfire

The level of political discourse has certainly been low this election, even depressingly so. And no generation should accept the ad hominem and even violent attacks candidates make during an election cycle. But we can’t say there is anything “new” about this low. It’s just the present low in an American political history filled with lows.

It a problem with people not only forgetting their history, but also losing sight of decency.

This isn’t a Republicans or Democrats problem, either. It a problem with people not only forgetting their history, but also losing sight of decency. Instead of forgetting our history, let’s learn from it. Personal attacks will never be acceptable political discourse, yet they will probably never going to go away. We should look past them and attempt prudent governance anyway.

American discourse at the time of the drafting of the Constitution was just as strident as it is today, yet America’s founding fathers produced the best constitution the world had ever seen. Hopefully we can learn from our founding fathers and govern effectively in spite of the poisonous rhetoric of this election.

"On Easter, Terrorists Bomb Christian Children In Pakistan","Yesterday, as America’s Christians went to church and sat down with family and friends to celebrate Christ’s defeat of death, tragedy struck our community in Pakistan. Islamic terrorists detonated a bomb at an amusement park in Lahore that killed 70 people and injured more than 300. According to a Pakistani Taliban spokesperson, they “claim responsibility for the attack on Christians as they were celebrating Easter.”

Many of the dead are women and children guilty of nothing more than sharing a faith with so many of us in the United States. But while Americans mourn, fear, and post on social media about attacks in Paris and Brussels, attacks like yesterday’s fly under the radar. They are treated as the natural course of things in territories on fire.

But they are not. They are a careful and constructed attack on Christianity. As such, they are a direct attack on us all.

There But for The Grace of God

Most Christians in the United States are shy about public professions of faith. For every follower of Christ who vocally fights for “Merry Christmas” over “Happy Holidays,” dozens simply keep their head down and practice their religion. This is understandable. Christianity, although by no means the official religion of the United States, has been the dominant religious force throughout its history. It is a good thing America’s Christians are sensitive to that dominant status.

But it is equally important for us to understand that this status is not universal. There are places in the world, including Lahore, where being a Christian can and does get people killed. While they might not look like us or talk like us, as Jesus taught us, they are us. He taught us that what we do unto the least of his, we do unto him.

I’m not sure if Pakistani Christians are the least of his, but frankly they risk a lot more in his name than we do. Ether way, how we treat them and react to their persecution is a test.

Deliver Us from Evil

In our modern English translation of the Lord’s Prayer, we pray that our Father not “lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil.” In the original Greek, the word we translate as temptation has a broader meaning. It also means a “test.” We are asking the Lord not to test us. But as with the other things asked of God in this prayer—our daily bread, forgiveness of trespasses, the ability to forgive others—we don’t always get what we ask for.

Evil is not part of Christ. It is part of us.

We all pray that abominations like the horrific attack on innocents yesterday may never happen. We pray we may not be tested by such horrors. But just as Christ by himself cannot protect us from these tests, he cannot on his own deliver us from evil. Evil is not part of him. It is part of us. Although we seek deliverance from it through him, it is we who must make the journey through.

These are the times when stark images of violence against Christians, although painful, help us. They shake us out of our relativistic musings into the stark revelation that there is evil. We think of our own children, and tremble at the notion that some want to kill them because we teach them to accept Jesus.

We Can Do More for Oppressed Christians

As Bill McMorris at the Washington Free Beacon pointed out, only 1.5 percent of the 2,000 Syrian refugees allowed into the United States as of November of last year were Christian. Syria’s population is 10 percent Christian, almost all of whom exist under dire threat.

Make no mistake: white Christian privilege does not extend to Syria or Pakistan.

Just as many American Christians are shy about outward displays of faith, many are worried about apparent preferential treatment for Christians. As McMorris shows, in this case such fears are unfounded and dangerous. Make no mistake: white Christian privilege does not extend to Syria or Pakistan.

Awkward though it may feel from our cozy confines, we must face and defeat the aggressive destruction of Christian communities around the world. This is a nuanced situation. We know the vast majority of Muslims would never commit such an act, and do not believe their religion condones such acts.

Atheist activists are wont to remind us of brutal passages in our own Old Testament, and even in the New Testament. So we understand the subtleties at work, and we can face this threat without painting with too broad a brush.

But we must face this concern. We must accept this test. Through our churches, our petitions to our government, and even our votes, we must insist that the persecution of Christians be treated as a unique and deadly phenomenon.

The Complexity of Tribalism

Attacks on white Europeans dominate our headlines for very tribal reasons. We see ourselves more closely resembled in their faces. Just as pretty white women who go missing get much more coverage than minority kidnapping victims at home, pretty Parisians that terrorists kill get more attention than murdered exotic brown people do. This is true for complicated and discomfiting reasons that we must struggle with and better understand.

The more deeply and broadly we consider ourselves, the bigger the tent of our empathy and spirit of brotherhood becomes.

One step in such understanding is to remember that most of the world’s Christians do not look alike. If Europe, through its cultural and class ties, resembles us, so do the countless third-world Christian communities around the globe. This latter resemblance is very deep. It is a shared understanding of right of wrong. It is a commitment to live by a set of moral standards that apply equally, to everyone, and which we ourselves did not create.

We are tribal, but we are of many tribes. It is only when we define ourselves in superficial ways that we find a primary commonality based on superficial similarities. The more deeply and broadly we consider ourselves, the bigger the tent of our empathy and spirit of brotherhood becomes. Eventually it can contain almost everyone as a member of our tribe. Almost.

Call Evil by Its Name

Christian charity may demand that we pray for the soul of a person who straps a bomb on himself and walks into an amusement park to kill and maim children. But the Christian faith also demands that we recognize the existence of evil. The late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia drew mocking scorn from many when he said he believed in the devil — not as an abstraction, but as a figure in the universe as distinct as God.

Evil is a more difficult enemy than Islam. But it, not the religion of Mohammad, is our true enemy.

Such ideas are not fashionable. Surely attacks like the one in Lahore can be understood, if only we try hard enough to walk a mile in their suicide-bomb vest.

Such actions can and have been understood. They are evil. They are not the tragic result of Donald Rumsfeld’s failed policies, they are not the natural result of centuries of colonialism, they are not the deserved result of a history of Christendom replete with terror and murder. They are simply evil.

Evil is a more difficult enemy than Islam. But it, not the religion of Mohammad, is our true enemy. No walls can stop it. It respects no borders. It resides in all of us. The rejection and suppression of evil is why the religious pray and why the non-religious study. But where and when evil thrives until it twists men into murdering children, we must see it for what it is. We must not be too afraid, in the recognition of our own sins, failings, or privileges to destroy it.

Those of us who celebrated Christ’s resurrection yesterday mourn and pray for the victims of this terrible attack. But we must do more. Even as we feel our culture pulling away from us, becoming less accepting of our beliefs, we must use our freedom to protect Christians everywhere. For, as Christ teaches us, it is in protecting others that we find protection for ourselves.

Ann Coulter Worries Donald Trump Is Mental,"On Face the Nation on Sunday, I argued that prior to the past week, Donald Trump had made just one tactical mistake: skipping the last debate before Iowa. This past week they made two: failing to grasp the importance of delegate operations and engaging in a misguided and unnecessary attack on Heidi Cruz.

The former is the bigger mistake: the Cruz delegate operation is forcing Trump to get to the delegate majority by working to ensure in states like Louisiana and elsewhere that Trump could lose on a second ballot. In the context of checks and balances, the arcane nomination is yet another way the institutions protect themselves and the people from demagogues and hucksters. Trump’s response has been a typical one: threaten lawsuits over the lost Louisiana delegates. But that won’t amount to much. And actually, should he prevail in decertifying Louisiana’s results, it would lead to fewer delegates for himself, and he’d still have to get to 1,237. Sad!

But the latter mistake speaks to Trump’s personality, and his inability at this stage to become a unifying figure without reversing course – just listen to what happens when Trump gets asked real questions by Charlie Sykes, and the degree to which he falls back on his typical attacks even in the face of demands for evidence not in existence.

At exactly the moment Trump ought to be transforming himself into a unifying figure, he is ensuring that is all the more difficult by stooping to baseless personal attacks and driving down his numbers among Republican women and social conservatives. In failing to recognize the importance of delegates and in engaging in these unnecessary personal attacks, Trump decreases his potential to win the nomination on the first ballot. If Trump is actually beaten because of these decisions it shows he’s not ready to lead a party anyway.

Coulter is a lot of things, but she’s no dummy. She understands that by politicizing Heidi Cruz’s depression and her appearance, Trump is hurting his ability to ever receive the support of a growing portion of Republican women.

And lest you think this is just typical anti-Trump tendency, listen to his supporters: Ann Coulter, a more dedicated Trump defender than any, is getting frustrated with Trump for his late night Twitter shenanigans:

“I’m a little testy with our man right now. Our candidate is mental! Do you realize our candidate is mental?” Coulter said jokingly during a taping of an episode of the “Milo Yiannopoulos Show,” which is scheduled to air in full this weekend. “It’s like constantly having to bail out your 16-year-old son from prison.”



“For Coulter, Trump’s attacks on Cruz’s wife may have crossed a line, and she wished he, “would be a teensy bit less low-brow.” “This is the worst thing that he has done,” she said as her host laughed. “Everything else I could probably defend.”

The hilarious but occasionally terrifying Yiannopoulos, who Kevin Williamson described as having “done more to put homosexual camp in the service of right-wing authoritarianism than any man has since the fellows at Hugo Boss sewed all those nifty SS uniforms”, disagreed, defending the man he calls “Daddy”.

“The trashier he gets, the more I love him!” the host said. “I think it’s so outrageously funny. People are so sick of earnest pearl-clutching from the establishment. A presidential candidate — and not just a presidential candidate, but somebody who’s probably going to get the nomination is saying ‘you’re wife’s ugly and my wife’s hot’ — I think that’s amazing. It may not scream ‘presidential material…’ But some people are going to think ‘what a boss!’”



“Coulter responded, saying, “You know, I love him so much on immigration I’m not even going to argue with you. I say low-brow, you say amazing … Let’s just talk about what he’s good on. He’s the only one who’s going to build a wall, but please stop testing our patience on the rest of this stuff.”

Coulter is a lot of things, but she’s no dummy. She understands that by politicizing Heidi Cruz’s depression and her appearance, Trump is hurting his ability to ever receive the support of a growing portion of Republican women, particularly social conservatives and evangelicals. D.C. McAllister:

One thing I’ve learned through my own struggles with depression is those who don’t suffer from it can’t possibly understand what you’re going through. They think you’re just sad, but it’s so much deeper than that. Only you know the pain in your own heart. The window to your soul is closed to the world. This is why exploiting Cruz’s suffering is so wrong. It cheapens the real struggles of millions of people and exposes the personal pain of a lovely woman who has struggled to overcome a terrible illness and has done it with grace. We should show her, and anyone else wrestling with depression, that same grace.

When your most loyal media supporter is saying you’re mental, low-brow, and that these latest attacks are the worst thing your candidate has done, it should send a message to any normal campaign that you ought to reconsider your course. The acolytes Trump surrounds himself with, however, seem to have little capacity for such reflection. We shall see if they prove me wrong.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/03/29/ann-coulter-worries-donald-trump-is-mental/,2016-03-29
The Intellectual Case For Trump I: Why White Nationalism?,"Donald Trump deserves to be president. More than any of the current candidates—although not to their exclusion—he is the best choice to lead this nation.

This is not an easy position to hold in DC. Having already lost friends of multiple years and having been subjected to practically every hysterical insult you expect people to stop using at the age of 15, I think it’s safe to say that the social pressure so many #NeverTrump people want to bring to bear on Trump supporters has materialized.

Speaking for those same Trump supporters, I also would say that it only hardens our opinions. I have never been so certain of anything as I am now that Trump is the one man who could deliver on a promise to make not just America, but the Republican Party, great again.

However, I owe those railing against me an answer to this question: “Why?”

It’s a valid question, even if those asking it often do so because of bigoted and incorrect assumptions about Trump supporters. Some of our detractors think we’re all old, stupid, kneejerk reactionaries with poor bank accounts and even poorer educations, not to mention total bankruptcy in the realm of conservative principle, if we even knew conservative principles existed. Others think we’re simply unaccomplished, cynical opportunists trying to introduce toxic white identity politics (or worse, white nationalism) into the GOP to feather our own nests while destroying the party.

I’m Not the Trump Caricature You Think I Am

For me, nothing could be further from the truth. I am young, financially secure, and graduated from one of America’s elite liberal arts colleges with strong academic distinctions thanks to a senior thesis attempting to reconstruct Frank Meyer’s fusionism post-George W. Bush. I once vocally supported the Gang of Eight immigration bill, and my employers since leaving college have included National Review, the Senate GOP leadership, the Washington Times, Glenn Beck, and former Republican Party Web Director and anti-Trump gadfly Liz Mair, none of whom could be accused of being either fringe or unprincipled.

Trump’s capacity to adopt the posture of a strongman is an asset in dealing with illiberal foreign regimes, which generally view the heads of Western liberal democracies as easy dupes and empty suits.

My resume needs no help, and without going into detail, it would probably be far better for me from a career standpoint if I had backed Ted Cruz this entire time. However, deciding who to support for president isn’t about me. It’s about what’s best for the country and for the Republican Party. Trump is both.

How can I say that? I could make the standard boilerplate argument about qualifications for the job. After all, Trump is probably the most accomplished man in recent history to make a run at the presidency. He has built an international business empire that is instantly identifiable. Furthermore, unlike Mitt Romney, whose business experience was arguably difficult to transfer into the realm of politics, the specific type of business Trump does has required him to work with everyone from local politicians to foreign heads of state in order to succeed. The man knows his way around finessing politicians probably as much as some diplomats do, and, given the president’s responsibility to represent America to the world, this experience is invaluable.

Furthermore, Trump’s capacity to adopt the posture of a strongman is an asset in dealing with illiberal foreign regimes, which generally view the heads of Western liberal democracies as easy dupes and empty suits. Trump’s presentational style is a type of politician they recognize, and I daresay one they will respect more easily.

Or, I could talk about Trump’s great personal virtues. Yes, I said personal virtues. For while it has become de rigeur among conservatives to sneer at Trump as a man who personifies the opposite of family values, I submit that the evidence of Trump’s character as a family man and father is not only irrefutable: it literally stands beside him every time he wins a primary. I’m talking, of course, about Ivanka, Eric, and Donald Jr. Any parent who had raised even one child to turn out as well as any of those three adults would have cause to beam with pride. To have raised all three is simply mind-boggling.

Whatever Trump’s flaws as a spouse—and to be sure, they exist—we should all be so lucky as to have a father like him. In fact, one of the filthiest and most transparently dishonest memes to have emerged from this election is the image of Trump as a leering incestuous molester because of some (admittedly cringe-worthy) comments he made about Ivanka. However, if Trump was crawling into his daughter’s bed to molest her, let’s just say Ivanka doesn’t seem to have noticed and leave this disgusting smear in the trash where it belongs.

The First Part of the Intellectual Case for Donald Trump

However, convincing as I do think these arguments are, there is a conspicuous absence of a third case, which one usually sees being made for presumptive GOP nominees (and whatever the denialists say, yes, Trump is the presumptive GOP nominee now) at this point in their run—i.e., to my knowledge, no one has yet made an intellectual case for Trump.

No one has marshaled philosophical, practical, and principled arguments in defense of the idea that thinking people who care about such things should, without any compromise of their own critical faculties, decide that Trump is the man to lead America.

Make no mistake, it is not an easy case to make, not because there are no arguments for it, but because you can’t meaningfully separate Trump from the numerous other cultural and historical phenomena that gave rise to his candidacy, many of which are far from obvious without being exposited. However, at its most basic, that case will advance three arguments:

That Trump, alone among the candidates, is forcing conservatives to defend the people left behind by liberalism, however unfashionable they may be, and however culturally alien they may have once been to our movement. That Trump’s candidacy is about more than one man becoming president: it is symbolic of a national cultural Zeitgeist, and speaks to the modern political moment, in ways that no other candidate has been willing or able to do. That Trump’s candidacy is the only tonic that can cure the conservative movement of its many ills, by forcing it to reckon both with the many ways in which the country has left it behind, and with the damning ways in which it has betrayed itself: in short, that Trump is chemotherapy for the soul of the Right.

Now, the reader can probably tell that this isn’t so much a hard case to make as a big one. When it comes to the first prong, I speak not merely from dusty Ivory Tower pontification, but from actual real-world experience with my subject matter. When I say “the people left behind by liberalism,” I’m not speaking of some abstract demographic category. I’m speaking of actual people whom I really knew, including some of the very people whose attraction to Trump most frightens his critics.

Trump is chemotherapy for the soul of the Right.

For this reason, and also because (being a Trump supporter) I’m not exactly above a little sensationalism, I’m going to start this piece by answering a very uncomfortable question: Why do white nationalists support Trump, if he isn’t one himself?

I’m no white nationalist (in fact, being Jewish, I’m pretty sure I’m disqualified), and I regard the ideology with just as much disgust as I do every other form of radical identity politics. That being said, I do have a fairly unique ability to answer this question, and with apologies to Lloyd Bentsen, it can be summed up this way: I know white nationalism. A white nationalist was a friend of mine. Trump is no white nationalist.

If he’s president, there might well be fewer of them. Why? Well, if you’ll indulge me in just a little more autobiographical navel-gazing, you’ll find out.

The Girl in the Brown Skirt

“Oh God! To hear the Insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dust.” —“A Christmas Carol,” Stave 3: The Second of the Three Spirits

I once met a young woman whom I will call Sylvia, after her favorite poet, Sylvia Plath. At the time, Sylvia had been raised as a member of an infamous white nationalist organization. And I do mean “infamous.” These weren’t the comparatively well-mannered sorts that attend conferences led by Richard Spencer. These were the sorts of people who probably get raided by the FBI.

She was more than happy to enthuse about Pat Buchanan, VDare, and restricting immigration.

Where I met her was probably the last place you might expect to find white nationalists, closeted or otherwise. Now since I am, as already established, Jewish, this obviously made me initially regard the girl with something less than charity. I was almost afraid to speak to her.

That is, until I actually did speak to her, in the company of another friend, who had made it his personal mission to deconvert her from her ideology, a task with which I agreed to help, mostly out of morbid intellectual curiosity. When we first spoke to her, Sylvia was fairly careful with her words, and obviously seemed to realize she wasn’t among company who’d take kindly to open admiration of Adolf Hitler. She was, however, more than happy to enthuse about Pat Buchanan, VDare, and restricting immigration.

Now, at the time, I was fresh off having argued for the Gang of Eight bill until I was proverbially blue in the face, so when Sylvia started talking about immigration, I obviously pounced on this as a first opportunity to break down her worldview. I’m fairly certain that all I managed to do was scare her, though she did actually put up a far better fight than any white nationalist has a right to, probably because, despite her sheltered upbringing, she was off-the-charts brilliant. This instantly registered with me, and was later confirmed when she later revealed she’d learned a new language in only two weeks.

This time with more gentle prodding, I started to make her doubt what she’d been taught.

Over the coming weeks, I continued to send out feelers and message and speak with her online, keeping my ethnic heritage a secret at first so I could probe her ideology without sending up alarm bells. After a while, she got used to me, and we bonded over our mutual love of H.P. Lovecraft and dark internet humor. As a result, she began to open up about her more risqué beliefs. So, this time with more gentle prodding, I started to make her doubt what she’d been taught.

Of course, at some point I had to reveal that I am a Jew. Needless to say, this shocked her, not least of all because apparently her people train their children to recognize Jewish heritage in someone’s features, yet I had registered as pure Aryan. The realization that “they can look like us,” to use her words, set off something of a minor existential crisis for her, but I’m pleased to report that she got over it, and that my ethnic revelation actually made her open up more to me rather than less.

When Two Worlds Collide

That’s because what shocked her even more than my Jewishness was that I’d known she was a white nationalist and still willingly engaged with her like a human being and an equal. From someone who belonged to a group that she’d assumed held nothing but contempt and malice for people like her, this was the last thing she expected. The feeling was mutual on my end.

What shocked her even more than my Jewishness was that I’d known she was a white nationalist and still willingly engaged with her like a human being and an equal.

After that revelation, gently poking holes in her worldview was out of the question, as I’d just metaphorically sent a cannonball straight through its foundation. What happened instead was that, with the scales lifted from both our eyes about the other’s decency and humanity, we started dissecting the other’s culture as it actually existed rather than how we’d been taught to believe it did. To make a very long story short, she came away understanding that my people weren’t intentionally hurting her people, and I came away with an appreciation for how much, and how unfairly, her people really were hurting.

I say “unfairly” for multiple reasons: firstly, because people as brilliant as Sylvia is do not deserve to be written off as incurable white trash. Giving everybody the opportunity to succeed means everybody, even people who were raised in ways we find troubling. One doesn’t have to be willing to offer blanket pardons to the Aryan Brotherhood to see that someone who was merely raised with bad ideas is not necessarily a lost cause, no matter how repellent those ideas are. In fact, lifting people like Sylvia out of circumstances where they think white nationalism is the only solution seems like Americanism at its finest, not a betrayal of the idea.

The other reason I say the pain experienced by Sylvia’s community is unfair is because when you strip away the swastikas, imitation Hugo Boss uniforms, and Klan hoods, there are things that even rabid, clannish white nationalist society does better than our own. Ironically, given their loathing of other cultures, the biggest one is bilingual education.

Lifting people like Sylvia out of circumstances where they think white nationalism is the only solution seems like Americanism at its finest.

One of the odder things I learned was that Sylvia and every other child in her community had to learn to speak German and English, and achieved total fluency in both by their teens. I’m from California, and our own education system wishes it were that good. We don’t have to excuse, or even tolerate, the massive amounts of bad behavior such people engage in to learn from the few decent things they do. After all, just because Mussolini made the trains run on time doesn’t mean punctuality in public transit is itself bad, no matter how hard the DC Metro system pretends.

Ultimately, the biggest reason the pain that drove Sylvia’s family and so many like them into the arms of white nationalism is unfair is a pain that I, as a Jew, can empathize with. After all, once many Jews turned to communism as a way of trying to get political rights they didn’t think they could get any other way, and as a way of lashing out at a society that unfairly disdained them and their culture.

Even though this ideological shift made many people hate Jews more, at least the communists were trying to do something. Only that kind of desperation can make a radical ideology like white nationalism attractive.

Nationalism Is Backlash to Hatred of Western Culture

This brings me to the first and, arguably, the most important lesson that Sylvia taught me about what drives people into the arms of white nationalism: that urge comes not from economic dispossession, nor spiritual dispossession, but cultural dispossession.

The sorts of people who are attracted to white nationalism are people whose own communities have been hollowed out by economic and cultural forces beyond their control.

No, I don’t mean the sort of “where has my country gone” ignorance that I and my fellow coastal cosmopolitans like to mock over cocktails. I mean the sorts of people who are attracted to white nationalism are people whose own communities have been hollowed out by economic and cultural forces beyond their control, and who are now adrift in a society they perceive to be universally hostile to their heritage for no good reason.

That heritage, as white nationalists in America see it, is the heritage of Western civilization. If you wonder what that means (which is reasonable), let me spell it out: It means historically Western European cultural norms. Specifically, norms like respect for agents of the law, aspirational pride in work, willingness to accept the consequences of one’s actions, disdain for laziness and welfarism, and reproductive responsibility (i.e., not having children you can’t afford to keep).

They respect these norms not merely because these are what their own communities follow, but also because they think these norms make constitutional government, liberty, and classical republicanism possible. If you have to pick between the two, defend the norms every day, since temporary cessations of liberty will naturally recover if they’re still in place, whereas the institutions without the norms will become meaningless: the Constitution will become a pointless scrap of paper to which people pay only lip service, and constitutional government will become bureaucracy hiding behind the fig leaf of a separation of powers.

They think these norms make constitutional government, liberty, and classical republicanism possible.

Where this otherwise perfectly respectable, conservative pride in Western culture atrophies into white nationalism when the person holding it comes to believe that respect for liberal Western civilization is inextricably tied to one’s race. One particularly irreverent white nationalist YouTube songster sums this attitude up in a video mocking libertarians: “It’s not that freedom is bad/But only whites think it’s rad.”

Moreover, and this cannot be stated enough: these people genuinely believe that to be proud of the history of Western European accomplishment, and one’s own descent from the people responsible, is taboo in modern America. If you look at what cultural studies departments, much of modern media, left-wing college students, and the crazy wing of the Democratic Party says, this is probably at least partially accurate. Unfortunately, however, it’s not just leftists who are responsible for the rise of white nationalism in communities like Sylvia’s. We conservatives bear some blame too, though in this case, largely because of misunderstandings of how our own behavior is perceived.

The Right Has Also Failed

The biggest problem we have is that many conservatives are, understandably, reluctant to engage with the sort of leftist, victim-culture-spouting loons who regard Western civilization as unrepentantly evil. This is not because we have no good arguments against them; we do. But to argue with them, we think, makes them look more serious and relevant than they are. If you live in the rarefied world of Washington policy debates, this approach probably makes sense and even seems obvious.

If you’re a blue-collar worker being screamed at that you have ‘white privilege,’ you assume conservatives are either ashamed to express our disagreement, or don’t disagree.

But if you’re a blue-collar worker in Appalachia being screamed at by leftist protesters that you have “white privilege” and all you hear from the official Right is stony silence, you come to a wildly different conclusion: you assume conservatives are either ashamed to express our disagreement, or don’t disagree.

Add to this the fact that so much of the official Right’s response to left-wing attacks about diversity involves not denying their premise, but instead pointing to how many token members of each ethnic group are Republicans, or the fact that we’ll throw accusations like “racist” around over issues like immigration, and it gets harder and harder for otherwise conservative people to deny the idea that “conservatism” doesn’t want to conserve them, or the Western values and norms that made conservatism and constitutionalism possible, at all. The only people who do seem to want to man those barricades, from their perspective, are white nationalists.

This is not ground we should be ceding to extremists. Yet, so far, only one candidate has refused to do such a thing: Donald Trump.

Trump, whatever else he might be, is unabashedly pro-Western. What’s more, he understands the essentially cultural and even spiritual nature of the vacuum white nationalism fills. Unlike so many so-called “reformocons,” who wax poetic about the need to empathize with blue-collar workers’ economic concerns, yet are only willing to throw “family-friendly” tax credits at them like table scraps to starving dogs, Trump understands that however besieged people like Sylvia feel by economic woes, they feel even more besieged by attacks on their pride and dignity.

However besieged people like Sylvia feel by economic woes, they feel even more besieged by attacks on their pride and dignity.

Unlike the white nationalists, Trump has defended that pride and dignity without once mentioning race, but instead with reference to the historical reality and promise of uniquely American greatness. His pitch is nationalist, yes, but it is not racist, and so immediately understandable that you can even put it on a baseball cap.

In fact, Trump, and Trump alone, has been willing to say what should have been obvious from the start: that the universalism and Whig historical pretensions of Kemp-and-W-style “bleeding heart conservatism” are dangerous distractions if they leave the American people as wounded prey for anti-American, extremist bottom feeders.

His image of a man fighting for America and its allies, and only them is a long-overdue return to form for a GOP long since captured by delusions of immanentizing the eschaton at the point of a gun. Those delusions have to stop, and Trump has to be allowed to punch through them.

Otherwise, the people damaged by multicultural, leftist attacks on Western civilization will be thoroughly justified in sneering at us as proverbial “cuckservatives” forever mentally masturbating with our own empty universalism while barbarism rapes Lady Liberty.

4 Problems With Obama Censoring ‘Islamist Terrorism’,"It’s no secret that President Obama has refused to use the phrase “Islamist terrorism” to describe Muslim militant groups who do violence in the name of their religion. He took a lot of heat for this linguistic side-stepping during the 2015 summit on “violent extremism” in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks.

This kind of doublespeak refuses to openly acknowledge the Muslim religion, or at least a jihadist interpretation of it, as a motivating factor for terror attacks occurring globally from California and Brussels to Pakistan and Turkey.

But on Thursday, the Obama administration took things one step further. At a meeting between President Obama and French President François Hollande, the latter noted, unremarkably, that the roots of Islamist terrorism are in Syria and Iraq. The official White House video, however, cuts out Hollande’s voice and that of his interpreter when he says “Islamist terrorism” and references a coalition to act in the region.



There are four important things to take away from this brazen attempt to shelter Americans from associating Islam with violence and terrorism.

1. Censorship Is a Slippery Slope

Yes, we’ve seen Obama avoid using the phrase “Islamist terrorism” before, but this goes way beyond any previous attempts to skirt the issue with bland references to “violent extremism.” This is an effort to expel the phrase from the conversation—literally. It’s one thing to refuse to acknowledge the threat oneself, but it is quite another to suppress the speech of a foreign head of state. This is full-blown censorship.

This is an effort to expel the phrase from the conversation—literally.

It feels more like a cautionary tale we read in high school—more like Soviet Russia than the United States. It brings to mind the recently lifted three-year ban of YouTube in Pakistan. The ban was put in place purportedly to “protect” Pakistanis from viewing anything insulting about Islam. The real purpose was to shape the way people think. This is how censorship works.

Of course, this was always going to be the logical conclusion of Obama refusing to call Islamist terrorism by its name. It starts innocently enough, by claiming that it’s meant to spare the feelings of the Muslim community. It ends, inevitably, in censorship. Somewhere down the line, there’ll be a push for hate speech laws. This is why intellectual honesty is so important, and intellectual dishonesty so dangerous. It’s a slippery slope.

2. Ignoring Islam Makes Addressing Terrorism Impossible

Obama staunchly rejects that ISIS, al-Qaeda, or any self-professed Islamist group has anything to do with “real” Islam. One reason for this is the lack of imagination to see that these terrorists, and the communities that support them, actually believe what they’re saying.

Never mind what they themselves say motivates them to commit violence.

It’s assumed that we’ve all “gotten past” religion and that no one could really believe that stuff anymore—we all know now that it’s just nonsense. Rather, these jihadists must be motivated by economic uncertainty, unfair treatment by non-Muslims, and all-around disaffection and cultural disenfranchisement. Never mind what they themselves say motivates them to commit violence.

Obama also seems to reject what most Muslims accept—that there are multiple interpretations of Islam. He treats the religion as a monolithic entity, as though there is only one “true” Islam and the rest are just fringe radicals. He calls them a “tiny faction” within Islam. This ignores the reality that many Muslims in the Middle East adhere to what Obama would call “extreme” interpretations of Islam.

Take Egypt as an example, where 74 percent of Muslims want Sharia law enforced, and of those, more than 80 percent approve of stoning for adultery and the death penalty for leaving Islam. That’s around 47,360,000 people who would stone an adulterer to death in Egypt alone. This is more than a fringe movement.

Obama’s naïveté about the connection between Islam and terrorism is dangerous because we can’t fight an enemy that we won’t even acknowledge.

3. People Notice Obama Doesn’t Take Terrorism Seriously Enough

Censoring a foreign leader’s use of the phrase “Islamist terrorism” is yet more proof that our president is not taking the threat of ISIS seriously enough (see his trip to Cuba during the Brussels attack). He’s much more concerned with being in ideological lock-step with political correctness than he is with acknowledging and combatting the global threat of Islamism.

Maybe if our president hadn’t been so unwilling to speak plainly about Islamism, we wouldn’t be seeing such extreme reactions to it.

This isn’t lost on the American people, or our allies. Imagine if President Reagan had been unwilling to utter the word “communism” during the Cold War, instead calling it “extremism.” This would have seriously undermined his efforts and our allies’ confidence in working with us. It also would have terrified the American people, signaling that their commander-in-chief doesn’t understand the fundamental beliefs that motivated our enemies in the Soviet Union.

It’s no surprise therefore, that so many people are flocking to Donald Trump, who projects strength and is willing to say uncomfortable things. Fifty percent of Americans now agree that non-citizen Muslims should be temporarily denied entrance into the United States, and 45 percent approve of waterboarding in the war on terror, both policies Trump has espoused. Maybe if our president hadn’t been so unwilling to speak plainly about Islamism, we wouldn’t be seeing such extreme reactions to it.

4. Obama Holds Low Expectations for Muslims

Obama’s fears of uttering “Islamism” alongside “terrorism” show his low opinion of people in general, non-Muslims and Muslims alike. On the one hand, he seems to view the American people as unhinged bigots, who, if they hear that Islam is associated with terrorism, will attack the nearest Muslim.

He seems to view the American people as unhinged bigots, who, if they hear that Islam is associated with terrorism, will attack the nearest Muslim.

After every Islamist terrorist attack, we are told that anti-Muslim hate crimes are on the rise. Yet the rate of anti-Muslim hate crime is significantly lower than incidences of anti-Semitism in the United States. Obama underestimates the ability of the American people to handle the reality of Islam’s relationship to terrorism. He should have a little more faith.

Obama also has very low expectations for the Muslim community’s ability to react rationally to hearing world leaders point out that ISIS and their ilk are, in fact, Muslim. In his Atlantic interview with Jeffrey Goldberg, Obama says he doesn’t want to scare off “tolerant Muslims” by painting the issue with a broad brush. They, apparently, are too irrational to discern that linking Islamism and terrorism isn’t a de facto war on the imaginary monolithic Islam. He condescendingly treats them like simple-minded children who need to be protected.

In the end, Obama’s tactics didn’t work. In fact, he’s brought more attention to the matter than if he’d just not tampered with the recorded interpretation of Hollande’s remarks in the first place. The more he tip-toes around this issue, the more weight he actually gives to those words. Obama is setting a dangerous precedent of censorship and continuing a reckless pattern of underestimating the threat that Islamism poses. At least the French president seems to take things more seriously.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/04/04/4-things-to-know-about-obama-censoring-the-words-islamist-terrorism/,2016-04-04
A Misanthrope’s Guide To ‘Madam Secretary’,"I should fully disclose that I lost interest in popular culture several decades back. I don’t remember the exact year, but when people started producing songs without musical notes, featuring vulgar lyrics recited by misogynistic goons who bobbed up and down while struggling to keep their trousers from falling off, I headed for the exit and never looked back.

Traveling across the country in the nearly monastic solitude of an 18-wheeler for 11 years, I would quite literally go for months at a time without turning on the television. With books to keep me company, classical and jazz music in the background, absorbing the latest news during the day and writing in the evening, I was content. Although I stayed on the move while driving through 47 of the lower 48 states, paradoxically, I didn’t get out much. A walk through a mall was like a trip to the zoo, populated as it was by the kind of folks one simply doesn’t encounter in truck stops.

That all changed a little over a year ago, as I came off the cross-country circuit, married a remarkable lady, and, like the parched nomad who finds the mirage is real after all, basked in the exotic normalcy of a routine existence. This all makes me something of an alien to popular culture — although come to think of it, the term “alien” having become an insulting designation except when applied to law-abiding citizens, I accept it as badge of pride.

But my wife has come to the rescue. My conduit to hipdom, Shelley is sufficiently plugged in to the latest music, upcoming and current box office hits, and the latest television lineup that she has reintroduced me to contemporary entertainment trends. Then, as a wedding gift to each other, we purchased an immense, curved, 65-inch ultra-high-definition television with a picture so detailed that it shows the individual blades of artificial grass on a football field as well as the coach’s nose hair issues, all in vivid and sharp color.

A Fantasy Secretary of State

Sitting there, in rapturous and stupefied wonder as the most insignificant commercials burst larger than life from the screen, I was ripe for the picking when we began watching “Madam Secretary.” I vaguely remembered hearing about the show when it came out and assumed, given the old media’s habit of tossing editorial bouquets toward Democrats while hurling Molotov cocktails at Republicans, that it was the network’s extension of the Hillary 2016 campaign.

How many television programs have you seen, after all, in which the CIA is characterized as either effective or ethical?

Then there was the remark by Lori McCreary, the show’s executive producer, that the idea for the show first occurred while watching Hillary Clinton face the glare of legitimate questions over the deaths of four Americans and ask in exasperation, “What difference, at this point, does it make?” Wondering what it’s like to be a female secretary of State, McCreary had an idea for a television show and voila, here we are!

Then there was CBS’ own synopsis of the show, to wit: “Madam Secretary stars Téa Leoni as Elizabeth McCord, the shrewd, determined Secretary of State who drives international diplomacy, battles office politics and circumvents protocol as she negotiates global and domestic issues, both at the White House and at home. A college professor and a brilliant former CIA analyst who left for ethical reasons, Elizabeth returned to public life at the request of President Conrad Dalton following the suspicious death of her predecessor. The President values McCord’s apolitical leanings, her deep knowledge of the Middle East, her flair for languages and her ability to not just think outside the box, but to not even acknowledge there is a box. …”

So we have an academic who left the CIA “for ethical reasons.” Owing at least in part to a media bias that renders the words “CIA” and “unethical” a redundancy, I had a sense where all this was going. How many television programs have you seen, after all, in which the CIA is characterized as either effective or ethical?

Of course, I also thought to myself, CBS’ promotional narrative would naturally describe Elizabeth McCord as “apolitical.” Ever heard any references to “staunch liberals,” or the “hard left” on the evening news? Me neither.

Democrats Who Forcefully Pursue American Interests?

But something happened on the way to the showcase of ideological superficialities. Of course there are the obligatory genuflections toward liberal causes like global warming, with the accompanying two-dimensional depiction of Republicans as a cross between the GEICO caveman and Darth Vader. But that sort of thing comes around about as often as the M104 Bus between Broadway and 42nd Street in Manhattan (every 10 minutes) and is, therefore, about as interesting.

Within hours of the dirty bomb attack, our fictional administration uses military force overseas to fire the first salvo of America’s response.

What I found truly arresting about the show, however, is that they’ve managed to create fictional Democrats who are not only unapologetic about national security, but utterly fierce about the use of force to advance American interests. For instance, take the recent episode in which a dirty nuke was detonated in Washington DC. Upon learning that the culprit in the attack is a Saudi Arabian diplomat currently located at the Saudi embassy, President Dalton orders assault teams to converge on the embassy to retrieve said culprit by force.

It didn’t stop there. Madam Secretary herself calls in the Saudi ambassador, presents him with irrefutable evidence and demands that the Saudis immediately turn the SOB over. When the ambassador replies that he must consult with his government, McCord tells him American teams are even now at the Saudi embassy and will be entering the compound in five minutes. “That would be an act of war,” the ambassador blurts incredulously. “You’re right, it would be,” replies our heroine with a gaze that would freeze hell itself, before adding, “Now you have four minutes.”

Somewhat luckily, as the Americans prepare to assault the Saudi embassy, the camera pans up, up to the top of the building, where our culprit stands unsteadily, swaying before closing his eyes and falling to his death and the subsequent discovery that the whole 72 virgin bit was a cheap ruse. Then, within hours of the dirty bomb attack, our fictional administration uses military force overseas to fire the first salvo of America’s response.

Contrast the ‘Madam Secretary’ Fantasy with Reality

I previously described Madam Secretary’s administration as one made up of “fictional Democrats,” because the sort of Democrat who would unflinchingly order the seizure of a terrorist from a foreign embassy on American soil became extinct more than 50 years ago. Harry Truman deployed the Enola Gay to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and win the Second World War. Today, John Kerry deploys James Taylor to strum his little guitar and sing, “You’ve Got A Friend.”

Today, John Kerry deploys James Taylor to strum his little guitar and sing, ‘You’ve Got A Friend.’

More than 50 years ago, President Kennedy famously declared, “We shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.” Today, Barack Obama hobnobs with tyrants and homicidal monsters in Cuba while the Castro regime locks its critics in political prisons.

A fictional Dalton administration threatens war with Saudi Arabia over a single terrorist attack while the horribly real Obama administration gets rolled by a state sponsor of terrorism in Tehran. A fictional Secretary Elizabeth McCord stares down those who would threaten America while the real Secretary Hillary Clinton hands out reset buttons, refuses her ambassador’s desperate requests for needed security enhancements in Libya, and blamed a video for the terrorist attack which killed that ambassador and three other Americans.

This is where, unwittingly or not, the creators of “Madam Secretary” may have performed a valuable service for those voters who note the yawning discrepancies between fictional Democrats who prioritize the lives and interests of American citizens, and the nonfictional Democrats who turn a blind eye to deadly threats and play nice with barbarians, all while telling the American people to just lie back and think of diversity.

Silence Is Death: The Generational Case For Free Speech,"Editor’s note: This is the text of the Eugene C. Pulliam lecture Hemingway delivered at Hillsdale College on March 17, 2016.

I’m a political journalist, and one way of describing at what I do is that I spend my days arguing with people. When you put it that way, the job doesn’t sound particularly enjoyable or pleasant, and I confess that it’s often not. However, the debates roiling America at the moment — from the assaults on religious liberty to the size of America’s ever-growing administrative state — are increasingly vital. To quote Calvin Coolidge, it is important that we be “lovers of freedom and anxious for the fray.”

But as controversial and even nasty as our debates have become, the most dispiriting thing about the American politics is that I increasingly spend much of my time not debating the merits of particular candidates and policies, but having to reaffirm the necessity of having the debates in the first place.

As for needing a reminder about the threats to free speech, you do not need to take my word for it. Last year, playwright and Oscar-winning screenwriter Tom Stoppard observed the threats to free speech are perilous. “I think it’s quite a frightening time,” he said accepting a PEN/Allen Foundation Literary Service Award.

Stoppard fled Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia as a child and spent much of his career traveling and speaking out on behalf of artists and dissidents in the Soviet Union and communist Eastern Europe, so his concerns ought to carry considerable weight.

In particular, Stoppard was concerned about last year’s attack on the French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo, where Muslim terrorists stormed the newspaper’s offices and killed 12 people in response to the paper’s blasphemous cartoons.

Stoppard went on to say, “The Charlie Hebdo massacre was an appalling body shock to anybody who cares about life, let alone literature. You are left thinking, ‘Well, if it comes to making a choice here, clearly one has to choose that one should be allowed and entitled to offend without being murdered for it.’ That seems self-evident. That doesn’t mean that one is in harmony with the attitude or the particular instances of what is being said and written and drawn.”

Undoing the Cultural Consensus on Free Speech

Stoppard is right. But this point is self-evident only if you are familiar with the West’s heritage of classical liberalism, and there is currently a great effort underway to unmake this cultural consensus on free speech. Case in point: The PEN literary organization, which was honoring Stoppard for his “defense of creative freedom worldwide” last year, soon found itself embroiled in an open revolt with its own membership, who were upset that the organization also wanted to give a free speech award to Charlie Hebdo.

There’s nice literary irony to Trudeau accusing Charlie Hebdo of metaphorically ‘punching down’ when they were literally shot and killed in response.

Indeed, a number of other prominent voices used the attack on Charlie Hebdo as an opportunity not to speak out about violence or intolerance but, instead, to criticize Charlie Hebdo.

Barely a week before Stoppard made these remarks, Doonesbury cartoonist Gary Trudeau, was given a Career Achievement Award at the allegedly prestigious George Polk Journalism Awards. For you younger folks, Gary Trudeau rose to fame as a political cartoonist in the 1970s lampooning Richard Nixon at a time when every elite cultural institution in America was already assailing the corrupt president.

Naturally, Trudeau used the occasion of his career journalism award to chastise his murdered colleagues at Charlie Hebdo for drawing cartoons he called “hate speech.” He went on to say that by daring to satirize Muslims’ religious beliefs, Charlie Hebdo was “punching downward, by attacking a powerless, disenfranchised minority.” But when you have the means and will to carry out mass executions of people you don’t agree with, you’re anything but powerless. There’s nice literary irony to Trudeau accusing Charlie Hebdo of metaphorically “punching down” when they were literally shot and killed in response.

After I criticized Trudeau’s remarks in print, my editors at The Weekly Standard received a letter from no less than John Darnton, the curator of the George Polk journalism awards. The letter attacked me personally as a “bent-for-hell headline grabber” and said I was “grievously misrepresenting” Trudeau’s argument.

Darnton went on to explain that Trudeau wasn’t failing to defend free speech, but was merely accusing Charlie Hebdo of having “fed the flames of violence and caused Muslims throughout France to rally around the extremists.” I can only thank Darnton for writing this letter, which both clearly and obliviously reinforces everything I said in the first place. The notion that it is hateful to satirize people who hold undemocratic beliefs—up to and including the belief it’s justified to massacre the staff of a newspaper you think is guilty of blasphemy—just because the people those people are labeled “a powerless, disenfranchised minority” is dangerous nonsense.

Why We Need Blasphemy

Indeed, Charlie Hebdo routinely drew blasphemous and obscene cartoons making fun of Jesus and the pope. Yet, there was never a serious worry that bunch of Christians would storm their newsroom and shoot them all. The suggestion that “Muslims throughout France” should be expected to rally around extremists who want to kill anyone who draws a cartoon mocking their faith is patronizing at best, racist at worst.

‘If a large enough group of someones is willing to kill you for saying something, then it’s something that almost certainly needs to be said.’

It is nearly impossible to understate how ignorant and shortsighted the view that modern notions of racial and class privilege should outweigh the need to draw a bright line protecting freedom of expression, much less serve as an excuse for violence.

Perhaps in an ideal world we’d all refrain from going out of our way to offend, but as columnist Ross Douthat has argued, even the right to blaspheme is crucial to defend. According to Douthat, “If a large enough group of someones is willing to kill you for saying something, then it’s something that almost certainly needs to be said, because otherwise the violent have veto power over liberal civilization, and when that scenario obtains it isn’t really a liberal civilization any more.”

But among his peers, Douthat is a thinker of unusual clarity. I’m afraid that while journalists are fond of uttering self-soothing words about their commitment to free speech, the unwillingness to defend the values that enable their profession is becoming characteristic instead of exceptional.

Civilization’s Vanguard Hides Like Sissy Girls

My ongoing run-ins with the journalistic establishment over free speech are proof enough of that. After the Hebdo massacre, many news outlets noted that one of the much-beloved, now-murdered Charlie Hebdo cartoonists, Stéphane Charbonnier, was put on a hit list in the pages of the grimly named al-Qaeda magazine Inspire. Also listed at the bottom of the same page, under the headline “Wanted Dead or Alive for Crimes Against Islam” was Molly Norris. I don’t expect you to know who that is; only that the fact you don’t know the name Molly Norris represents a major collective failing.

On September 14, 2010, Seattle Weekly announced that its cartoonist Molly Norris had gone into hiding with the help of the FBI.

On September 14, 2010, Seattle Weekly announced that its cartoonist Molly Norris had gone into hiding with the help of the FBI. Earlier that year, Norris had gained some prominence as the founder of Everybody Draw Muhammad Day. Norris hoped this event would become a rallying cry to defend cartoonists. This prompted none other than prominent al-Qaeda and Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki to issue a fatwa calling for Norris’ murder.

At the time Norris went into hiding, I was working at the Washington Examiner, where we published an editorial condemning various media organizations for failing to speak out in her defense, including the Society for Professional Journalists and American Society of News Editors. In fact, I was the one tasked with writing the editorial as well as personally calling the Society for Professional Journalists and American Society of News Editors to find out what they had said in defense of Norris, which as it turns out, was nothing.

As I wrote at the time, “freedom of speech and press are in deep trouble when the American government thinks the best it can do to protect a journalist from death threats is to counsel her to go into hiding, and when the elite voices of American journalism can’t be bothered to say anything in her defense.”

The Society for Professional Journalists responded to this criticism by privately emailing reporters across the country and saying the Examiner editorial was “misleading and was most likely written to gain headlines.” Now, where have I heard that before? That particular attack on our journalistic integrity was even more laughable when the transcript of my phone call to the Society of Professional Journalists was eventually published in response.

How About Rebuffing Instead of Enabling the Aggressors

Yet the most damnable aspect of the whole episode isn’t just that most journalists chose to ignore what happened to Norris, it’s that they are instead willfully deluded about the true threats to free speech. Four days after Norris went into hiding, New York Times columnist Nick Kristof lamented the “venom on the airwaves, equating Muslims with terrorists … Muslims are one of the last minorities in the United States that it is still possible to demean openly, and I apologize for the slurs.” I’d suggest Kristof ask Norris if it’s possible to demean Muslims openly, but I’m pretty sure she’s unavailable for comment.

I’d suggest Kristof ask Norris if it’s possible to demean Muslims openly, but I’m pretty sure she’s unavailable for comment.

Even before the Charlie Hebdo massacre, Kristof’s Muslim apologia was pretty rich coming in the pages of a newspaper that had refused to print the controversial Danish Mohammed cartoons when they were the biggest news story on the planet in 2006.

The New York Times justification for this at the time was that “This seems a reasonable choice for news organizations that usually refrain from gratuitous assaults on religious symbols.” After the Hebdo massacre last year, the Times once again doubled down on the pretense it refrains from “gratuitous assaults” on religious believers.

“Under Times standards, we do not normally publish images or other material deliberately intended to offend religious sensibilities,” said the paper in a statement it gave to Buzzfeed. “After careful consideration, Times editors decided that describing the [Charlie Hebdo] cartoons in question would give readers sufficient information to understand today’s story.”

The Times regularly publishes stuff offensive to believers, provided they’re confident those believers won’t shoot up their newsroom.

Not five months after their statement on why they would not publish the Charlie Hebdo cartoons, the Times ran a story on Chris Ofili’s painting, “The Holy Virgin Mary.” According to the Times, the painting “caused a furor when it was shown at the Brooklyn Museum in October 1999… The eight-foot-high depiction of a black Virgin Mary, encrusted with a lump of elephant dung and collaged bottoms from pornographic magazines, outraged religious leaders.”

The story was illustrated with, yes, a picture of the offensive painting. Again we see the Times regularly publishes stuff offensive to believers, provided they’re confident those believers won’t shoot up their newsroom.

At Least Don’t Lie About Being Afraid

Saying the New York Times should be brave enough to publish things that may invite violence upon itself is a lot to ask for. What’s not a lot to ask for is for the paper to dispense with their transparently disingenuous rationalizations about why they don’t do this.

‘If you are frightened, at least have the guts to say that. The most effective form of censorship is one that nobody admits exists.’

After the Charlie Hebdo attack, the Jyllands-Posten, the Danish newspaper that originally published the controversial Mohammed cartoons that sparked violence and worldwide protests a decade ago, refused to publish any of Hebdo’s controversial cartoons. The Jyllands-Posten editor, Flemming Rose, subsequently wrote a book, “The Tyranny of Silence,” about the paper’s ordeal. It is an admirable cri de coeur about the need for free speech. But when Rose was asked about the refusal to publish the Hebdo cartoons he told the BBC, “We caved in. Violence works… Sometimes the sword is mightier than the pen.”

At first blanch, Rose’s explicit cowardice may be hard to digest; but compared to the New York Times— it’s positively heroic. In response to Rose’s comments, British columnist Nick Cohen observed, “If you are frightened, at least have the guts to say that. The most effective form of censorship is one that nobody admits exists.”

It is both sad and undeniable that much of the Western media, along with most other guardians of the public trust, are eager to self-censor and are in complete denial about it. The only question before us now is what to do about it.

The Blame for Higher Education

We certainly didn’t arrive overnight at this place where our great institutions were unwilling to uphold the First Amendment. This cowardice and hostility to free speech is the result of being learned, taught, and absorbed over generations. You can all congratulate yourselves for choosing to attend Hillsdale. But the reality is that higher education might bear more responsibility for this tragic state of affairs than any other institution.

This cowardice and hostility to free speech is the result of being learned, taught, and absorbed over generations.

To give you just one example of and how thoroughly baked into the American cake a wrongly critical view of the First Amendment has become, when issues of controversial speech arise in the news, almost inevitably you will hear some educated person quote Oliver Wendell Holmes’s admonition that you can’t falsely shout fire in a crowded theater.

No one bothers to mention that Holmes’s quote comes from a ruling where the Supreme Court decided that merely distributing flyers in opposition to the draft in World War I violated the 1917 Espionage Act. Indeed, a great many Americans did hard time because good Wilsonian progressives decided opposing the government in public was a crime. In case you’re wondering, this is the same 1917 Espionage Act President Obama invoked in 2015 to justify the Department of Justice snooping on the Associated Press newsroom and Fox News national security reporter James Rosen.

I don’t think it’s an accident that Woodrow Wilson, the man largely responsible for probably the greatest abridgment of free speech in American history, the legacy of which still haunts us, was otherwise notable for being the president of Princeton University. Further, Wilson’s pioneering academic work in Hegelian progressivism, which represents a complete denial of obvious truths about human nature, is still the dominant intellectual force governing the academy and many other American institutions.

Free Speech No Longer Means Free Speech

How’s the progressive legacy working out for higher education? Most of you are familiar with the goat rodeo at the University of Missouri last year, where a professor physically threatened a student journalist and the inmates running Mizzou’s asylum managed to get the university president fired.

‘We can only exercise our right to free speech insofar as we feel safe and respected in doing so.’

But it’s worth looking at few more of the many recent examples of higher education gone wrong. Imagine you went back to a more innocent time—say, 10 years ago, when campuses were only largely, rather than completely, insane—and posited any number of recent developments as satire. People would regard these tales as unbelievable and incredibly overwrought.

Two years ago, the University of California Berkeley was celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Berkeley free speech movement, often credited with kicking off the modern era of campus activism. Romanticizing the Berkeley free speech movement too much is a mistake, but by the standards of contemporary campus activism even the use of the term “free speech” is laudable. However, I have my doubts that twenty-first-century Berkeley agrees.

To mark the anniversary, U.C. Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks sent out a memo that read, “As we honor this turning point in our history, it is important that we recognize the broader social context required in order for free speech to thrive.” You can probably tell where this is heading. Dirks went on to say, “Specifically, we can only exercise our right to free speech insofar as we feel safe and respected in doing so.”

You Can’t Talk Because I Don’t Like It

It is emphatically not true that the right to free speech depends on whether you are in a “safe space,” a concept college kids like to talk about but doesn’t really exist. Rather, the entire notion of America stands or falls on the assertion that our absolute right to free speech predates and stands apart from any authority that threatens it.

America stands or falls on the assertion that our absolute right to free speech predates and stands apart from any authority that threatens it.

History is full of heroes and martyrs who can testify to that. Were he alive, Patrick Henry would no doubt inform Chancellor Dirks that “Give me liberty insofar as we feel safe and respected asking for it!” doesn’t quite have the same ring to it.

Last year, Yale faculty member Erika Christakis sent an email in response to Yale University’s Intercultural Affairs Committee’s plea that students avoid wearing offensive Halloween costumes. Students reacted so poorly to her email that a few weeks later she announced she would suspend teaching courses at Yale.

Christakis asked what she mistakenly thought was a rhetorical question: “Have we lost faith in young people’s capacity—in your capacity—to exercise self-censure, through social norming, and also in your capacity to ignore or reject things that trouble you?”

Also last year, contrarian students at Amherst University posted flyers objecting to the message of campus protests sweeping the nation. These said “in memoriam… free speech.” A left-wing student group fired off an angry letter to the administration in response to the students concerned about preserving free speech.

Probably Universities Are a Lost Cause

Among their angry demands were that the students who posted the flyers expressing concern about free speech “go through the Disciplinary Process if a formal complaint is filed, and that they will be required to attend extensive training for racial and cultural competency.”

‘Extensive training for racial and cultural competency’ is rapidly becoming the singular, if disturbing, definition of education these days.

Indeed, “extensive training for racial and cultural competency” is rapidly becoming the singular, if disturbing, definition of education these days. In any event, Woodrow Wilson would be proud that his enduring academic influence means that people still regard posting flyers as a crime.

Speaking of Woodrow Wilson, students at Princeton University caught up in the recent spate of campus protests have been demanding that Wilson’s name be removed from campus. This is in response to Wilson’s unvarnished racism and in spite of the fact he’s the school’s most famous alumnus… Okay, fine. I have to confess I find this incident far more amusing than troubling.

However, such absurdities suggest the campus intellectual environment is possibly beyond redemption. It would be a fool’s errand to beg professors and administrators to stop propagating the corrosive ideas they’ve been spewing for decades. I think the solution to preserving free speech requires taking different tack.

What Death Can Teach Us about Free Speech

So I propose appealing to America’s students directly, and asking them to do the one thing that young adults never do, and that is this: Please consider your own mortality.

It feels great to be young, and I hope the students here today are self-aware enough to enjoy it. But I know one fact about everyone in this room for certain, and it is that some day we’re all going to die. I don’t point out our finite existence out to be depressing. As a Christian, I would tell you death is not the end. But also I tell you this simply because it’s the truth.

The ultimate point of upholding the right to free speech is that encouraging the robust competition of ideas is the best way that we know of to reaffirm and accumulate truth. That accumulation of truth happens over time. And over time, we all die.

Interestingly enough, it is John Stuart Mill, whose ideas about utilitarianism have done much to undermine natural rights, who has most eloquently articulated the generational case for free speech:

[The] peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.

Now if silencing expression results in robbing future generations of the truth, then what does this say about current student attitudes? The evidence so far is pretty disheartening. As the Wall Street Journal recently reported:

The William F. Buckley Jr. Program at Yale recently commissioned a survey from McLaughlin & Associates about attitudes towards free speech on campus. Some 800 students at a variety of colleges across the country were surveyed.



The results, though not surprising, are nevertheless alarming. By a margin of 51 percent to 36 percent, students favor their school having speech codes to regulate speech for students and faculty.



Sixty-three percent favor requiring professors to employ ‘trigger warnings’ to alert students to material that might be discomfiting.



One-third of the students polled could not identify the First Amendment as the part of the Constitution that dealt with free speech.



Thirty-five percent said that the First Amendment does not protect ‘hate speech,’ while 30 percent of self-identified liberal students say the First Amendment is outdated.

This suggests that today’s students are retreating from the realm of debate, leaving public opinion to be dominated by the tyranny of deranged minority viewpoints. Further, if we think about free speech in terms of posterity, these trends suggest that it will be as if a huge swath of the up and coming generation never existed. If there’s a blank page in the annals of history where your name and achievements in service of others could have been written, what’s the point?

So ask yourself, what’s the worst that could happen if you speak out? Well, yes, you could die. But once you come to terms with the fact that’s going to happen anyway, it’s tremendously clarifying.

Spend Your Life Exchanging Error for Truth

Tajar Djaout, an Algerian poet and novelist, put it this way: “Silence is death. If you speak, you die. If you are silent, you die. So speak, and die.” Djaout did not say this lightly; he was killed in 1993 by Muslim extremists.

If the last century is anything to go by, millions of lives will depend on the ability to speak the truth when others are incapable.

I don’t expect all of you be that heroic, and for those of you who aspire to be, I would caution you not to succumb to the fallacy that the worth of speech is judged by the size of the reaction it engenders.

But this is precisely why your education is so important and you should take it seriously. Adulthood is consumed by difficult judgments and the struggle to balance competing interests. College students are largely free of these responsibilities, because society has decided that now is the time in your development when you should learn to discern and express which ideas are the most true.

It is even hoped that you will learn to do this by also using the words that are the most appropriate and beautiful. Eventually, the best among you will serve as leaders and inspiring figures for the rest of us when challenges inevitably arise. If the last century is anything to go by, millions of lives will depend on the ability to speak the truth when others are incapable. But even a quiet life spent diligently exchanging error for truth goes a long way toward preserving freedom for future generations, and that is no small accomplishment.

So I reiterate that you are incredibly fortunate to attend a university that, from what I have witnessed, stands firmly in opposition to all of the forces conspiring to destroy our heritage of freedom. I hope all of you blessed to attend and contribute to this unique school can both serve as an example and reach out to the many other young Americans who not only aren’t being told the truth, but are being threatened the moment they stumble across it.

I hope you spend your time at Hillsdale honing your God-given abilities so that you are up to the enormity of the task being thrust upon future generations. But most of all, I hope that when you leave this room tonight, and when eventually you leave this campus for the wider world, you do so with a renewed sense of purpose regarding the two things that all us were born to do: Speak and die.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/04/28/silence-is-death-the-generational-case-for-free-speech/,2016-04-28
A Child’s Search For Father Transcends ‘Jungle Book’s’ Racism,"This spring brought Rudyard Kipling back into the news—or, at least, into a brief moment of notice by the chattering classes—as Disney attempted to revive its “Jungle Book” franchise by releasing a half live-action, half CGI film of Kipling’s stories about a boy named Mowgli, growing up in the jungles of India. The commentary was pretty much what you would expect.

Back in the first half of the twentieth century, the intelligentsia elected Kipling to stand as official apologist for the British imperialism it despised. Mid-century saw a number of highbrow efforts not exactly to defend Kipling but at least to point out that his work was far more sophisticated and literary than allowed by the smug attack of the right-thinking: T.S. Eliot, George Orwell, Lionel Trilling, and Randall Jarrell, for example, wrote essays on the topic.

But it was all to little or no avail. The extraordinary mixture of poetry and fiction in his books, the fact that he was (and remains) the youngest winner of the Nobel Prize for literature, the endless quotability of his verse, the strangely perfect construction of his short stories (especially after the death of his son in the First World War): None of it could stand beside his Big Englandism and support for the Empire.

Trot Out the Accusations of Racism

European empires being thin on the ground these days, the twenty-first-century version has Kipling as a prejudiced despiser of all who are not British. Or, as an iO9 headline put it last month: “Reminder: Rudyard Kipling Was a Racist F—ck and The Jungle Book Is Imperialist Garbage.” Or, as Slate chimed in, it’s fine to like Disney’s new ​“Jungle Book” movie, but only because it “Subverts the Gross Colonialism of Rudyard Kipling.”

The i09 attack ends up suggesting little more than that all the past was bad in a racist way, and thus Kipling, as representative of his age, was bad.

Kipling has no chance to escape being labeled politically incorrect these days, nor does he deserve to, in some ways. The i09 attack ends up suggesting little more than that all the past was bad in a racist way, and thus Kipling, as representative of his age, was bad—which is about as unsophisticated as a literary attack can get. Kipling was far more intelligent about it all, but that has the unfortunate consequence that, when he put thoughts that modern taste finds unpalatable, he directed his genuine intelligence toward those thoughts and made them even worse.

Still, the current set of easy attacks on the man miss the center of his “Jungle Book” stories. You think his supposed racism is bad? His supposed imperialism a disgrace? The most politically incorrect things about Kipling’s stories for children actually derive from his intense feeling of being an abandoned child, sent home from India to live in a boarding school at age five. The subtext of nearly every one of his children’s stories is a boy’s desperate need for a father—and the fantasy in all those Kipling stories is an abandoned child’s hunger for multiple fathers, each fulfilling one of the archetypal roles of a father.

A Boy Hungers for His Father

In his boy spy and adventure novel “Kim,” for example, the hero is an orphan castaway—a trickster, hustler child lost on the teeming streets of Lahore. Little Friend of All the World, he’s called sometimes, but he knows he is lost. “Who is Kim – Kim – Kim?” he chants himself into self-hypnosis. “Who is Kim? What is Kim?”

This is an author so eager for a father that he cannot write about a boy without casting every older male in a father role.

What he finds through the story is a set of fathers to help him be many things. Mahbub Ali, a Pashtun horse trader, becomes the mature figure of worldliness for the boy. An elderly Tibetan Lama becomes the father of his spiritual unworldliness. Lurgan Sahib, guiding him through the memory techniques of Kim’s Game, takes the role of father as teacher, and a British officer, in the Great Game of espionage, becomes the father figure who calls the boy to a high political purpose.

If “Kim” can be read as a book about a boy’s hunger for fathers, Kipling’s wish-fulfillment in “Jungle Book” is even more consuming. The figure of Kaa, the giant python, is given a sultry voice by Scarlett Johansson in the new Disneyfied movie version, and Slate’s Katy Waldman sneers at Kipling for having envisioned the character as a male. But, except for Raksha, Mowgli’s Mother Wolf, all the figures who look after Mowgli are males—because they have to be.

This is an author so eager for a father that he cannot write about a boy without casting every older male in a father role. The bear, Baloo, is father as kindly but learned teacher. The panther, Bagheera, is father as attractively dangerous and mercurial. Wolf pack leader Akela is father as clan lawgiver. Kaa is father as source of ancient memory and possessor of mysterious powers. Even Mowgli’s enemy, Shere Khan the tiger, is father as threat to the young.

Losing the Lost Boy

You’d think that all this would be gobbled up these days, in an era in which filmmakers are so desperate to find mythopoeic material that they have raided nearly every comic book ever published. But Disney went off the tracks all the way back in 1967, when it produced its first cartoon version of the Mowgli tales that Kipling had scattered through the two short-story volumes he called “The Jungle Books.”

Along the way, they lost the plot, and although the boy accepts fathering, he no longer needs it, deep in his psyche.

As the film was being developed, the dying Walt Disney—or, more probably, his corporate staff, determined to preserve the Disney image—fired the screenplay’s writer and composer for keeping too close to the dark and dangerous elements of the original stories. The new staff made it instead a musical comedy (and introduced a new racism into the Bander-log monkeys). Along the way, they lost the plot, as the expression goes, and although the boy accepts fathering, he no longer needs it, deep in his psyche.

Jon Favreau, director of the new live-action/CGI version for Disney, faced what was probably an insoluble problem with “The Jungle Book.” He couldn’t make it deeper, couldn’t return to the mythopoeic original, without betraying the brand. But he couldn’t just let it rest with the light comedy of the cartoon. Casting Bill Murray as the voice of Baloo meant the bear would return to his teacher role, so he was left with Ben Kingsley, as the voice of Bagheera, to act as the father.

It’s an inconsistent bit of writing, since one character cannot fulfill all those roles, but, worse, it comes in a modern script that actually doesn’t much believe in fathers. Or, at least, doesn’t believe boys much need fathers to act as mentors, guardians, teachers, spiritual guides, deposits of cultural memory, and lawgivers.

Yes, Kipling deserves many of the politically correct epithets tossed his way on the occasion of a new “Jungle Book” movie. But he deserves another for a view no one seems to be mentioning: Boys need fathers—deep, deep in their souls.

Facebook's Trending Topics Executive Is A Big Hillary Donor,"The Facebook executive who oversees the Trending Topics product for the social media giant is a big Hillary Clinton donor, public records show. Facebook is currently under fire for deliberately blacklisting and censoring conservative outlets and news topics. According to a former “news curator” tasked with managing the Trending Topics feed, Facebook’s deliberate blacklisting of legitimately trending topics “had a chilling effect on conservative news.”

Facebook claims it has “rigorous guidelines” to prevent political bias from corrupting its news aggregation service, but Tom Stocky, the Facebook executive in charge of the Trending Topics product, has a long history of progressive political activism. In October of 2015, for example, Stocky and his wife, a Google executive, donated $5,400 to the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics:

In 2012, Stocky approvingly posted print and video excerpts of President Barack Obama’s anti-gun speech following the Newtown shootings. Stocky liked a video posted on Facebook by Vox of Obama condemning people who wished to tighten U.S. border security in the wake of the terrorist attacks in France in which several terrorists posed as refugees to gain access to the country.

In one Facebook post following the Paris attacks, Stocky declared that the purpose of the attacks was not to murder large numbers of people, but to get people to react to them.

“Their goal with these terrorist acts is to incite a strong reaction, specifically a strong reaction that includes persecuting Muslims,” Stocky wrote.

He later declared in the same post, without providing any evidence, that the terrorists aren’t Muslim at all.

“These terrorists today are invoking Islam while killing people,” Stocky said. “None of them are actually Muslim.”

Contrary to Stocky’s assertion, recent polls show that tens of millions of Muslims worldwide believe that violent attacks such as suicide bombings can be justified:

In 2013, Stocky posted a comment on his Facebook page praising Wikipedia for breathlessly following the gay marriage debate.

“It’s pretty awesome to watch Wikipedia update in real time,” Stocky wrote, “especially when each update improves the flatly-worded description of history-making, about-damn-time equality.”

On June 26, 2015, the day the Supreme Court released its Obergefell decision declaring that the Constitution requires gay marriage to be legal, Stocky posted an article from the New York Times about the progression of gay marriage laws in the U.S. with the statement, “The map starts improving in 2004 and then finally hits full awesome in 2015, today. ‪#‎MarriageEquality‬” Stocky also regularly changed his Facebook profile photo to express solidarity various various LGBT causes.

One of the photos features Stocky wearing a “Love Conquers Hate” gay rights shirt which implies that defending natural marriage is tantamount to hate.

Stocky also found himself in the news in 2013 after he published an article about his courageous choice to take four months of paternity leave after his daughter was born. Stocky later complained to the New York Times that it was unfair of people to take notice of his lengthy paternity leave but not his wife’s maternity leave.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/05/10/facebooks-trending-topics-executive-is-a-big-hillary-clinton-donor/,2016-05-10
The Fight Against Islamism Is The New Cold War,"Even today, with the West and Russia edging closer to outright conflict, there’s a simple nostalgia for the Cold War era, when conflict was easier to visualize and manage than it is now. Instead of today’s hellbroth of terror groups, failed states, and warring militias, we faced a single, unified foe, an iron curtain drawn across the middle of the world to cleanly demarcate where we ended and they began.

2016 is the year—as the truth comes out about how last year’s Paris attacks could have happened—that this strangely comforting Cold War myth should die. As the latest revelations about those attacks confirm, today’s world bears much more of a resemblance to the world of the Cold War than we might wish to think—and, somehow, the West must respond accordingly.

History confirms the comparison. Think back. The geopolitically bipolar structure of the Cold War world was just one feature of the threat matrix the West faced. As conventional armies and nuclear arsenals squared off against one another, seeds of the unconventional warfare that bedevils us today had already begun to sprout. Beyond the third-world proxy conflicts and arms shipments that defined the age, the Cold War saw the beginnings of state-sponsored terrorism and infiltration as we know them today.

This Time, It’s Not Different

Many may want to cling to the “clean” Cold War myth for its own sake. But the myth also shores up the entrancing idea that the matrix of conflict jihadist Islam and its allies pose today does not rise to threat level when militant communism straddled the globe.

Circumstantial evidence has suggested to our impressionable minds that it’s different this time. After all, “nobody” really thinks absolutist Islam is a genuine intellectual and emotional competitor to Western life. To be sure, some of the West’s losers and rejects have found themselves in the arms of the Islamic State, or loosely associated with foes who appreciate, if not aid and abet, jihadist gains against the United States and Europe.

But at the height of the Cold War, a host of respectable Westerners believed communism might actually be right and capitalism wrong—whether at the level of ideology or sheer practicality. Because absolutist Islam is so alien and particular, relative to the grand yet familiar abstractions Marx ushered in, we’re apt to think the jihadists and their allies may be able to attack our people and our systems, but they cannot really defeat our civilization.

It’s easy to think this way because we’re so resistant to the prospect of another existential threat to our civilization. It doesn’t just strike people as reasonable that terror attacks won’t rise to the level of catastrophe promised by a strategic nuclear exchange. It strikes them as emotionally correct or necessary—not just because it’s easier to live in a world where a few major cities might be destroyed and not all human life on earth, but because so few people really believe we could actually win a world war against the jihadists and their allies.

If the Soviet Union seemed prohibitively difficult to defeat, at least there was a plan and enough willingness in the West to execute it. Today, it’s psychologically unacceptable for many people to imagine that we’re at acute risk of civilizational defeat yet lack a viable, acceptable blueprint to avoid that fate.

Subterfuge May Be More Effective Than Instant Destruction

Well, it’s time for a wake-up call—even though the head check we need raises the risk that fear and recklessness will increase as a result. As the emerging truth about the Paris attacks shows, the parallels are clear between the “dirty” truth about the Cold War and the dark reality of the state of play in our conflict with international jihadists and their allies. The nexus of state-sponsored terror, subversion, and infiltration established during the Cold War has been reactivated, threatening not just Western people or Western systems but Western civilization itself. We can argue over whether this threat is “existential” or not. Most significant is that it really is a civilization being targeted, on top of people and systems.

Let’s be clear about what this means. In theory, terror, subversion, and infiltration could destroy Western civilization by carrying off a kind of coup on the communist model: you wake up one day and a revolutionary vanguard has seized state power and the means of production. However nightmarish, that’s not the kind of attack on Western civilization we should focus on.

More plausible, more efficient, and more effective is an attack with more limited and devious aims. Much as a Russian spy might opt against killing a victim outright, choosing instead to administer a debilitating but nonlethal dose of poison, jihadists and their allies are now well-positioned to cripple Western civilization, inflicting harm without provoking a true world war the West would eventually win.

This is the lesson we are only now able to learn from Paris. France, in a jihadist proof of concept, is now on the verge of becoming a garrison state. Officials have been reduced to monitoring airport and public transit workers for signs of jihadist activity—or mere sympathy. The French head of intelligence, Patrick Calvar, admitted to Parliament that he expected “a new form of attack” from the Islamic State, “characterized by placing explosive devices in places where there are large crowds and repeating this type of action to create a climate of maximum panic.”

What is new here is not terrorism’s fear factor. Rather, it is the active and passive paralysis that comes from a judgment that one’s society is so badly compromised from the inside that one’s civilization—one’s rights, freedoms, pleasures, celebrations, and moral values—is now inoperable.

The Paris Attacks Were More Sophisticated Than We’d Thought

Thanks to Paris, just that kind of judgment is in danger of being formed. That attack, like any attacks to follow, was about far more than the Islamic State. Rather than a ragtag band of psychotic losers engaged in random bloodshed, a growing body of evidence now suggests that the Paris attacks were driven by a Cold War-style project that united subversion, infiltration, and terror into a single plan of attack.

Doubtless, ragtag losers linked to ISIS served as the tip of the spear. But the profile of the attack’s logistician, 26-year-old Salah Abdeslam, runs curiously counter to that of a true mastermind or true jihadist, who’d have shown more brains and more of a willingness to martyr himself—especially given, as Abdeslam was, more than one perfect opportunity.

Yet the Paris attackers carried out a plan crafted at a level of sophistication that raises serious and immediate questions, complete with strict communications security and explosives too dangerous and delicate to be wired by amateurs. In a pattern last exposed so dramatically during Algeria’s struggle with Islamism in the ‘90s, the Paris attack shows hallmarks of involvement by a foreign intelligence agency.

“Who might have stood behind the Paris attacks has been the subject of extensive speculation in Western intelligence circles since last November,” one former National Security Ageny counterintelligence expert recently noted. “We need answers to these complex and messy questions, but nobody publicly wants to ask them.”

The Paris attack shows hallmarks of involvement by a foreign intelligence agency.

Nobody, perhaps, but those with the most to say and the least to lose. In an interview with Gavin McInnes published at old-school paleocon Taki Theodoracopoulos’s eponymous online magazine, Eagles of Death Metal frontman Jesse Hughes made a series of superficially astonishing claims about what really happened when his Bataclan concert was turned into a slaughter.

“There’s no denying the terrorists were already inside, and they had to get in somehow,” he said. “During the shooting I went outside and the backstage door was propped open. How did that happen?” “There were two girls who were involved,” Hughes added. “They were at the venue and vanished before the shooting, and these women were in traditional Muslim garb.”

Jihadis May Not Be Working Alone

In a quip assured to trigger some skepticism, Hughes claimed he saw “Muslims celebrating in the street during the attack. I saw it with my own eyes. In real time! How did they know what was going on? There must have been coordination.” Shortly after the Paris attack, however, I was quietly told the same by a well-connected North African: an operation like that, the individual explained, simply could not be conducted without sympathizers and accomplices on the inside.

An operation like that simply could not be conducted without sympathizers and accomplices on the inside.

Although there is no smoking gun linking a foreign government or organization to the Paris attacks, there is a prima facie case that some were involved, most likely utilizing the triad of subversion, infiltration, and terrorism that gave the Cold War its truly dirty and messy character. What’s more, it’s easy to hazard an educated guess about who the attacks’ putative foreign operators might be. You’d be hard-pressed, for instance, to find an outside organization with the requisite motives and capabilities if you ruled out Hezbollah. From there, it’s not unreasonable to imagine connecting a line of complicity to individuals within one of Hezbollah’s favorite foreign governments.

There is no question that this kind of theorizing can get out of hand—not just due to human beings’ love for a gripping story, but because (let’s face it) most people are required to make sense of today’s world without ever getting to learn the most crucial information. Still, what we can glimpse of that information is pointing good analysts toward a view of today’s deepening world conflict that’s starkly reminiscent of the Cold War at its most shadowy and lethal. “Existential” or no, the threat posed to Western civilization is real, and the time to adopt a workable plan to confront that threat is growing short.

Did Hillary Just Figure Out How To Attack Trump?,"Hillary Clinton’s anti-Trump foreign policy speech the other day was one of the best I’ve seen her give in a long time. The transcript of the speech is here. The speech is largely criticizing Trump from what could be described as the internationalist center of American foreign policy – a center that prizes international stability and order. Where it hits hardest is in the portions where Clinton promises herself as a force for peace and Trump as a force for chaos.

What is most notable is how freed Clinton is from the burden faced by Republicans in the 2016 primary: they had to respect, or pretend to respect, Trump’s voters as a part of their winning coalition, and were thus forced to attack Trump while noting their sympathy for the grievances of his backers. Clinton has no such challenge: she can attack Trump as an idiot while also implying that those who agree with him are idiots without any obvious negative political ramifications. So she does.

What was particularly remarkable was the portion of the speech where Clinton attacked Trump from the right on the issue of American exceptionalism – and Trump’s apparent belief that America has not been great for a very long time: “Trump says over and over again, “The world is laughing at us.” He’s been saying this for decades, he didn’t just start this year. He bought full-page ads in newspapers across the country back in 1987, when Ronald Reagan was President, saying that America lacked a backbone and the world was – you guessed it – laughing at us. He was wrong then, and he’s wrong now – and you’ve got to wonder why somebody who fundamentally has so little confidence in America, and has felt that way for at least 30 years, wants to be our President.”

Eli Lake compares this to the 1984 remarks of Jeane Kirkpatrick.

Clinton has done to Donald Trump what Kirkpatrick did to Clinton’s party back in 1984. Clinton questioned the presumptive Republican presidential nominee’s love of country and asked why he was so nice to the dictators who hate it. It was a theme of Clinton’s major address in San Diego. ‘If Donald gets his way, they will be celebrating in the Kremlin;’ ‘I don’t understand Donald’s bizarre fascination with dictators who don’t like America;’ ‘I will leave it to the psychologists to explain his affection for tyrants,’ and so on. In most election years it is the Republicans who do this kind of thing.

Now Clinton can deploy it, and she may be able to do so effectively. It would make sense, logically… though as John Podhoretz notes, change a few lines here and there, and this could be a Marco Rubio speech. And we saw how that worked out.

“We all know the tools Donald Trump brings to the table – bragging, mocking, composing nasty tweets – I’m willing to bet he’s writing a few right now.” It is a win-win of a line, as Mollie Hemingway notes. “It’s a good line! If he doesn’t tweet anything at her, it will seem like she’s scared him into silence. If he does, she’s already pre-rebutted it.” However: “But one problem with both the media coverage of 2016’s campaign and Clinton’s response to Trump is that both seem to think that repeatedly pointing out that Trump is non-conventional and Clinton is the embodiment of conventional will help Clinton. Is there sufficient reason to think that’s the case? Or, in fact, is Trump’s complete renunciation of all political wisdom the key to his success?”

Ian Bremmer is far more skeptical about the speech, arguing that it is targeted at the political and media establishment, not the American people. I’m not so sure. The poll data cited below in response to suggestions about the rise of American populism on foreign policy issues suggests, just as those I cited yesterday about the party coalescing, that this year is more conventional than our conversations would indicate in the makeup of what American voters want from their respective parties.

It’s possible that what Clinton is really doing here is trying to stem off the one thing that could significantly elevate Trump’s chances in November: an incident of chaos. She thinks it is apparently very important to assert that when a crisis happens, she deserves the phone call, not Trump. It seems obvious how Trump will respond to that.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/06/03/did-hillary-just-figure-out-how-to-attack-trump/,2016-06-03
What We Know About The Orlando Terrorist Who Killed 50,"Authorities say Omar Mateen, 29, of Fort Pierce, Fla., killed 50 people and injured 53 others early Sunday morning. ISIS has claimed responsibility for his actions, making it the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, and the worst terror attack on U.S. soil since 9/11.

Twenty minutes into the attack, Omar Mateen dialed 9-1-1 and pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, and mentioned the Boston bomber. After a three-hour confrontation with local police forces, during which he held a group of people hostage, he was shot dead by a SWAT team.

ISIS has since claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the Amaq News Agency, ISIS’s official news arm.

“The armed attack that targeted a gay night club in the city of Orlando in the American state of Florida which left over 100 people dead or injured was carried out by an Islamic State fighter,” Amaq News Agency said.

39. Here is a screen grab of the Amaq announcement. Notice the wording regarding information from a source: pic.twitter.com/uBTNfbeelY — Rukmini Callimachi (@rcallimachi) June 12, 2016

Omar Mateen was born in New York and is of Afghani descent. His ex-wife said he was unstable and was abusive towards her during the few months they were married.

“He was not a stable person,” she told The Washington Post under the condition of anonymity. “He beat me. He would just come home and start beating me up because the laundry wasn’t finished or something like that.”

Omar Mateen’s father, Seddique Mateen, claimed that his son’s actions had “nothing to do with religion,” and said his son was angered several months ago after he saw two men kissing.

Seddique Mateen, who hosted a talk show on an Afghani news channel that broadcasts from California, has publicly spoken in support of the Afghan Taliban and denounced the Pakistani government. Episodes of the show have been uploaded to a YouTube channel under Seddique Mateen’s name. Contact information featured on the show was traced to the Mateens’ Florida residence, The Washington Post reported.

Another friend described Omar Mateen to WaPo as being “very religious,” and said he went on a pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, which is considered to an important part of the Muslim faith.

The FBI had investigated Omar Mateen twice, once in 2013 and again in 2014, as a person of interest whom they suspected had connections to a known terrorist, The Daily Beast reported. The FBI subsequently dropped its investigations into Mateen when the probes resulted in nothing to warrant further examination.

In a news conference Sunday, President Obama called the Orlando shooting an act of terror and hate.

“Although it’s still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate,” Obama said. “As Americans, we are united in grief, in outrage, and in resolve to defend our people.”

Mateen used a rifle and a handgun, which authorities say he purchased legally in the days leading up to the attack.

The United States has failed to come up with a response that actually targets the cause of terrorist attacks perpetuated by radicalized lone wolves, said Federalist publisher Ben Domenech on CBS’s “Face The Nation” today.

“Evil men will always exist, they will do evil things,” Domenech said. “The victory over evil is not something that’s within our capacity to grasp and so it’s the fight that counts, and I think in this context that fight is an ideological fight more than it is over ‘policy X’ or ‘policy Y’ that wouldn’t have removed small arms from this man’s hands and spared these lives.”

“You have these over and over again,” Domenech said. “These small arms massacres and then a policy response that I think the people feel is either insufficient or actually actually targets the victims — taking guns out of their hands, or engaging in policies that are not actually going to prevent these sorts of things in the future.”

“I’m not sure that we’ve figured out a response to this and I think that helps these active folks in the Middle East who encourage these types of terrorist attacks,” he said.

Our Leaders Must Look At Islamism Without Flinching,"While we’re still reeling from the terrorist attack in Orlando on Sunday, Europe is bracing itself for a similar attack because of a confluence of events and timing. This most recent attack in America and the heightened threat in Europe reminds us that our leaders are not doing their jobs. They’re not looking at this threat head on.

Friday marked the beginning of the 2016 UEFA European soccer championship that runs until July 10. France is hosting the international tournament in stadiums throughout the country, including the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, one of the targets of the November 13 Paris attacks. An event this large, attracting so many from abroad, makes it an obvious target for a terrorist attack. France has even launched a smartphone app that alerts you if an attack is occurring near you.

One reason for heightened fear is that Germany recently arrested three men who were plotting an attack on a pedestrian shopping area in Düsseldorf. Their goal was to “kill as many passersby as possible.” The authorities in Germany were tipped off by a man named Saleh A., who turned himself in to French authorities in February. The man helped police find the three co-conspirators, but told officials there are many more people in that ISIS network.

Heightened Emphasis on Lone-Wolf Attacks

What makes officials even more concerned is that ISIS is encouraging Muslims to attack the West during the month of Ramadan. The Islamic holy month began on June 5 and ends on July 5, roughly the same period as Euro 2016. Ramadan is a time when observant Muslims fast from sunup to sundown as a way to remember the first Quranic revelation to Mohammed. It is seen as a month for self-sacrifice, which is why ISIS chose it as a way to inspire jihad.

ISIS spokesman Abu Mohammad al-Adnani said in May that anyone who dies in an act of jihad during Ramadan will receive a greater reward in heaven. ISIS is particularly encouraging lone-wolf attacks. The group knows these are easier to pull off than what they did in Belgium, which involved coordination and extensive planning. ISIS called for attacks on America and Europe, urging its followers not to focus on military or “hard” targets, because these are much harder to hit. Instead they told them to just strike, as one jihadist leader in France put it, “n’importe qui”: no matter who.

The Düsseldorf plot and ISIS’ call for lone-wolf attacks are once again raising fears that ISIS members may have come to Europe during the migrant crisis last year. At the time, German officials and everyone on the Left insisted refugees aren’t terrorists just because they’re coming from Muslim countries. Of course, it wasn’t the refugees themselves that most were concerned with. It was the bad actors who would take advantage of the chaos to slip into Europe. We already know that one of the Paris attackers did just that. Two of the Düsseldorf gang came from Syria as well.

But leaders in Europe don’t want to talk about that—and this gets to the heart of why we’re going to keep seeing attacks like Paris.

Political Correctness Is Killing Us

They don’t want to admit that a policy about immigration from war-torn Syria and Iraq might destabilize their countries and lead to mass casualties, because it’s not politically correct to do so. Anything that even hints at negative comments toward minority groups, especially migrants, is seen as too heinous for words. So prime ministers and presidents across the continent, and the Atlantic, fall over themselves to reassure the world of 100 percent acceptance of everyone. No questions asked.

They also don’t want to talk about the effects of a sudden influx of Middle Eastern men. When mass sexual assaults occurred in Cologne and across Germany on New Year’s Eve, the victims described the hundreds of attackers as Middle Eastern and North African. But the government hushed it up, trying to ignore the reality they had created. What happened didn’t fit in with their narrative that we are all citizens of the world with the same values and beliefs. So they lied and said it had nothing to do with the migrant crisis. They stuck to their mantra of absolute acceptance.

We have the same problem in America, although we haven’t experienced the same mass arrival of Syrian and Iraqi refugees. Here, our leaders, most notably President Obama, relentlessly ignore the realities of radical Islam. Islamic terrorism isn’t just about “hatred,” as he often tells us it is, but about actual religious beliefs. Obama likes to talk about the dangers of “extremism” but never about Islamism. The radical branch of Islam that inspires ISIS might not represent the majority of Muslims, but to dismiss it as “fringe” dangerously underplays the threat it poses, something that sadly hit home over the weekend in Florida.

We aren’t even supposed to talk about these things. David Petraeus, former head of the Central Intelligence Agency, wrote in the Washington Post last month that we should avoid any rhetoric that is offensive to Muslims. His flawed logic is that it will encourage more radicalization.

Obama, in his statement on Sunday about the Orlando shooting, talked mostly of the LGBT community and gun control. Although he admitted that the FBI is treating the attack as terrorism, he didn’t express any concern over a chronic problem occurring in America and Europe or a realization that it’s all connected by one thing—a dangerous religious ideology that ISIS’s territorial claims legitimize.

This approach must stop. Our leaders don’t have the luxury of being politically correct. Their job is to be clear-eyed about national security and the things that threaten it. They don’t get to live in a fantasy world where no one gets their feelings hurt. That doesn’t mean they should make brash and simplistic statements about banning Muslims, like Donald Trump has done, and we certainly don’t want our leaders encouraging racist and xenophobic views. But they need to stop going out of their way to deny and ignore the problems lying at their feet—no matter how uncomfortable it makes them.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/06/13/our-leaders-must-look-at-islamism-without-flinching/,2016-06-13
The Orlando Attack Is The Price Of Not Destroying ISIS,"In the wake of the Orlando terrorist attack, which left 50 dead and for which ISIS claimed responsibility on Sunday, there’s one question we probably will not debate seriously: whether we should return to the Bush doctrine and shut down terrorist safe havens overseas, and specifically whether we should deploy troops to the Middle East to destroy ISIS.

Instead, gun control and anti-gay bigotry will be the going concerns, especially among our liberal and media elite in the days ahead, just as they were in the hours after the attack. Partisans on the Left believe they can bend those aspects to their advantage in domestic political battles, and that’s what they’ll talk about.

Indeed, it only took President Barack Obama a few minutes in his remarks Sunday afternoon to suggest that one of the proper responses to Orlando would be to pass stricter gun-control measures. This is one of the president’s favorite talking points after a “mass shooting,” regardless of who does the shooting or why. It matters little that the shooter, Omar Mateen, was armed with firearms he appears to have acquired legally, or that he was a licensed security guard and thus wasn’t the type of person who would be denied a firearm even under a far stricter gun control regime.

Obama Doesn’t Think Terrorism Is A Big Deal

No matter. We will hear more about gun control. But we won’t hear the president announce a new foreign policy to defeat ISIS because on a fundamental level Obama think these kinds of terrorist attacks are an acceptable price to pay for American nonintervention in the Middle East.

A passage from Jeffery Goldberg’s lengthy piece in the April edition of The Atlantic, “The Obama Doctrine,” captures the essence of Obama’s thinking about ISIS and radical Islamic terrorism generally. In the immediate aftermath of the Paris attacks last November, Obama, who had been on a globe-spanning presidential trip when the attacks occurred, was lambasted for failing to understand the fear among many Americans that something like that might happen here. But there was a reason Obama appeared to be unmoved, and it wasn’t just jet lag. Goldberg goes on to note that Obama

has never believed that terrorism poses a threat to America commensurate with the fear it generates. Even during the period in 2014 when ISIS was executing its American captives in Syria, his emotions were in check. Valerie Jarrett, Obama’s closest adviser, told him people were worried that the group would soon take its beheading campaign to the U.S. ‘They’re not coming here to chop our heads off,’ he reassured her. Obama frequently reminds his staff that terrorism takes far fewer lives in America than handguns, car accidents, and falls in bathtubs do.

Obama’s courtiers in the media often parrot this talking point, in some cases explicitly following the president’s instructions to tally up the number of Americans who’ve been killed by terrorist attacks and compare them to the number of those killed by gun violence. It’s a useful exercise if you want to minimize the threat of terrorism and push for stricter gun control, but it doesn’t do much to address the central problem of radical Islamic terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.

That, of course, was precisely what the Bush doctrine tried to address in the wake of 9/11. The idea was that terrorist safe havens could not be allowed to persist anywhere in the world, especially in distant and largely ungoverned places like Afghanistan, where Al Qaeda had ample time to marshal resources and plan attacks. We would have to go over there, not just for revenge but specifically to preempt future plots against the West. “We’re going to smoke them out,” President Bush said a week after 9/11, adding, “The Taliban must take my statements seriously.” Two weeks later, American and British forces were bombing Taliban and Al Qaeda forces in northern Afghanistan.

Obama, elected partly on a promise to end America’s post-9/11 wars and bring troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan, effectively repudiated this doctrine. He withdrew U.S. forces from Iraq in 2011 and formally ended combat operations in Afghanistan in 2014. In both cases, Obama claimed the governments of those countries could, with minimal assistance from America, deal with the terrorist groups still operating in their countries. Of course, we still have troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the numbers of U.S. soldiers deployed in combat roles have been quietly increasing as it becomes clear that those governments are not up to the task of fighting ISIS and a resurgent Taliban.

The Case For Wiping Out ISIS

There is, of course, a strong argument for deploying a substantial number of ground troops to Iraq and Syria and wiping out ISIS once and for all. The mere existence of the group emboldens radical Muslims and ISIS sympathizers across the globe, who don’t seem to care if ISIS fighters are losing ground in Syria and Iraq. The perception is that they are ascendant. After all, they have survived this long, defying the United States and other western powers that have called for their destruction but been unwilling to carry it out.

Arguably, destroying ISIS would show the Mateens of the world that ISIS is a lost cause. Like the San Bernardino shooters Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, Mateen was inspired by ISIS but likely had no direct contact with the group. He allegedly called 911 just before he launched his attack and pledged allegiance to ISIS, and indeed may have been thinking about something like this for years. The FBI investigated him twice, in 2013 and 2014, after he implied to co-workers that he had ties to terrorists.

For its part, ISIS has encouraged these kind of attacks against civilians, and will continue to do so. It might turn out that a man armed with guns and explosives, whom the FBI arrested Sunday and who admitted he was planning to attend a gay pride parade in Los Angeles, was also inspired by ISIS. It might turn out that we see much more of this in the coming weeks, since ISIS has encouraged its followers to carry out attacks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which goes until July 5.

But no matter how many Orlandos or San Bernardinos we have, it will not convince Obama that radical Islamic terrorism is enough of a threat to justify the cost of denying terrorist groups safe haven overseas. More to the point, returning to some version of the Bush doctrine doesn’t help Obama in his domestic political battles, which are the true objects of his foreign policy. But there is a cost to that, too, and we are likely to keep paying it in American lives lost—not overseas, but here at home.

13 Of The Stupidest Things Said About The Orlando Attack,"As the news broke about the terrorist attack in Orlando, the deadliest strike on U.S. soil since 9/11, a lot of people were quick to say some really stupid things on TV about what happened.

On MSNBC, Jim Cavanaugh suggested the attack was probably “domestic terror” from “white hate groups.”

In response to Hugh Hewitt’s assertion on “Meet The Press” that ISIS would kill 100 million Americans if they could, Joy Ann Reid declared, “But so would white nationalists!”

“We’re not getting to the core issue — which is how easy it is to get a gun,” Reid said later. “Florida happens to have the largest gun-owning population in the country and some of the most lax laws as to how you can get your hands on even an assault rifle.”

Federal law requires all gun dealers in the state of Florida, and everywhere else, to conduct background checks before selling firearms. The terrorist in Orlando purchased his weapons from a licensed gun dealer and Reid said. “Florida happens to have the largest gun-owning population in the country and some of the most lax laws as to how you can get your hands on even an assault rifle.”

“We don’t have any dialogue in America about all these mass shootings,” said Tom Brokaw, conflating an obvious terrorist attack by a radical Islamist jihadi with shootings perpetrated by individuals who have been adjudicated as being mentally ill. Brokaw also demanded that the federal government ban the “AR-14,” a gun that does not actually exist.

“In this country we should not be selling automatic weapons,” Bernie Sanders said, despite the fact that an automatic weapon was not used by the Orlando terrorist.

Perhaps Congress should consider banning high capacity hot takes from unlicensed individuals who haven’t passed a simple gun knowledge background check. After all, everyone knows the First Amendment only protects the right to disseminate information via the types of pens and printing presses that were available in 18th century America.

What If Mateen Wasn’t Targeting Gay People At All?,"As Rahm Emanuel famously said, “Never let a serious crisis go to waste.”

In the immediate aftermath of the Orlando nightclub massacre, a narrative quickly emerged among liberal and media elites that “anti-gay” GOP lawmakers, white Christians, and the National Rifle Association were as much to blame for the attack as the shooter, Omar Mateen, and ISIS, which claimed responsibility for the attack.

That would certainly serve the partisan interests of the Left. And if Mateen wasn’t targeting gay people at all, that would really throw a wrench in the works.

Zack Ford got right to the point over at ThinkProgress: “Conservatives Try To Scapegoat Islam To Avoid Responsibility For Perpetuating Anti-LGBT Violence.” A headline at The Daily Beast sputtered, “GOP Homophobes Suddenly Find A Use For Gays.” Glenn Greenwald ranted, “Stop Exploiting LGBT Issues to Demonize Islam and Justify Anti-Muslim Policies.”

CNN’s Sally Kohn wasted no time comparing right-wing Christians to radical Muslims, tweeting, “Hey right wing Christians desperately trying to point out that right wing Muslims are more anti-gay than you are: Your guilt is showing!” And: “Last I checked, it’s not Muslim religious extremists shooting up abortion clinics and killing abortion doctors.”

“Here’s what the Christian right’s got to wrestle with: They’re only a few points behind the Orlando shooter on the same political spectrum,” tweeted Sarah Jones of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.

More abstractly, “toxic masculinity” was also to blame. “Overcompensation Nation: It’s time to admit that toxic masculinity drives gun violence,” declared a headline at Salon. Another at ThinkProgress announced “The Role Of Toxic Masculinity In Mass Shootings.”

It wasn’t just the fault of Christians and masculinity. Guns and gun rights groups were also to blame. Hollywood luminaries Seth MacFarlane and Susan Sarandon, showing how little they know about firearms, incoherently called for a ban on “automatic weapons.” Even The New York Times’ Roger Cohen got in on the action, musing that “Mateen demonstrated again just how potent the mix of ISIS and National Rifle Association ideology is.”

Mateen Said Nothing About Punishing Gay People

But what if Mateen didn’t specifically target a gay nightclub? What if the choice of the club and the victims were incidental to the killer’s intent? What if Mateen simply hated America, loved ISIS, considered himself an Islamist, and wanted to kill as many infidels as possible?

Why else would Mateen have scouted out other locations like Walt Disney World? Could it be that this, too, is a place where large numbers of people gather and where Mateen could have launched a surprise attack against unsuspecting civilians? Mateen’s wife, Noor Sahi Salman, reportedly told People that recently he had been “scouting Downtown Disney and Pulse [nightclub] for attacks.” Downtown Disney, reports People, doesn’t have a security and bag check at the entrance, unlike the other four Disney World theme parks.

If Mateen’s specific purpose had been to target not just Americans, but gay Americans, why did he never mention this in his 911 call? According to multiple law enforcement sources, Mateen called 911 about 30 minutes after launching his attack and pledged allegiance to ISIS and its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

But that’s not all he said. Mateen claimed he was doing this in solidarity with Boston marathon bombers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, and Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, the first U.S. citizen to carry out a suicide attack in Syria. He also said he was protesting “the U.S. bombing in Syria and Iraq and the killing of women and children.”

No mention of carrying out an Islamic punishment for homosexuality, no mention of gay or lesbian Americans, no mention of his victims at all. Of course, it’s no secret that Islam condemns homosexuality, and that ISIS has executed gay men by throwing them from rooftops in Mosul. So it’s possible that Mateen decided to attack Pulse, a well-known gay nightclub, to carry out a punishment he believed Islam demands for homosexuality.

But in light of the going media narrative, that Mateen specifically targeted a gay nightclub because of his hatred of homosexuality, it seems a rather significant omission on his part. It would also undermine a plot that the Left and the mainstream media want desperately to advance. If the Orlando massacre turns out to be just another terrorist attack by a radical Muslim who hates the West and loves ISIS, what use would it be as a domestic political weapon?

Why Islamists Hate Homosexuals,"On June 12, the free world woke up to the shocking news that no fewer than 50 people were killed and more than 50 people were injured at the Pulse gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. The attack is the worst mass shooting in American history, and the deadliest terror attack that has occurred since 9/11.

The perpetrator was a 29-year-old Islamist named Omar Mateen, a U.S. citizen of Afghan descent who was residing in Port Saint Lucie, Florida. Mateen is reported to have pledged allegiance to ISIS, and was previously monitored by the FBI for his extremist proclivities. It is now quite clear that the mass shooting was yet another Islamist terror attack. There can be no doubt: Mateen was motivated to attack a gay nightclub because he believed this was a righteous Islamic cause of jihad fi-sabeel al-lah (in the path of God).

It is noteworthy that this attack comes on the heels of the “That They Live by Proof” Arabic audio recording released by ISIS spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani on May 21. In it, Al-Adnani called for attacks against the United States and Europe during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan (it has now been a week since Ramadan began). He reminded the “fighters and supporters of the Caliphate in Europe and America” that Ramadan is “the month of conquest and jihad.” Al-Adnani exhorted those who would heed his incitements to “Get prepared, be ready…to make it a month of calamity everywhere for the non-believers.”

Al-Adnani had a track record of being taken very seriously by Islamists. Only 18 days after he called for attacks against Russia in 2015, ISIS militants brought down the Russian Metrojet Flight 9268. Three weeks after Al-Adnani’s call to jihad during Ramadan, Mateen may have seen it fit to heed it.

It’s Not Crazy To Point to Islam

In light of this macabre attack, apologists for Islam will no doubt take to the microphones to boldly proclaim that all the world must be wary of Islamophobia and of unduly blaming all Muslims for the “senseless and nihilistic” crimes of a few. This, however, is an egregious straw man of the position of those who have legitimate grievances with Islam. Hardly any rational person believes that all Muslims are responsible for the actions of the relatively few people who perpetrate attacks like this.

Indeed, judging a religious population of more than 1.3 billion by the actions of some Islamists is unfair and absurd—but hardly any rational person, no matter how anti-Islam, believes that. Rather, many rational and well-intentioned people, now both on the Right and the Left (although still mostly on the Right), are concerned about the inherent tendencies towards violence and intolerance that are latent in the mainstream Islamic religion itself.

Although supporters of extremist Islamist groups make up a relatively small percentage of the total Muslim population, this leads to underestimating the scope of the Islamist problem. In absolute numbers, more than 60 million Muslims the world over, a population roughly equal to that of the United Kingdom, holds a favorable view towards ISIS. Millions more are unsure about whether they hold a favorable or unfavorable view towards ISIS, according to Pew research.

So when events like this occur, people who raise religious concerns do not blame all Muslims, but blame the religious ideology that motivates such hatred, a religious ideology that ultimately has roots in the Islamic source texts themselves. Fair-minded commentators, therefore, do not dismiss such murderous actions as nihilistic crimes against humanity. Rather, they understand the murderers are motivated not by a nihilistic urge for violence, but by cold and calculated reasoning that runs deep in the Islamic source texts and traditions. These source texts and traditions provide the fertile breeding ground for people like Mateen.

Yes, This Does Have to Do With Islam

Nevertheless, in the coming days we will certainly be told again and again by Islam’s apologists that “this crime has nothing to do with Islam.” Indeed, this propaganda battle has already begun. It has been reported that Mateen’s father, Mir Siddique, said that his son’s horrific slaughter “had nothing do with religion.” Siddique claims mere homophobic bigotry led his son to perpetrate such a heinous crime. He explains that one time his son became angry when two homosexual men kissed in front of him.

The topic of what motivates Islamic extremism is very important to our national security; therefore, it is paramount that one be able to set aside one’s emotion in investigating this. As we have seen this week, many lives are literally on the line. One must be able to fearlessly look into the well of history and accept it for what it is, not for what one wishes it to be. As the saying goes, one cannot change the past, but must learn from it.

On May 9, 2016, ISIS thugs blindfolded an unidentified man and threw him off a five-story building in Manbij, a city in the Aleppo province of Syria. A mob of hundreds of people, including children, gathered below the building to witness this execution. Repugnantly, the mob stoned the victim’s body after it hit the ground, probably to make sure he was dead, if not to symbolically partake in the execution.

This was not the first time ISIS committed such an act, for it executed a number of homosexuals in Mosul and in Raqqa this way. Sunday we witnessed an Islamist who had declared his allegiance to ISIS gun down many people at a gay nightclub in Florida.

There is a pattern in the way ISIS and its supporters execute those it alleges are homosexual: ISIS usually, although not always, has them thrown off of tall buildings. As inhumane as these executions may be, murdering homosexuals in this way does not come from a nihilistic urge for carnage. No, these are cold and calculated steps taken by murderers who believe they serve God through such acts.

Theological Reasons for Islamists’ Hostility to Homosexuals

Indeed, it can be argued that executing homosexuals by such means as throwing them off high buildings is motivated by a fairly prevalent Islamic tradition. To understand why ISIS takes part in such vile acts, it is necessary to understand the reasons ISIS itself, as a self-declared Islamic caliphate, invokes in performing such acts. What follows is a brief analysis of the theological reasons for ISIS and Islamists’ animosity towards homosexuals.

First, there is relatively good evidence that Islam prohibits homosexual acts. This can be gleaned from reading the Qur’an (Q 15:73; 7:80-82; 26:165-175; 27:55-58; 29:28-29), which talks about the punishment that God visited upon the “people of Lot,” which the Qur’an takes to be a lecherous people who participated in homosexual acts, echoing the Biblical story of Lot’s visit to Sodom and Gomorrah in the Old Testament (see Genesis 19).

Indeed, in Muhammad Malik’s English translation of the Qur’an, the comment on Q 15:73, which talks about two angels’ visitation to the people of Lot, reads as follows: “The same angels came to Prophet [Lot] and executed Allah’s decree of stoning to death the nation of homosexuals.” So strong is the association with the people of Lot and homosexuality that it has become common among Arabs to call a homosexual male by the pejorative term “Loti” (لوطي), after the prophet Lot’s namesake. (The non-pejorative term is “مثلي”.)

Furthermore, that Islam prohibits homosexual acts is also relatively uncontroversial among Islamic scholars. Only in recent memory do you have the emergence of a handful of openly homosexual imams, and even then this novelty is an exclusively Western phenomenon. So ISIS has good grounds for taking homosexual actions to be sinful.

It is not implausible for Muslims to interpret these hadith to mean they should treat homosexuals with contempt.

Second, there is a hadith in “Sahih Al-Bukhari,” the most trusted collection of Sunni ahadeeth, where Muhammad curses “effeminate men.” It reads as follows: “The Prophet cursed effeminate men [those men who are in the similitude or assume the manners of women] and those women who assume the manners of men, and he said, ‘Expel them out of your houses.’ The Prophet expelled out such-and-such a man, and `Umar expelled such-and-such a woman.”

This hadith does not go so far as to recommend that homosexuals be killed, but it does provide fodder for Islamists who want to persecute homosexuals. It is not implausible for Muslims to interpret the above hadith to mean they should treat homosexuals with contempt. Indeed, Mateen’s contempt for the homosexual men who kissed in front of him, as reported by his father, seems to be perfectly in keeping with the spirit of the above hadith.

ISIS’s Favorite Homosexual Hadiths

Third, a prominent hadith (saying) attributed to Muhammad mandates the death penalty for partakers of homosexual acts. However, to my knowledge only one such hadith is considered reliable by Muslim scholars, and it is not found in the two Sahih collections (“Sahih Muslim” and “Sahih Al-Bukhari”), the two most trusted collections of ahadeeth. The only textual evidence in the (relied-upon) ahadeeth that talks about the punishment for homosexuality can be traced back to a hadith in “Musnad Ahmad,” a collection of ahadeeth that is attributed to Ahmad ibn Hanbal (c. 780 – 855 A.D.), the founder of the Hanbali school of jurisprudence, one of the four most prominent schools in Sunni Islam.

While there is a consensus amongst Muslim scholars that homosexual acts are sinful, there is no consensus about the proper punishment of such acts.

The hadith has Muhammad saying that “whomever you find doing the actions of the people of Lot, kill the one doing it, and the one it is done to.”[1] ISIS has invoked this hadith on multiple occasions in carrying out its executions. It is the most prominent anti-homosexual text in Islam.

Fourth, a contemptuous attitude towards homosexuals is found in some prominent and authoritative Islamic manuals of jurisprudence, like “Umdat As-Salik,” or “The Reliance of the Traveler,” an authoritative manual of Shafi’i jurisprudence written by the fourteenth-century Islamicist Ahmad ibn Naqib al-Misri (1302–1367). The section on “sodomites” in “Umdat As-Salik” cites the above hadith, along with two others found in the hadith collections of Ibn Hibban and At-Tabarani (two collections that come after the six canonical Sunni ones). They are, respectively, as follows (Book P (كتاب الكبائر), sec. 17.3): “May Allah curse him who does what Lot’s people did” and “Lesbianism by women is adultery between them.”

Fifth, while there is a consensus amongst Muslim scholars that homosexual acts are sinful, there is no consensus about the proper punishment of such acts. Some Muslim scholars, including early ones, reject the above hadith on killing homosexuals as having a weak isnad, or chain of transmission, and therefore judge it to be unreliable. The scholars’ beliefs here reflect the multiple traditions relating what the companions of Muhammad believed vis-à-vis homosexuality.

Some traditions relate that Ibn Abbas, Muhammad’s cousin, said homosexuals should be thrown off the highest place in a city. Other traditions, like those attributed to Ali ibn Abi Talib (the cousin of Muhammad and the fourth “rightly guided” caliph), and Abu Bakr, the first “rightly guided caliph,” record that homosexuals should be burned to death.

It’s Not Just ISIS That Despises Homosexuality

Given the aforementioned texts, ISIS’s reasoning is quite simple here: true Islam is the Islam that was practiced in its first three generations: the generation of the Messenger Muhammad, the generation of the companions of Muhammad (الصحابة), and the generation of the followers of the companions (التابعون). Since in these generations Muslims executed homosexuals, today homosexuals, the analogy goes, should be executed as well; in particular, they should be executed in ways that resemble how they were killed in the three aforementioned generations.

Given the aforementioned texts, ISIS’s reasoning is quite simple here: true Islam is the Islam that was practiced in its first three generations.

One such manner of execution is that attributed to Ibn Abbas: throwing homosexuals off rooftops. ISIS believes this is in keeping with what was practiced in the first three and best generations of Islam, as is clear from what is released in its videos and published in Dabiq (Dabiq is the name for ISIS’s English magazine).

These are some of the fundamental motivations behind the Islamist contempt for homosexuals. This Islamic animosity towards homosexuals has become ingrained in contemporary Muslim society, as can be discerned from many polls. For example, Pew Research has found that overwhelming majorities of the people surveyed in Muslim-majority countries state that society should reject homosexuality. The relevant numbers include 97 percent in Jordan, 95 percent in Egypt, 94 percent in Tunisia, 93 percent in the Palestinian territories, 93 percent in Indonesia, 87 percent in Pakistan, 86 percent in Malaysia, 80 percent in Lebanon, and 78 percent in Turkey.

But it is not just Muslims in Muslim-majority countries who have a very low view of homosexuality. A recent poll, for example, found that 52 percent of British Muslims believe homosexuality should not even be legal, compared with just 5 percent of the general British population who believe this (and it is not implausible to suppose that a significant part of that 5 percent is comprised of Muslims). In addition, many Muslim-majority countries—such as Yemen, Iran, Iraq, Mauritania, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and the United Arab Emirates—have laws that contain strict hudud or punishments of homosexual acts, including penalties like imprisonment, flogging, and execution.

Is There Any Ground for Reformist Muslims?

All this being said, reformist-minded Muslims may want to utilize historical curiosities present throughout Islamic history in their well-intentioned but perhaps overly optimistic attempt at reforming Islam. One such historical curiosity is the abundant evidence that, following the reign of the four rightly-guided caliphs, some Ummayyad and Abbasid caliphs led lecherous lives, and even flaunted their homosexual preferences and welcomed homosexuals to their courts.

At the peak of Islamic civilization homosexuality was relatively tolerated in at least certain segments of society.

Indeed, the famous Abbasid poet Abu Nuwas (756 – 814 A.D.), Caliph Haroun al-Rashid’s favorite court poet, was a rake and lecher who wrote on wine, pederasty, and male love. Thus, at the peak of Islamic civilization homosexuality was relatively tolerated in at least certain segments of society and perhaps even celebrated at the caliphal court.

Of course, ISIS and like-minded Salafi-Islamist groups see this is a blot in Islamic history and a deviation from the rightly-guided path (الصراط المستقيم) that the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphs should have inherited from as-salaf as-salih (the good predecessors). “Salafis,” a designation literally denoting “those who follow the predecessors,” seek to restore Islam to the times of as-salaf as-salih. They yearn to bring the Muslim umma (nation) back to the days, traditions, and practices of the first three generations of Islam. This is ultimately their architectonic goal.

Although the condemnation of homosexual acts has relatively strong textual basis in Islam, the same cannot be said about the appropriate punishment for such acts. Further, as we have seen, anti-homosexual sentiment was not always shared in the highest places of Islamic power. The ahadeeth and other traditions are also not founded upon bedrock historical truth, as they come long after the death of Muhammad. Indeed, pace what Muslim scholars believe, most of the ahadeeth, inciting violence or otherwise, very likely do not originate from Muhammad.[2] In addition, early Muslim scholars themselves disagree about whether the foundational hadith text mandating the execution of homosexuals is considered reliable.

Mateen and his Islamist ilk are actors on a stage that goes back more than a millennium. It is paramount that national security officials realize this and educate themselves on the Islamic sources and tradition from which Mateen and his cohorts draw inspiration. Moreover, as we have seen, reformist-minded Muslims have leeway, even within their own Islamic paradigms, to consign these anti-homosexual traditions to the dustbins of history.

[1] This hadith is copied in other hadith collections, particularly in the canonical Sunan collections—viz., in Sunan Al-Tirdmidhi, Sunan Abi Dawood, and Sunan Ibn Majah, which are all part of the Sahih Sittah, the six most trusted collections of Sunni ahadeeth. Furthermore, there is another hadith found in Sunan Abu Dawood that says the following: “If a man who is not married is seized committing sodomy, he will be stoned to death. Abu Dawud said: The tradition of ‘Asim proved the tradition of ‘Amir b. Abi ‘Amr as weak.” However, is in mentioned in note in the hadith, it is not considered to be reliable.

You Won’t Believe How Chick-Fil-A Responded To The Orlando Attack,"In the wake of the Orlando terrorist attack, the worst strike on U.S. soil since 9/11, employees at Chick-Fil-A restaurants in the Orlando area performed an incredible act of kindness.

The franchise, which is known for being closed on Sundays to allow its workers to spend time with their families and attend church, was supposed to be shuttered on the day of the tragedy. But hours after the attack that killed 50 people and injured at least 53 more, Chick-Fil-A employees went to work on their day off to provide free food for those waiting in line to donate blood for the victims of the attack.

The chicken restaurant has been on the receiving end of boycotts several times for its support of traditional marriage. But the chain’s political affiliations didn’t stop its employees from helping out the victims of the deadly attack at a gay nightclub.

Another Orlando-based Chick-Fil-A store, whose employees also pitched in on Sunday to feed blood donors, posted a photo of their flag at half-staff with a message of solidarity for the victims.

“Our restaurant, along with a couple of others in the area, simply responded just like numerous other Orlando businesses and residents have done — we came together as a community to lift those in need,” the restaurant stated in the comments section of the photo.

5 Takeaways From Trump’s Response To Orlando,"I was having Mexican for lunch with friends on a beautiful sunny Silicon Valley afternoon. My enchiladas were excellent, as was the conversation. Then I happened to glance up at the TV, and CNN was on with breaking news. I couldn’t hear it, but the headline scrolling by at the bottom read “50 killed in Orlando shooting. Shooter born in New York, parents from Afghanistan. Shooter claimed allegiance to ISIS in 911 call.”

We’d been hit again. It sank in.

I already knew what the liberal response would be. They would blame Republicans and conservatives, Christians, and the National Rifle Association. No surprise there, even though it was not a Christian, but a Muslim and registered Democrat who carried out the attack. But why let little things like facts get in the way?

Yet I was most curious to see how Donald Trump would respond. Would he reiterate his call for a ban on Muslim immigration—which some have called racist, Islamophobic, and unbecoming of a presidential candidate? Or would he back down and embrace political correctness in order to placate his critics and seem more presidential?

Trump answered my curiosity with his national security speech the Monday following the attack. Let’s look at five key takeaways from his talk.

1. The Orlando Attacks Legitimized Trump’s Message

Trump’s simple solution of temporarily banning immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States already made sense to many Americans. Now, after the Orlando attack, his argument will seem even more like common sense and less like an extreme solution. You can bet the “ban” will be the topic of discussion at many dinner tables and coffee break rooms all around America this week, in a much more substantive way than before Orlando.

2. Trump Got Elegant

Trump chose not to capitulate, but to reiterate. He repeated his ban on immigration from Muslim countries, but this time stating it in a much more elegant fashion, replacing “Muslim countries” with “areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States.” This more-sophisticated phrasing sounds more measured and reasoned, will be palatable to more Americans, and will be harder to attack for being intolerant.

3. Trump Tied the Orlando Attack to Immigration

Trump successfully tied the terrorist attack to our immigration system, which allowed the killer’s father to enter the United States even though he supports the Taliban and is from a country with a proven history of terrorism. Trump showed that inviting the wrong people to our country can have disastrous impact, even in the second generation. Critically, he showed that the much-touted rigorous background screening done on immigrants simply cannot be relied upon, as evidenced by not only Orlando but also San Bernardino. All this will let Trump show that his immigration policies could have prevented this attack.

4. Trump Tied the Orlando Attack to Political Correctness

Trump argued that political correctness stifled the FBI’s response to the attack. Indeed, we know the FBI had investigated the Orlando terrorist on multiple occasions, yet no action was taken. This was ostensibly due to fears of being seen as anti-Islam, and due to FBI agents receiving ineffective, politically correct training on Islam. Thus, by tying political correctness to the government’s failure to stop a known terrorist suspect, Trump has strengthened his positioning as the only candidate who won’t let political correctness stand in the way of protecting Americans.

5. Trump Differentiated Himself

Trump argued that President Obama and Hillary Clinton support increased immigration from countries known to support terrorism; that they refuse to release the immigration history of known terrorists in the United States; that political correctness prevents them from taking action against Islamic terrorism; and that border control is better than gun control. This is the exact opposite of Hillary’s position. These policies clearly differentiate Trump from Hillary, and make him appear stronger on terrorism.

All in all, Trump skillfully responded to Orlando, articulating his core message in a more sophisticated way than before, yet without losing any of the sting and unorthodoxy that people love (and hate) so much. I can’t wait to see if upcoming poll numbers reflect a bump in support, as I’m expecting.

Anderson Cooper’s Orlando Ranting Is Bad For America,"Many members of the nation’s elite media and political institutions have not exactly covered themselves with glory in the days following the ISIS attack on Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Early on Sunday morning, a Florida man who repeatedly explained that his terrorism was in support of ISIS, an Islamist terrorist organization, murdered 49 of his fellow Americans and injured several dozen more at a gay nightclub.

This is the second extremely successful ISIS attack on American soil and the biggest U.S. terror attack since Al Qaeda bombed the United States with four airplanes in 2001. The December 2015 terror attack in San Bernardino was also done on behalf of ISIS, whose model encourages independent action against Western interests and people. Information and encouragement are provided generally over the Internet, and independent members pledge their support only upon commencement of their terrorism.

As The New York Times’ ISIS reporter Rukmini Callimachi has explained, the “lone wolf” strategy employed by the San Bernardino and Orlando terrorists was conceived at least six years ago by Al Qaeda but executed best by Islamic State, which is better at social media and inspiring mentally disturbed individuals such as Orlando terrorist Omar Mateen. Of course, Daveed Gartentstein-Ross notes that authorities can overdo “lone wolf” designations, thereby failing to see ISIS network connections that aren’t immediately obvious.

ISIS readily accepted Mateen’s pledge of support, and the group’s social media accounts have been pushing the Orlando shooting as a model for other lone wolf jihadists to follow. Far too many in the media have decided that the reality of what transpired and what it portends is too difficult to deal with and challenges too many of their strongly held assumptions and political positions. Instead, they chose to use this tragedy to target their own political enemies.

Far too many in the media have used this tragedy to target their own political enemies.

Based on information we have as of now, Mateen was a longtime supporter of terrorism, having cheered 9/11 — on 9/11! — according to his high school classmates who witnessed his response. He was married twice and had a son but also propositioned men on gay dating apps and in real life, according to some reporters. In fact, he was a longtime Pulse patron, witnesses say. He had cased Disneyland and other populated places before deciding on Pulse. He’s a radicalized Muslim who scared former colleagues with violent rhetoric and claims of terrorist ties. The FBI repeatedly investigated him, but nothing came of it. He was a domestic abuser, according to his ex-wife. He was a registered Democrat and son of an anti-American politician.

Despite all that, the media and others on the Left decided to cover this terrorist attack by going after people who support self-government and its Second Amendment; people who pray to God in times of tragedy; people who believe the definition of marriage is the union of one man and one woman; people who accept the biological reality and implications of distinct sexes; people who are Republican; people who are traditional Christians; and so on and so forth. The media followed up by cheerleading this incivility.

It is probably most charitable to view this process as a reflection of the media’s inability to deal with its own grief. This is a general societal problem, as the recent shooting of the gorilla Harambe showed. We don’t have the vocabulary for expressing sadness in the fallen world, resorting immediately to blame and politicization of tragedy to help us cope and feel more secure.

This Is the Media’s Religious Response

The religious ritual the media is most devoted to post-terrorism (or other shooting incident) is the liturgical plea to restrict the Second Amendment. Sometimes there are additional rituals. Insofar as victims are from the same side as the media in a culture clash, they use tragedy as a means to bludgeon people on the other side of the clash. So here, where the victims of the Islamist terrorist were at a gay club, we have seen the ritual denunciation of anyone who opposes the declared writ and doctrines of the sexual revolution. There’s a Muslim-sized loophole in this denunciation, by which I mean that Muslims are silently (if deafeningly!) excused from the media’s opprobrium. We’re learning post-Orlando that this is the case even when the sole perpetrator of the terrorism is himself Muslim.

This is not an exaggeration. The Daily Beast was quick out of the gate with a Paul Ryan-is-the-real-monster-of-Orlando approach. The New York Times ran a lengthy editorial pinning the blame for Orlando on Republicans for their views on marriage redefinition. Really. Stephen Hayes’ critique of the editorial, which did not mention Islam, is worth a read:

The entire editorial is an extended non-sequitur, a paroxysm of partisanship unworthy of publication in America’s paper of record — unworthy of publication, for that matter, in Salon or even the comments section of a left-wing website. It’s an utter embarrassment.

And yet even in this context of pious displacement of reality, CNN’s Anderson Cooper stands out. On Tuesday, he “absolutely grilled” Florida attorney general Pam Bondi. Her crime? She was helping victims of the terrorism, even though she had defended Florida voters in litigation against redefining marriage to include same-sex couples. Florida’s very constitution defined marriage as the union of man and woman, and she wrote court briefs explaining the harm caused by redefining marriage into something else.

Cooper believes very strongly that it’s hypocritical, in any way, to support the idea that marriage is ontologically the union of man and woman while also believing that gay people should not be murdered by Islamist terrorists. So he took issue with her advocacy of victims of the terrorism. Bondi repeatedly tried to return the interview to the subject of what was being done to help victims while Cooper said things like, “Well it is gay pride month; you’ve never tweeted about gay pride month.” (Really.) He further said that legal arguments about the “harm” of redefining marriage were actually claims that “gay people are harming” Florida. He said she’d “gone after” gays and sarcastically asked her if she really thought she was a champion of the gay community. Then he repeatedly suggested that this meant she had incited the terrorist in Orlando. He was belligerent and insulting and childish.

He ended by saying he’d gone ahead and checked on her Twitter history for a year (a real life version of Seinfeld’s Wear The Ribbon sketch) and had seen no indication that she had shown proper deference to gay rights. Cooper then suggested that, in the future, she better get into line and show proper fealty to gay rights. He spoke for most of the “interview,” turning it into a petulant lecture about the importance of conformity to media elites.

Instead of asking questions in search of truth, Cooper chose to bully and dominate. Instead of an exchange of ideas — even if journalists aren’t supposed to be advocating their personal views — he tried to impose his doctrines and shame the non-conformist.

Other Media Cheer

Other media outlets ate it up. The Washington Post had a piece detailing the exchange as did The Hill. An editor at The Daily Beast thought the line of questioning was “nice.” The Daily Beast was super jazzed about the story, running several pieces on the exchange, including one from Lloyd Grove who gushed that Cooper was “uncompromising.” Indeed he was, if by uncompromising we mean “showing an unwillingness to make concessions to others, especially by changing one’s ways or opinions.”

As part of his post-grilling tour of triumph, he told a thankful New York Times with a straight face that “I’m not trying to push an agenda. I’m not here to be an advocate, railing at the top of my lungs at injustices; that’s the role other people have.” Yes, arguing repeatedly that you can’t oppose jihadist murdering of gays if you do so much as acknowledge the definition of marriage on which all societies have been based isn’t advocacy at all. Are you freaking kidding me?

A person must share the sexual groupthink of media elites to express solidarity with victims of a jihadist murderer? You’re not allowed to mourn or offer sympathies for the dead and wounded unless you support redefining marriage? That’s idiotic.

Do CNN Reporters Wish Death on Their Political Opponents?

No member of the media asked anyone opposed to religious liberty if they were hypocritical for decrying Dylann Roof’s murder of Charleston churchgoers. There was no introspection about whether CNN and other media outlets’ constant denigration and mockery of religion and religious belief had played a role in spreading the view that religious people needed to be snuffed out. New York Times reporter Jeremy Peters took time off of running interference for Nancy Pelosi to complain that Republicans weren’t mentioning that Pulse was a gay nightclub as much as they should have been. He added:

If this happened at a church & liberals weren’t calling it an attack on Christians, the right wouldn’t be outraged? https://t.co/oDZjjMYcOd

— Jeremy W. Peters (@jwpetersNYT) June 13, 2016

Except that you might recall when the black Christians were shot inside a church in Charleston by a racist, the media moved right past the victims — their religious identification and their forgiving families — in order to spend weeks obsessing on … Confederate flags. In this terrorism aftermath, no member of the mainstream media has told a single Muslim leader he has no business speaking on the Orlando tragedy given his religion’s views on sexual ethics, much less berated him and told him he would be hypocritical to do so. That type of journalism would be unthinkable.

Destroying Civility

If you want to talk about harm to America, Anderson Cooper is harming America by politicizing our present tragedy in such a grotesque fashion. He’s saying that the country can’t come together and mourn the loss of life unless they share his sexual ethics and advocate for them.

Anderson Cooper is harming America by politicizing our present tragedy in such a grotesque fashion.

How shameful that Cooper would seek to elevate identity politics over shared values during a time of national loss. Longtime media guy Lloyd Grove giddily wrote that “Anderson Cooper Is the Anchor We Need Now” because he “pulverizes conservatives.”

That’s not what we need right now. How juvenile and stupid to say that this is needed ever, much less now. My brother and I were talking on Sunday about the horrific terrorism in Orlando. He recalled how some media had tried to say Christian victims might have been partly responsible for the San Bernardino terrorism. Making the point that it would be even crazier to pass blame in this attack, he said he’d just like to see them try to transition blame. I guess our media showed him! Beginning within hours, the Left and their media allies turned an Islamist attack on hundreds of gay Americans and their friends against conservatives and Christians. It’s appalling, but at this point it’s not surprising.

As some media figures have admitted, they’re too scared to critique Islam. It’s easier to pick fights with Christians and the those who support traditional values than discuss, much less confront, Islamist violence or even just Muslim intolerance of gays. Americans don’t need groupthink encomiums in praise of Cooper or totalitarian conformity of thought, word, and deed. Cooper’s journalism is boorish and beneath him. Cooper’s little performance, and his defensiveness of same, is typical mainstream media cowardice being presented as tough journalism.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/06/16/anderson-coopers-orlando-ranting-is-bad-for-america/,2016-06-16
The Orlando Attack Is Driving Gays To Gun Stores,"After 49 people were killed an another 53 were injured by a terrorist at a gay nightclub in Orlando, gays and lesbians are taking their personal safety into their own hands.

One gun dealer in Colorado said business at his store on Tuesday was “booming,” according to a Denver Fox affiliate:

Gun shops typically see a spike in customers after mass shootings. But this time, many are seeing shoppers they’ve never really seen before: More gays and lesbians.



George Horne, the owner of The Gun Room, Denver’s oldest firearms dealer, said Tuesday business is booming at his store.



“For this time of year I’d say its three to four times what we normally have,” he said.



Background checks that once took minutes can now take hours. It’s a sales surge similar to what happened after Sandy Hook and the Aurora theater shootings.



“We’re not surprised by it,” Horne said.

The Pink Pistols, a gay-friendly shooting club that encourages LGBT people to protect themselves, had a surge of new members the day after the attack. On Sunday, the group had about 1,500 members nationwide, but by Monday the club had more than doubled and now boasts roughly 3,500 members.

“We teach queers to shoot. Then we teach others that we have done so,” the group’s website states:

Armed queers don’t get bashed. We change the public perception of the sexual minorities, such that those who have in the past perceived them as safe targets for violence and hateful acts — beatings, assaults, rapes, murders — will realize that that now, a segment of the sexual minority population is now armed and effective with those arms. Those arms are also concealed, so they do not know which ones are safe to attack, and which are not…which they can harm as they have in the past, and which may draw a weapon and fight back.

On Sunday, the Pink Pistols released a statement condemning gun control efforts being pushed by lawmakers and public figures in the wake of the attack:

The Pink Pistols gives condolences to all family and friends of those killed and injured at Pulse. This is exactly the kind of heinous act that justifies our existence. At such a time of tragedy, let us not reach for the low-hanging fruit of blaming the killer’s guns. Let us stay focused on the fact that someone hated gay people so much they were ready to kill or injure so many. A human being did this. The human being’s tools are unimportant when compared to the bleakness of that person’s soul. I say again, GUNS did not do this.

Dozens of new chapters have cropped up all across the country to accommodate all of the new members who want to learn how to protect themselves and their loved ones.

Mike Smith, a firearms instructor in Colorado Springs, said he has noticed an uptick in LGBT clients and is forming one of these new chapters, even though he himself is not gay.

“I look at it as a disenfranchised minority that needs someone who’s willing to say I’m a resource who’s here and willing to help,” he told a FOX 31 Denver.

Orlando Uncovers The Left’s Indifference To Minority Rights,"Supporters of gay rights usually look to the Left as their political sponsor and supporter, as the political faction they can count on to back them up when it matters. They had better take a closer look at the Left’s reaction to the terrorist attack at that gay nightclub in Orlando, because it shows how badly the Left is failing them.

The role of Islam in the attack is very clear. The perpetrator was the son of an Afghan Muslim immigrant who is a supporter of the Taliban. During the attack, the shooter called police to pledge allegiance to the Islamic State. So his motive is not exactly the big mystery some people are pretending it is.

It also seems likely that he was himself gay and had frequented the Pulse nightclub over a period of years, not just casing it to plan his attack, but as a regular customer. Certainly, a gay nightclub in Orlando is not the kind of target likely to be suggested by Islamic State leadership back in Syria. They would be more likely to suggest someplace with a more international profile like Disney World, which the shooter did scout. But Pulse is the kind of target the shooter picked because it has personal meaning for him.

These two motives are by no means mutually exclusive. Islam has a warped view of human sexuality, particularly in its primitive Afghan variety. (Afghanistan is a place where homosexuality has been punished by death—but pederasty is widely tolerated.) So it’s no surprise that a young Muslim from an Afghan background might find himself attracted to men, yet also feel intensely guilty about. And it’s no surprise that he would seek to atone for this supposed sin by seeking the “martyrdom” of dying in the cause of jihad. Islamist recruiters have a keen eye for just this sort of thing. The first female suicide bomber for the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas reportedly did it to atone for adultery.

Given the obvious role of Islam, what have the great defenders of the gay cause on the Left done? Totally ignored it and tried to shift the focus to something else. They’ve attempted to shift our attention away from an actual, serious threat to the freedom and personal security of gay people and onto their own preferred, pre-programmed domestic political agenda. So they have attempted to blame the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle (which was not actually used by the shooter) and, even more bizarrely, Christians.

This is nicely summed up in a little graphic passing around on Twitter to illustrate Poe’s Law, the Internet adage about how it’s impossible to tell the difference between satire of a belief and the sincere expression of it. On the Left are tweets from “Godfrey Elfwick,” a parody accounting representing the views of a stereotypical leftist “Social Justice Warrior.” On the right are tweets from an actual stereotypical Social Justice Warrior, CNN talking head Sally Kohn.

The idea, I guess, is that Kohn thinks a radical Islamist needed to learn from American Christians how to hate homosexuals—despite the fact that the death penalty for homosexuality is widely preached and practiced in the Muslim world.

So the Left will gladly protect homosexuals from the very great threat of having Christians refuse to bake cakes for their weddings. But when homosexuals are attacked by Muslims who think they should be put to death merely for existing, the Left will cover its ears and eyes and deny the threat even exists.

This is what they call a “teachable moment” for American homosexuals. They have been sold on the idea of a kind of pan-leftist alliance in which all of the different victim groups band together to fight their common oppressors. But the interests of some supposed victim groups trump the interests of others. In a contest between “homophobia” and “Islamophobia,” it turns out that the Left is more concerned with avoiding any accusation that it might be hostile to Islam.

This is just one example of the con the Left has pulled on all minority groups. It presents itself as the protector of their rights and interests, but it is actually just using them for its own agenda. The Left starts with a pre-existing animus against capitalism and Western civilization. The point of its supposed alliance of the oppressed is not to actually protect their interests but to assemble an army of malcontents to tear down the existing system. And when it becomes convenient to do so, it will sacrifice them to that agenda. From the <i>Charlie Hebdo</i> massacre to Orlando, it’s as if the Islamists have been ticking down a list of traditional liberal client groups — artists, Jews, women, gays — and attacking them, only to be met with the left’s stubborn denial and indifference.

This is not perhaps the easiest time to make this point, when the Republican Party seems determined to drive away anyone who is a member of any kind of minority. All that stuff about “outreach” that we were talking about after the 2012 election has, for the moment, been thrown into the ditch. But the underlying problem — the Left’s exploitation of minorities for its own end — has not changed, and the reaction to the Orlando shooting is a good opportunity to suggest to the victims of the Left’s minority con that perhaps they should not consent to be exploited for somebody else’s agenda.

"In Orlando, Obama Plays Dumb About The Terrorist's Motives","President Obama visited Orlando Thursday to pay his respects to the 49 people who were killed in the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil since 9/11.

In his remarks, Obama failed to mention the actual motivation for the terrorist attack: a radical Islamist terrorist who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State sought revenge against the United States for its foreign policy. In fact, Obama never once mentioned the words “Islam” or “jihad.” When the president did mention Islamist terror groups, such as ISIS and al-Qaeda, he described them not as adherents to a virulent ideology that demands genocide against non-Muslims, but as garden-variety groups that spread propaganda that sometimes influences mentally unstable people.

Here is how Obama described ISIS’s role in the Orlando terror attack (emphasis added):

So whatever the motivations of the killer, whatever influences led him down the path of violence and terror, whatever propaganda he was consuming from ISIL and Al Qaida, this was an act of terrorism, but it was also an act of hate. This was an attack on the LGBT community.

Notice how he skirts the killer’s self-described motivations: an allegiance to the Islamic State and a desire to kill on its behalf, which the killer made clear in a 911 call and another call to a news station during the attack. Instead, Obama describes the terrorist in almost victim-like terms, including passive-tense language, as if he were a vulnerable individual who was just walking around one day and became “radicalized” in the same way someone catches a cold.

Later in his speech, Obama blamed the attack on the terrorist’s ability to procure a gun. The president also blamed Republican lawmakers who refuse to pass Obama’s plan to eliminate due process protections provided by the Fifth Amendment. To Obama, the Second and Fifth Amendments–not violent, radical Islam or its practictioners–were the real perpetrators:

We can’t anticipate or catch every single deranged person that may wish to do harm to his neighbors or his friends or his coworkers or strangers. But we can do something about the amount of damage that they do. Unfortunately, our politics have conspired to make it as easy as possible for a terrorist or just a disturbed individual like those in Aurora and Newtown to buy extraordinarily powerful weapons, and they can do so legally.



[…]



The notion that the answer to this tragedy would be to make sure that more people in a nightclub are similarly armed to the killer defies common sense. Those who defend the easy accessibility of assault weapons should meet these families and explain why that makes sense.

When Obama did speak about the terrorist, Obama deliberately conflated him with the Newtown and Aurora shooters — neither of whom had any coherent ideology, connection to terror cells, or religious affiliations with Islam or any other religious belief system — while ignoring that the Orlando terrorist proactively declared his allegiance to ISIS and his desire to murder in the group’s name on behalf of the group’s stated goal of murdering infidels:

We can’t anticipate or catch every single deranged person that may wish to do harm to his neighbors or his friends or his coworkers or strangers. But we can do something about the amount of damage that they do. Unfortunately, our politics have conspired to make it as easy as possible for a terrorist or just a disturbed individual like those in Aurora and Newtown to buy extraordinarily powerful weapons, and they can do so legally.



[…]



Now, those who were killed and injured here were gunned down by a single killer with a powerful assault weapon. The motives of this killer may have been different than the mass shooters in Aurora or Newtown. But the instruments of death were so similar. And now another 49 innocent people are dead; another 53 are injured; some are still fighting for their lives; some will have wounds that will last a lifetime.

Obama is so eager to bury the killer’s allegiance to radical Islamism that he talks about the killer’s motivations as though they’re a mystery wrapped in an enigma, in spite of the fact that the terrorist repeatedly declared his motivations in clear English to anyone who would listen.

The president’s remarks in Orlando are only the latest instance of his deliberate refusal to say the words “radical Islam,” and that’s a problem. America needs a president who will accurately define the enemy, because you cannot defeat an enemy when you won’t even acknowledge its existence.

The Christian Schools Free-Speech Problem,"During the past few years, responding to ever-more draconian codes on secular campuses aimed at constraining free speech, dissenting voices have been raised here and there across the political spectrum, defending free expression and free association for all. This addition of conscientious objection outside conservative and religious ranks is a welcome development. It also brings us to one other large threat to free speech in education these days—one that’s still in the closet.

Secularist progressivism claims to champion diversity, but its activists today do not tolerate genuine diversity, including and es­pecially in the realm of ideas, as revealed by today’s legal and other attacks on Christian colleges, Christian associations and clubs, Christian schools, Christian students, and Christian homeschooling.

These are bellwether ideological campaigns that have yet to gar­ner the attention they deserve outside religious circles. Their logical conclusion is to interfere with and shut down Christian education itself—from elementary school on up to religious colleges and uni­versities.

It’s Not An Education If It Includes Christian Ideas?

Consider a few particulars. The Christian college club Intervarsity has had its credentials questioned on secular campuses around the country. So have other student groups including Chi Alpha and the Christian Legal Society, the focus of Christian Legal Society v. Martinez (2010), which found that Hastings College had not violated the First Amendment in forcing the CLS to accept members who violated its Christian moral code. During the past ten years, two high-profile Christian colleges—The King’s College in New York, and Gordon College in Massachusetts—have been subjected to accreditation battles. Meanwhile, home-schooling remains an object of attack by leftish pundits, New Atheists, the National Education Association, and other progressive standard-bearers.

Still other authorities want to discredit religious higher education altogether. Writing in the Chronicle of Higher Education in 2014, a professor at the Uni­versity of Pennsylvania called accreditation for any Christian col­lege a “scandal,” adding that “[p]roviding accreditation to colleges like [evangelical Protestant] Wheaton [College] makes a mockery of whatever academic and intellectual standards the process of ac­creditation is supposed to uphold.” Trinity Western University in Canada has likewise been embroiled for years in a battle to keep its accreditation—because its community members pledge not to have sex outside traditional marriage.

Let’s ask the obvious question: exactly whose schools are being at­tacked as unworthy, substandard, and undeserving of recognition? Christians’ schools, that’s whose—not progressive flagships like Bennington, Middlebury, or Sarah Lawrence. If religious tradi­tionalists were fanning out to campaign against schools dominated by other canons, cacophony would resound from Cupertino to Ban­gor. But because the prejudice propelling these attacks has Christi­anity in its sights, no one outside religious circles objects.

How about Some Turnabout?

Here again, empathy from secular and progressive people who do believe that other citizens should be free to choose the kind of colleges they want would be a vital addition to this conversation, just as they are to the conversation over free speech on secular quads. There is an elementary question of fairness here. Christian activists are not trying to shutter secular schools; but some progressive ac­tivists are trying to put Christian schools out of business. Can’t tol­erant people have a problem with that, whether they’re believers or not?

These efforts to impede religious education are also part of an ongoing paradox. It is not Christian colleges that have made a habit of ha­rassing and intimidating speakers who represent different points of view; it is nonreligious campuses. When socialist presidential candidate Bernie Sanders gave a speech in September 2015 at Liberty University, media accounts, including in The New York Times, took note of how courteous and polite the student body was, and how they unfailingly applauded a speaker who acknowledged at the outset profoundly disagreeing with their views.

Contrast their civility with the hostile reception certain other thinkers are guaranteed these days, just by setting foot on secular campuses. Followers of the Cross, especially, are often greeted by an especially bilious class of protester. Thus, for example, University of Tulsa students protested a former self-professed lesbian turned Christian—on the grounds that calling something “sinful” is “thinly veiled hate speech,” as one leader of the protest explained.

Simi­larly, when Jennifer Roback Morse—a former Ivy League professor and head of the Ruth Institute, a nonprofit dedicated to traditional Christian teaching—appeared at the University of California, Santa Barbara, 20 students interrupted her talk with chants, waving signs inscribed with various obscenities. When Christian speaker Ravi Zacharias spoke at the University of Pennsylvania, a local athe­ist group handed out bingo-style cards mocking the speaker to every student who entered the hall. The list could go on.

It also crosses borders. In 2013, Trinity College at Oxford hosted the legal group Chris­tian Concern for a three-day conference on “How to Engage the Secular Culture.” Again, vitriol ensued, with protesters charging the group was “intolerant.” Since Christian Concern’s supporters include former archbishop of Canterbury George Carey, among other leaders inside the Anglican Commu­nion and out, it’s hard to see attacks on the group as anything but an expression of anti-Christian prejudice.

This Is an Unfair Double Standard

H. L. Mencken memorably defined puritanism as “the haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy.” By similar logic, neo-puritanism appears to be the haunting fear that someone, somewhere may be a Christian exercising the right to free associa­tion with other Christians. To survey today’s attacks on religious education is to understand that traditionalists have reason to believe they are being singled out for ideological marksmanship as others are not.

It’s a double standard that offers one more opportunity for genuinely tolerant people to distance themselves from what is being com­mitted in progressivism’s name. People from anywhere on the spectrum who do not want to rid the world of Christian colleges, campus clubs, schools, and homeschooling might also now lend their ears and voices to this other speech problem. Some people on the Left do want these things—and the silence of their fellows gives breakaway inquisitors carte blanche to do what they’re doing.

Today’s renewed interest outside religious quarters in the fate of free speech on campus is one hopeful sign that this, too, might pass, and maybe even that religious education may yet find allies it didn’t know it had—at least if consistency and tolerance are allowed to rule. Anyway, it seems a worthwhile ask.

Prepare Your Kids For The Next Terrorist Attack,"Like most Americans, I have been overwhelmed with sadness in the wake of the Orlando terrorist attacks. I wept for the loss of 49 people, and prayed for their families and the wounded still fighting for their lives. I shuddered when I learned that the terrorist who took these lives also scouted Downtown Disney for his attack, where my youngest daughter was on vacation the week he launched it. As I read about the fear and confusion that overtook the victims that Saturday night, I wondered how my own loved ones would react in the face of terror, especially my teenage daughters. The youngest victim in Orlando, Akyra Murray, was just 18 years old.

Fifteen years after 9/11, Americans have been shielded in many respects from this kind of tragic loss of life at the hands of radical Islam. While ISIS has killed thousands of innocents on its crusade through the Middle East, most Americans have stayed safe in their homes, living without regard for dangers half a world away. We have been blessed with more than a decade of peace at home, living in a free society without fear. But with the Boston bombing in 2013, the San Bernardino shootings in December, and now the Orlando attack, Islamist violence has come to our homeland.

Make no mistake: our enemies are here to stay. As long as we have leaders who refuse to call our enemies by name and recognize the role radical Islam plays in not just inspiring, but dictating violence; media who seeks to shift the blame; and a society that is unwilling to support once again taking the fight to the enemy overseas, these attacks will continue. Their leaders call for attacks against anyone who does not adhere to their religious views. We are at war, and that war is here at home.

So as parents, what can we do to protect and prepare our children for a world that is inherently less safe than when they were born we had hoped and prayed it would be?

Learn to Be Sheepdogs

In the film “American Sniper,” the biopic on the life of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, there’s a scene where Kyle’s father teaches him about the different types of people in the world—that we are all sheep, wolves, or sheepdogs. The scene (which you should watch) is based on an excerpt from a book by retired Lt. Col. Dave Grossman (which you should read). The best quote to describe the essay is:

If you have no capacity for violence then you are a healthy productive citizen: a sheep. If you have a capacity for violence and no empathy for your fellow citizens, then you have defined an aggressive sociopath–a wolf. But what if you have a capacity for violence, and a deep love for your fellow citizens? Then you are a sheepdog, a warrior, someone who is walking the hero’s path. Someone who can walk into the heart of darkness, into the universal human phobia, and walk out unscathed.

I was raised in an area where gun ownership was commonplace, and my family has owned and operated firearms for as long as I can remember. I have held a concealed-carry permit in the past, and we have several rifles locked in a safe in our garage. My husband and I have spent years traveling in dangerous parts of the world where religious violence and heightened security are a part of daily life.

But while I would love to think I would know how to react if I faced an active shooter or even a home invader or an attacker on the street, I have to be honest about my preparedness before I can teach my kids what to do. The truth is, I don’t put nearly enough rounds down a range to be prepared to defend my family if the time came. While my husband and I have talked to my teens about how to fight a rapist, I’ve also never had a frank conversation with them about what to do if they are ever caught up in a terrorist attack.

Especially when my kids are daily in a gun-free zone (where even Howard Stern recognizes they will be less safe), it is my responsibility as a parent to make sure they know there is evil in the world, and be prepared to face it as best they can if, God forbid, the time ever comes.

If it does, I hope my family and I can react like Imran Yousuf, the former U.S. Marine and Pulse bouncer who remained calm in the face of gunfire and led dozens of people to safety during the attack. I hope they will learn from groups like the Pink Pistols, an LGBT self-defense organization that recognizes the “legal, safe, and responsible use of firearms for self-defense” is necessary to protect all communities from evil.

So don’t teach your children to be afraid. Teach them to be ready. Teach them to train. Teach them to serve. Teach them to identify evil, stare it straight in the face, and defend those weaker than themselves. Teach them to be sheepdogs.

Why It’s Idiotic To Blame Christians For The Orlando Attack,"The media constantly refuses to air critiques of both Islam and the LGBT lobby, and I was curious what the coverage would look like when the two cultures finally clashed. But I had expected we’d see a gay couple attempting to purchase a wedding cake from a Muslim baker or hire a Muslim wedding photographer, and wondered whether the courts and public opinion would rule the same way they had against Christians. Yet there are no words for the horror that occurred in Orlando. My heart aches for everyone who suffered loss that day.

I do want to look at a common response from some on the Left, however. Employees of the American Civil Liberties Union and others promptly blamed Christians for the shooting, which is idiotic.

So many terroristic enablers in churches, in Congress, and state houses. Whether by discriminatory policy or the love affair with guns.



— Mandela Barnes (@TheOtherMandela) June 12, 2016

It’s bigoted and ignorant enough to blame an entire demographic for the actions of one person from that demographic (“All Muslims are terrorists,” for example), but why on earth would you blame an entirely different demographic? When someone says, “I do this horrific thing in the name of Religion A,” it’s irrational to blame Religion B.

We Love Gay People, So We Won’t Lie to Them

The shooting happened at a gay bar, and Christians do believe that marriage is the permanent and exclusive unity of one man and one woman, for reasons that were obvious to most people until a few decades ago. Being a lot more stable than the whims of society, Christianity still teaches the same things about marriage.

Christians believe the laws of morality are as objective as the laws of physics: we didn’t make them, but we can learn them. Just as we can build better airplanes if we understand the laws of physics, we can build better societies if we understand the laws of morality. Sin is real, and Christianity’s founding moment was God, out of love, dealing with that.

But while Christians believe homosexual actions are wrong, Christianity has never and does not now teach that it’s okay to kill people just because they’re gay. When fringe groups calling themselves Christian do horrific things, Christians are nearly unanimous in denouncing them and pointing out how these actions aren’t Christian at all. (For example, watch LutheranSatire’s delightful mockery of the Westboro Baptist Church as the Westboro Baptist Chipmunks.) We believe that sin is real, but the context within which we believe that does not inspire violence.

For one thing, we believe we’re pretty much all in the same boat regarding sin. We’re all sinners, whether we spend our Saturday nights at gay bars or in church. Jesus made it clear that he came for sinners. (If you want to hear him being explicit, read Mark 2:17, where he says, “Those who are well do not need a physician, but the sick do. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repent.”)

Yes, Christians do believe homosexual actions are sinful. But we also believe that mass shootings are sinful, and lying is sinful, and gossip is sinful, and so are laziness, torture, theft, rape, dishonesty, abuse. As a Catholic, I go to confession about once a month to repent, seek mercy, and renew my own commitment to rid myself of sinful behavior. We all sin.

In the face of horrific sins like the shooting in Orlando, Christians often remind themselves, “But for the grace of God, there go I.” This is distinctly different both from the brand of Islam that the Orlando shooter proclaimed his allegiance to and from the secular attack mobs on Twitter insisting on lashing out at their political opponents rather than doing some soul-searching or seeking to comfort the stricken families during a time of grief.

Sin Is Not the End of the Road, But a Beginning

When Christians say “that action is sinful,” we don’t presume to judge a person’s culpability from a place of superiority. We didn’t make the rules. We break them ourselves, plenty. So we leave the judging and punishing to God. Our faith teaches that the reality of our sin doesn’t have to define us for eternity. It’s a faith of hope, of an opportunity for all our sins to be wiped clean for eternity. When the Jews of Jesus’s time were poised to stone a woman caught in adultery, he raised the bar for their moral understanding. “Let the one among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her,” he said. Then he told the woman, “From now on, do not sin anymore.”

He didn’t say it’s okay to betray your spouse, or that the woman didn’t sin. But he got everyone to examine their own consciences, drop their rocks, and leave. This is the man Christians follow. (For further illustration, see his Parable of the Unforgiving Servant.) We believe in sin, but we’re taught to respond not with hate but with love, as many Chick-Fil-A employees did in Orlando, following the example of Christ. This is a complex belief well-suited to the human condition that many on the secular Left seem unwilling to understand or grapple with seriously. They prefer instead to set up caricatures of Christianity and attack those.

While Christians believe in sin, we also believe in repentance and mercy. The great promise of Christianity is that, ultimately, our sins don’t have to condemn us to death. When St. John the Baptist was preparing the way for Jesus—the transcendent God becoming a human being who would suffer horrific violence to provide a way out of the world we’ve made horrific—he didn’t slaughter the people he judged to be sinful. He called them to repentance. That’s been the message of Christianity from the beginning: we’re all sinners, but there’s hope because of God’s exemplary love; we need to repent.

To say that Christianity’s teaching about marriage caused the shooting at a gay bar is to reveal either profound ignorance or profound disregard for accuracy, either of which ought to be profoundly embarrassing. It also reveals a profound hypocrisy among those who are willing to criticize one world religion reflexively while shielding another that has actual ties to the event in question.

When ISIS routinely throws gay people off buildings and publicly calls for terrorist attacks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and a shooter calls 911 during the attack to pledge allegiance to ISIS, and ISIS claims responsibility for the attack, you have limited options. You can be ignorant and bigoted, and blame all Muslims, or all Middle Easterners, or all people who have darkish skin and beards. You can be irrational and idiotic, and blame a different religion entirely. Or you can acknowledge the obvious fact that the gunman was inspired by the violent faction of Islam that is ISIS.

You pick.

Hamas Is ISIS’s Deadly New Best Friend,"Hamas has a new ally in the Middle East. The ISIS affiliate in the Sinai Peninsula, known as ISIS Sinai Province or simply Sinai Province, is helping Hamas smuggle arms and other supplies into the Gaza Strip from Egypt. This new relationship is one of the many unforeseen consequences of the Arab Spring and the growing instability in the Middle East, bringing a fresh threat to America’s Egyptian and Israeli allies. It’s also more evidence of Iran’s ambition to become a regional hegemon.

Hamas and Sinai Province are coordinating in a number of ways. Hamas is purchasing arms from the ISIS affiliate and giving the group military training (specifically on the use of antitank missiles). Hamas has also provided medical care for ISIS fighters in Gaza. Sinai Province occupies the territory where entrances to the smuggling tunnels to Gaza are located, thus making the ISIS affiliate a necessary strategic ally for Hamas. The two groups have also coordinated on attacks in the north of the Sinai Peninsula near the border with Israel, according to Egyptian officials. Hamas, of course, denies any such relationship.

There’s more to this story than just the convenience of right time, right place. Hamas and ISIS have found their way to one another in the wake of the Arab Spring and a rearranging of allies and allegiances. To understand how we’ve gotten here, we need to sift through the chain reaction sparked by the instability that followed the Arab Spring.

The Arab Spring Rearranged Hamas’ Allies

Prior to the Arab Spring, Hamas looked to Syria as one of its key allies, locating its external headquarters there and receiving aid in the form of funding and weapons. Iran, a Syrian ally, was also a major funder of the Sunni group. But when the Syrian uprising began in 2011, Hamas had to decide whether to side with the regime or the Sunni rebels who allied with Hamas’ own close allies, the Muslim Brotherhood. Ultimately, Hamas sided with the rebels, declaring its support for the Syrian people and removing its external headquarters to Qatar in 2012. This, in turn, damaged Hamas’ relationship with Iran, which was aiding Syrian President Bashar al Assad, and led to a falling-out between the two.

Meanwhile in Egypt, longtime authoritarian ruler Hosni Mubarak was ousted in a coup in 2011 following 18 days of protests. Mubarak had had a good working relationship with Hamas’ rival Palestinian political group Fatah, but was at odds with Hamas. Once Mubarak fell and the Muslim Brotherhood was elected in 2012, Hamas leaders hoped they would now have friends in high places. Hamas, after all, has its roots in the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood. Mohamed Morsi’s positioning as president could only benefit them, especially when it came to the blockades on their tunnels to Egypt. Or so they thought.

Although the Morsi government was certainly friendly to Hamas and made many overtures of support for them, it did little to materially help the group during its short time in power. In just more than a year, Morsi was ousted by a military coup and replaced by Fatah al-Sisi, who not only doubled down on the Mubarak-era repression of the Muslim Brotherhood, but has since aggressively worked to destroy Gaza’s smuggling tunnels into the Sinai Peninsula. This has left Hamas hard up for supplies and hurt Gaza’s fragile economy.

How ISIS in the Sinai Peninsula Grew Out of the Arab Spring

Another outcome of the Arab Spring was of course the rise of ISIS in Syria and Iraq, and its affiliated arm in the Sinai Peninsula. The Salafi jihadist group Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, based in the Sinai Peninsula, formed in 2011 in the wake of Mubarak’s fall and the subsequent release of extremists from prison. It pledged allegiance to ISIS in November 2014 and is now commonly known as Sinai Province.

Sinai Province has now grown to about 1,000 members, with many coming from Bedouin tribes and former al-Qaeda members. However, they’ve also seen Egyptian recruits who were crestfallen when the military coup ousted Morsi. Having lost their faith that the political process could lead to Islamist rule, they radicalized and joined the jihadist group.

The ISIS affiliate in Sinai has been prolific in its attacks on Egyptian police, military, and civilians. They’ve fired rockets into southern Israel and attacked an Egyptian naval vessel. But perhaps most notably, they claimed responsibility for bringing down an Egyptian airliner in 2015, killing 224 people. Meanwhile, Al-Sisi’s government has been aggressively fighting the group since the military coup in 2013.

Mubarak’s fall, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, and the coup that brought a hardline anti-Islamist to power all worked in concert with the instability in Iraq and civil war in Syria to create a perfect storm, putting Hamas and ISIS-Sinai Province in a position to help one another. In addition, the fall of Libya has allowed for more sophisticated weapons to flow into the region.

Hamas and ISIS Both Want to Destroy Israel

Officials say this is a relationship of convenience, pointing out that the two groups have little in common politically or ideologically. But this isn’t entirely true. One important thing they share is that both Hamas and Sinai Province see Israel as their enemy and will look for opportunities to attack it. Hamas’ position toward Israel is well known—their charter includes a call for destroying the Jewish state. But Sinai Province has its eyes on Israel as well.

According to the Jerusalem Post, the group is planning a big attack on southern Israel. A senior Salafist official in the Gaza Strip said Sinai Province is going to be a “pioneer” in confronting Israel, and that an attack is just a matter of time. The Israeli Defense Force confirmed they are expecting such an attack any day.

Although Sinai Province fighters had targeted Israel before pledging allegiance to ISIS, the directive to attack is now coming from ISIS headquarters as well. In recent weeks, ISIS has begun a propaganda push calling for recruits to come to the Sinai Peninsula and join the ISIS affiliate there with the promise of one day “liberating” Jerusalem and destroying Israel. They have put considerable resources into the coordinated release of 14 different videos meant to encourage people from Egypt and Sinai Peninsula to join the self-proclaimed caliphate’s branch in the region. This indicates the extent to which ISIS views this affiliate as strategically important.

The alliance between ISIS and Hamas is a dangerous combination of forces, to be sure. ISIS-Sinai Province will no doubt take advantage of Hamas’ years of experience attacking Israel, as well as their own experience before the fall of Morsi (when the Muslim Brotherhood was pushed out of power, the group switched its focus to the Egyptian state). But now that they have ISIS’ backing, more recruits coming in, and Hamas’ help, they will be better positioned once again to launch attacks into southern Israel. They will likewise surely utilize Hamas’ drone technology. Hamas has already used drones to surveil Egyptian security forces in the northern Sinai Peninsula to secure its smuggling pipeline via ISIS, as well as on the Israeli-Egyptian border.

Hamas’ cooperation with Sinai Province is also a way for Iran to support ISIS in the region. The Islamic Republic recommenced support for Hamas in 2015 and has since given millions of dollars to the group. Despite the sectarian differences between Shiite Iran and Sunni Hamas and ISIS, Iran is willing to help them both because of their joint interests in destroying Israel and destabilizing the Egyptian state. It is also another way for Iran to gain hegemony in the region and fight a proxy war against the United States.

This is just one example of the unforeseen effects of instability in the region, and it shows how domino effects can quickly pick up speed there. The consequences that military coups, revolutions, and civil wars bring, which quickly stretch out across borders and sectarian divides, are real. Despite the Obama administration’s fervent desire not to be embroiled in sectarian or regional conflicts in the Middle East, inaction and indecision are making things worse. Whoever is our next president, we should all hope that he or she understands this and is prepared to take action.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/06/23/hamas-is-isiss-deadly-new-best-friend/,2016-06-23
How Democrats Won The House Gun-Control Sit-In,"The Democrats’ House gun-control sit-in was a failure and was always destined to be a failure from the standpoint of actually moving any gun-control legislation. No bill, no break? Not really. Speaker Paul Ryan ended the current congressional session, and eventually everyone just filtered out.

But maybe it was a success after all, just at a different goal.

Partly it helped the Democrats invert the symbols and pageantry of the “liberal” mythology, as well as the very meaning of the civil rights movement, from “demanding freedom for yourself” to “taking freedom away from others.”

But that’s a long-term process of which this is just one small part. The sit-in also achieved a more concrete and immediate goal: We spent all last week talking about gun control, and its pros and cons, instead of talking about terrorism.

So the sit-in delivered something important for Democrats, after all.

The Justice Department initially tried to hide the Orlando shooter’s invocations of radical Islam by purging them from the transcripts of his call to police. In a textbook example of the Streisand Effect, this only brought more attention to the issue. But then the sit-in came to the rescue and diverted our attention again. It succeeded, at least for a little while, in getting us to take the Orlando shooting and re-file it in our minds under the heading of “mass shootings” and therefore under the wider file of “domestic gun-control debate.” And we have forgotten that the shooter, Omar Mateen, pledged loyalty to ISIS.

In fact, as time goes on, it becomes less clear that there ever was any other motive to muddy the issue. Several reports indicate the FBI investigation has failed to corroborate claims that Mateen committed the shooting because he was a self-loathing gay man. The two motives are not necessarily exclusive; martyrdom for Islam could have been his way of trying to cancel out his “sin.” But if the gay motive is evaporating, that leaves only radical Islam.

Yet we’ve already been diverted. Not only have we forgotten that the Orlando attack was Islamic terrorism, we’re not thinking about it enough to realize that this is precisely the form Islamic terrorism now takes. The Sydney Siege in 2014 was our warning, and the Paris attacks last year—both of them—along with Garland, San Bernardino, and others, confirms that these are the new ISIS rules for attacks on the West: many smaller attacks by ISIS-inspired loners with local citizenship, rather than one big attack by foreign plotters.

The thing that really makes this the perfect terrorist strategy is that our current leaders are dead-set on pretending it isn’t happening. They will always find some other excuse: an Internet video, provocative cartoons, “workplace violence,” or “homophobia.” Rather than fight back against the Islamists, they’ll respond by trying to take away our own freedoms.

You can see the incentive for this pretense. Acknowledging that the Orlando attack was about radical Islam and not just hatred of homosexuals would create pressure to think about more aggressive counter-terrorism measures and examine the failure of the FBI to realize Mateen was a threat despite more than one tip-off. And if this attack, like the others, was inspired by the successful example of ISIS, then the pressure should be on to actually do something to defeat ISIS—instead of our current policy, which is to act as if Syria is somebody else’s problem.

Ah, but politicians only want to see the problems that require their preordained solutions. For the current administration, that prepackaged agenda includes disarming the American people and cringing in apology for America once having asserted its interests somewhere in the world. So they try to get us to live inside their delusion and see “workplace violence” and “homophobia” where there is actually radical Islam.

That’s the delusion House Democrats acted out in last week’s sit-in, and their success was that they got so many people to agree to live with them in that alternative universe.

5 Big Takeaways From The House Benghazi Report,"A congressional committee responsible for investigating the 2012 terrorist attack that killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, has issued its final report.

Here are the five big takeaways from the U.S. House Select Committee on the Events Surrounding the 2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi, Libya, gleaned from a summary report by Reps. Jim Jordan, R-OH, and Mike Pompeo, R-KS.

1. Administration Misled Public Immediately and Continually

Even though U.S. officials — including Hillary Clinton — knew immediately that the siege in Benghazi was a highly coordinated terror attack, they chose to mislead the public with statements about spontaneous protests caused by a YouTube video.

The report indicates that political considerations were on the minds of State Department officials learning about the attack. Before the Benghazi attack even ended, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland sent an email to two other, high-level Clinton aides, Jacob Sullivan and Phillipe Reines, that noted top Obama aide Ben Rhodes was worried or upset about Mitt Romney’s comments on the attack. As Jordan and Pompeo put it:

And so on this highly charged political stage — just 56 days before the presidential election — events forced the administration to make a choice about what to tell the American people: Tell the truth that heavily armed terrorists had killed one American and possibly kidnapped a second — and increase the risk of losing the election. Say we do not know what happened. Or blame a video-inspired protest by tying Benghazi to what had occurred earlier in the day in Cairo. The administration chose the third, a statement with the least factual support but that would help the most politically.

Obama’s reelection campaign was a prominent consideration, but Hillary Clinton’s signature policy achievement was her push to invade Libya, so the political ramifications were serious for her as well. As her Deputy Chief of Staff and Director of Policy Jacob Sullivan characterized it in 2011, Clinton had “leadership/ownership/stewardship of this country’s Libya policy from start to finish.” Buddy Sidney Blumenthal, who had business interests in Libya, praised Clinton for following his advice on invading Libya and encouraged her to take full credit for the invasion.

The Benghazi committee shows that the administration told a public story designed to connect the attack to the video and protests in Cairo and a private story that acknowledged the reality that it was a terrorist attack. Clinton’s September 11 statement referred to a “response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet,” while internal documents about the al-Qaeda-like terror attack didn’t mention any video or protest.

Clinton’s public statement on September 12 again referred to “a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet,” while her private chat with the Egyptian prime minister clearly said, “We know that the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack – not a protest. … Based on the information we saw today, we believe the group that claimed responsibility for this was affiliated with al Qaeda.”

Each day it goes on like this: Clinton tells family members of those killed in Benghazi that the video was to blame, while privately admitting their deaths had nothing to do with a spontaneous protest of a video. Administration members’ public statements all talk about the video, while most private statements don’t.

One exception would be Ben Rhodes’ email that says, “Goals: To underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy.”

But the administration’s misleading talking points were clear, such as Ambassador Susan Rice’s indignant claim on CNN’s “State of the Union” that “[F]irst of all, let’s be clear about what transpired here. What happened this week in Cairo, in Benghazi, in many parts of the region … was a result – a direct result of a heinous and offensive video that was widely disseminated.”

None of these public statements were true. Also, despite claims to the contrary, they did not accurately reflect changing intelligence reports, House members say.

2. Weak Benghazi Security Points to Clinton’s Political Considerations

It had already been reported that the Benghazi security situation was dire. House Republicans note that one State Department diplomatic security agent “viewed the situation as a ‘suicide mission’ where ‘there was a very good chance that everyone was going to die.'”

According to the summary report, “Some blame the deplorable security conditions in Benghazi on the facility’s ‘made up’ State Department designation. To them, the fact the Department labeled the facility ‘temporary’ excused shortcomings in the compound’s physical security. A ‘temporary’ designation enabled the facility to skirt a host of written internal security requirements that applied to more permanent locations. We also learned it was an improvised designation not used at any of the State Department’s other 275 facilities around the world.”

In addition to Ambassador Chris Stevens’ pleas regarding security made before he was killed, Clinton received a memo about the danger of keeping Americans in Benghazi in August 2012. The memo was alarming, for something so bureaucratic. It used words such as “urgency,” “lawlessness,” “unpredictable,” “lack of effective security,” “limited success,” “widespread violence,” and “act with increasing impunity.” Clinton, who was in charge of American policy in Libya, chose not to remove Americans from Benghazi or beef up security.

Other countries and organizations fled, but the United States remained. The most plausible answer for why this was the case is troubling, House members say: “Secretary Clinton pushed for the U.S. to intervene in Libya, which at the time represented one of her signature achievements. To leave Benghazi would have been viewed as her failure and prompted unwelcome scrutiny of her choices.”

3. Military Never Sent Men or Machines to Help

Members of the committee say they are convinced — contrary to the administration’s public claim that the military did not have time to get to Benghazi — that the administration never even tried to get anyone to help in the fight. From the report:

Finally, we learned troubling new details about the government’s military response to the attack. Until now the administration has led us to believe the military did not have assets — men or machines — close enough or ready enough to arrive in Benghazi in time to save lives. As one earlier committee put it, ‘given their location and readiness status it was not possible to dispatch armed aircraft before survivors left Benghazi.’ The first asset to arrive in Libya — a Marine ‘FAST’ platoon — did not arrive until nearly 24 hours after the attack began. What is troubling is that the administration never set in motion a plan to go to Benghazi in the first place. It is one thing to try and fail; it is yet another not to try at all. In the end, the administration did not move heaven and earth to help our people in Benghazi, as Americans would expect. The contrast between the heroic actions taken in Benghazi and the inaction in Washington — highlights the failure.

4. Terrorists Weren’t Brought to Justice

The day after the attack, President Obama promised, “We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act. And make no mistake, justice will be done.”

White House Counsel W. Neil Eggleston told the committee, “[T]he Administration’s focus since the attacks has been … an unwavering commitment to bring to justice those responsible for harming Americans[.]”

In the four years since the attack, only one terrorist has been captured and brought to the United States to face criminal justice.

5. Administration Obstructed Investigation

Republicans on the committee reveal that the Obama administration did not cooperate with the investigation but “stonewalled at virtually every turn.” The committee did manage to uncover Secretary Clinton’s breathtaking use of a private email account and server, something no previous investigative or oversight committee had known. But “the White House in particular left large holes in the investigation by denying the Committee access to documents and witnesses.” The Obama administration wouldn’t let the committee speak with anyone who was in the White House Situation Room on the night of the attacks or see the email communication between White House staffers.

Democrats Respond

House Democrats released a minority report yesterday to tamp down the anticipated effect of the majority report. The 339-page report aimed to debunk the conclusions of the majority report with a pre-emptive release, but House Republicans said the report was padded with bizarre non-sequiturs, such as 23 mentions of Donald Trump, a man with no role in the Benghazi attack. The report mentioned two of the victims of the attack less than Trump.

The minority report also accidentally confirmed the huge amount of money Clinton’s aide-de-camp Sidney Blumenthal is receiving from Clinton allies. President Obama forbade Clinton from hiring Blumenthal, but he acted as an informal advisor who recommended her Libya strategy, according to the emails Clinton has allowed the oversight committee to view.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/06/28/5-big-takeaways-from-the-house-benghazi-report/,2016-06-28
U.S. Negligence Is Feeding ISIS’ Global Appeal,"It seems every couple of days we hear about another ISIS-linked terrorist attack. The global appeal of the radical Islamist group is on the ascendant as it is continually able to inspire young Muslim men to wreak havoc in its name, from Orlando to Istanbul. Rather than a sign of the success of the U.S.-led assault on ISIS’ territorial claims, the growing frequency of terrorist attacks are, in part, a product of our own negligence.

Last Tuesday, three gunmen wearing suicide vests attacked the international terminal at Turkey’s Atatürk airport in Istanbul, killing 45 and injuring more than 200. Although ISIS hasn’t yet claimed responsibility, Turkish officials told the United States the organizer of the attack was a former commander of an Islamic State battalion in Syria.

On Sunday, Iraq suffered its deadliest attack since 2003, when ISIS attacked a busy neighborhood of Baghdad with a truck bomb that caused a massive fire, killing more than 215 people. On Friday, five gunmen killed 22 hostages in an attack on a café in an affluent neighborhood in Dhaka, Bangladesh, for which ISIS claimed responsibility.

On Monday, three separate suicide bombings were carried out in different parts of Saudi Arabia—one near the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina, where hundreds were gathered to break the Ramadan fast, another in a Shiite mosque in the eastern city of Qatif, and yet another near a U.S. diplomatic site in Jeddah. Four people were killed in these attacks.

Failure Isn’t Success

Many have claimed that the surge of ISIS-led or -inspired terrorist attacks are the desperate moves of an organization back on its heels as a result of the U.S.-led coalition’s fight against the self-proclaimed caliphate in Syria and Iraq. The surge in attacks, this argument goes, proves that the coalition’s efforts are working. But this is a perverted sort of logic: the proof that the fight against ISIS is working is supposedly the rise in terrorist attacks. In no other circumstance would we argue that failure equals success.

However, others, like the Brookings Institution’s Bruce Riedel, argue ISIS would be pursuing this strategy abroad even if the caliphate were thriving. After all, its goal is to fight the infidel, whether non-Muslims or apostates. This erodes the narrative that the coalition is weakening ISIS. Yes, ISIS lost control of Fallujah, and is suffering financially. But we shouldn’t underestimate its ability to adapt its mission and methods.

ISIS’ goal is to oppose the West and all those it sees as apostates, whether that means in the form of a territorial caliphate that adopts the harshest Sunni interpretation of sharia law and rejects all things Western, or by hitting Western and apostate targets in the West, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Both strategies advance the objective.

The rise in attacks, moreover, is further evidence that the global appeal of ISIS-inspired jihad is not dwindling. This is due, in part, to U.S. negligence, not just militarily, but rhetorically and diplomatically.

Censoring Reality Isn’t Going to Address It

We are all, by now, familiar with the Obama administration’s stubborn repudiation of identifying Islam when discussing terrorist attacks at home and abroad. Far beyond public statements, this philosophy has spread throughout our law enforcement and counter-terrorism efforts. All references to Islam, jihad, sharia, etc., were “purged” from training materials at the FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) at the behest of the group Muslim Advocates.

This is consistent with the Obama administration seeking advice from groups with Islamist ties, like the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). CAIR was found to be associated with Hamas, the terrorist group with roots in the Muslim Brotherhood, in the Holy Land Foundation trial in 2008. By looking primarily to Islamists for cues on how to address Islamic terrorism and engage the Muslim community, the administration is crippling its own ability to view the threat with clarity.

The White House’s diplomatic gestures further indicate the administration’s dereliction of duty in the fight against Islamic extremism. Take President Obama’s absence from the Paris unity march after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January 2015. Dozens of world leaders were present, including British Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But our president didn’t think it was worth his time and attention. Neither did Vice President Joe Biden or Secretary of State John Kerry.

In fact, the U.S. ambassador to France, Jane Hartley, was the only U.S. official present. In an embarrassing attempt at damage control, Kerry appeared in Paris a few days later with James Taylor to sing “You’ve Got a Friend.”

After the Paris nightclub attacks in November, Kerry vaguely described ISIS’ motives, arguing that while the Charlie Hebdo attacks “perhaps” had a “legitimacy” or “rationale that you could attach yourself to,” indicating that murder is an appropriate reaction to insulting Mohammed, the November attacks were “absolutely indiscriminate,” demonstrating for the hundredth time how little the administration seems to understand this very serious threat, not just to our national security but also to global stability.

Weakness Invites Aggression

Muslim extremists around the world see that the American government and much of American society do not take this threat seriously, and can’t or won’t admit its theological origins. Rather than feeling on the run, ISIS and the men it inspires to jihad must feel emboldened by this. Imagine the sense of being untouchable because the most powerful country in the world is practically giving your actions a pass—or acting as though they were random.

The United States not only won’t pursue a genuine fight against ISIS’ ideology, but the Obama administration is even lending an ear to Islamists at home. By censoring counter-terrorism training materials, our leaders are making it easier and easier for would-be terrorists to be radicalized at home and plan jihadist attacks under the radar of the FBI and DHS.

The Left continually insists, as Muslim Advocates President Farhana Khera did at last week’s Senate hearing, that by talking about Islam in any capacity when discussing terrorism, we are playing into ISIS’ hands. The argument is that groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda want nothing more than for the West and moderate Muslims to attack Islam. To what end isn’t clear.

Al-Qaeda may be frustrated it can’t get the West to believe its motives—last week it released a special edition of their magazine, Inspire, in which it called on jihadists to “avoid targeting places and crowds where minorities are generally found” so their religious motives will be believed. But this isn’t because al-Qaeda wants to instigate animosity between Muslims and the West. It’s doing that by inspiring jihad. It simply wants the West to believe al-Qaeda is fighting a holy war.

Groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS, and all those who would be called on to perpetrate attacks, are taking advantage of America’s varied neglect in the fight against radical Islam. And it’s taking its toll around the globe.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/07/07/u-s-negligence-is-feeding-isis-global-appeal/,2016-07-07
"Obama, Dems Exploit Dallas Attack To Push For Gun Control","It didn’t take long for the political blame game to begin after the Dallas shootings Thursday night. As in Orlando, so in Dallas. But this has become an established pattern in American politics.

Three days after the Orlando nightclub massacre last month, the New York Times ran an editorial blaming the attack on a political environment created by the GOP’s “corrosive politics” and anti-gay bigotry:

While the precise motivation for the rampage remains unclear, it is evident that Mr. Mateen was driven by hatred toward gays and lesbians. Hate crimes don’t happen in a vacuum. They occur where bigotry is allowed to fester, where minorities are vilified and where people are scapegoated for political gain. Tragically, this is the state of American politics, driven too often by Republican politicians who see prejudice as something to exploit, not extinguish.

Today, less than 24 hours after a gunman ambushed and killed five Dallas police officers and wounded more than a half-dozen more, the Congressional Black Caucus convened a press conference to condemn Republicans for not supporting stricter gun control legislation. “Republicans, what on Earth—why are you recoiling and not giving us a debate on gun violence?” said Rep. G.K. Butterfield. “Why not give it a hearing? Give us a debate. Give us an up or down vote on legislation on gun violence.”

Hours later, President Obama gave a statement commending the Dallas police and law enforcement officials everywhere. But he couldn’t resist adding a comment about gun control:

We also know that when people are armed with powerful weapons, unfortunately it makes attacks like these more deadly and more tragic. And in the days ahead, we’re going to have to consider those realities as well.

As Rahm Emanuel, Obama’s former chief of staff, so infamously stated, “You never want a serious crisis to go to waste. And what I mean by that [is] it’s an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before.”

Rest assured, we will hear very little if any discussion in the days ahead about the gunman’s motives, just like in the aftermath the Orlando attacks—even though the shooters in both cases clearly stated their motives. Omar Mateen was a radical Islamist who told a 911 operator he was killing in the name of ISIS. The Dallas gunman was apparently a black militant who told police he was angry about recent police shootings and that he wanted to kill white people, “especially white officers.”

After Orlando, the narrative that emerged was about Republicans’ hatred of gay people, not about terrorism.

The narrative moving forward in the wake of Dallas, at least among our political and media elites, will be about gun control, about the further concentration of power in Washington, D.C., and about Republican intransigence in the face of a tragedy that could have been prevented if only conservatives would at last repudiate and let go of their precious Second Amendment.

For the Left, in other words, this tragedy will be leveraged to accumulate political power. The crisis will be used as an excuse to do things they’ve always wanted to do. In crafting its narrative, the Left will do almost nothing to grapple with the social ills that contributed to Dallas or point a way forward for a deeply divided nation. Focusing on the means used to carry out the attack serves a useful partisan purpose. Focusing on the motivations for it, or the ideological pattern with which it fits, does not.

Could The Terror Attack In Nice Push France Into A Civil War?,"On Thursday evening, France was once again the target of a terrorist attack. A commercial truck ploughed into revelers gathered in Nice to celebrate France’s national holiday, Bastille Day, while the driver, and possibly other accomplices, shot into the crowd as they drove. Details are still emerging, but as of this writing 77 people are feared dead and hundreds more are injured. French police fired on the truck, killing the driver.

Images of the attack posted to social media Thursday night showed bodies strewn in the streets, scores of people running for safety along the waterfront, and the attackers’ truck riddled with bullet holes.

As France absorbs the shock of another mass-casualty attack, something dangerous is stirring in the heart of the republic. France’s chief of intelligence, Patrick Calvar, warned members of a French parliamentary commission earlier this week that if another terror attack were to happen in France, or something akin to the New Year’s Eve mass sexual assaults in Germany, it could spark a “civil war.” Calvar expressed concern about a populist backlash that would lead to a “confrontation” between ultra-right groups, such as Bloc Identitaire, and the rest of the country—especially Arab and North African immigrants.

With the revelation this week, due to a botched cover-up, that far more women were sexually assaulted in Germany on New Year’s Eve than was previously known, and the latest tragic terrorist attack in Nice, the possibility of major destabilization in the country seems all the more likely.

But a revolt in France wouldn’t just be a reaction to outside events. It would also come from deep within France’s unique culture and history. Indeed, France is likely to be the first European country to experience societal upheaval and a radical reordering as a result of immigration. There are signs such an upheaval is already underway.

The Rise of the Worldwide National Front

In the wake of high-profile terrorist attacks over the past year and a half, coupled with the ongoing migrant crisis, French voters are looking to the National Front for relief. The far-right nationalist party led by Marine Le Pen, who speaks openly about the dangers of terrorism, has called for leaving the European Union and the Euro.

The party’s rhetoric is unabashedly nationalistic, although it doesn’t approach the radicalism of the ultra-right. In recent polling, 28 percent of French voters said they would vote for Le Pen, twice as many as for current Socialist President François Hollande. Nicolas Sarkozy, former president and expected Republican candidate, comes in at 21 percent, making it likely Le Pen could reach the second round of voting in next year’s elections.

The rise of the National Front is part of a trend of rising populism and nationalism across the West. In Britain, the decision to leave the European Union has been called protectionist and racist against migrants. Germany has already seen roving bands of far-right vigilantes and attacks on migrant centers. Austria is re-doing its presidential election after the far-right candidate lost by only a couple thousand votes amid accusations of voter fraud. In the United States, the Trump movement has heavy overtones of American nationalism, with his supporters calling for an end to free trade and a drastic reduction of immigration.

Some of this is the natural backlash against the efforts of Western ruling elites to make everyone citizens of the world. Although certainly some Brexiteers voted “leave” solely based on quasi-racist views on immigration, it also had a lot to do with taking back their national sovereignty. They want Britain, not Brussels, to decide how many migrants they will take in or what kind of trade deals they will adopt. The migrant crisis was just the issue that brought things to a head.

France Has a Singularly Strong National Identity

France is experiencing a similar reaction. However, its swing toward nationalism is unique because of its history—and therefore more likely to succeed. If the migrant crisis were the tipping point for Brexit, it would be the raison d’être for a French “civil war.” If France decides to elect Le Pen and leave the EU, causing a major rift in the country, it would be due, in part, to France’s sense of national identity. That identity is more closely linked with France’s language, heritage, and culture than in most other Western countries. A revolt would come from deep within the country’s belly.

Ever since the French Revolution, the country has supposedly been based on the idea that all peoples can approach the apparatus of the state equally, regardless of nationality or ethnicity. This was supposed to solve the blood-and-soil nationalism that plagued the continent. In practice, however, it hasn’t worked. The supremacy of the French language makes this clear. Beginning in the first years after the revolution, the state aggressively purged French dialects, declaring they were languages of treason. This was followed by a language standardization effort unparalleled in history.

Today, France has strict protectionist laws about language and culture. All advertisements and public announcements must be in French, as must all official communications in the workplace, even from subsidiaries of foreign companies. The labels on all products must include French, and schools where French isn’t the primary language of instruction are ineligible for government funding. France also strictly regulates the percentage of broadcast television content that can be non-French.

As with language, so too with ethnicity. France has only begrudgingly accepted its North African population, which began to immigrate after World War II for temporary job opportunities. It was assumed these immigrants would leave after a few years. When this didn’t happen, and North African workers began bringing their families over, France struggled to make peace with the idea of their former colonial subjects becoming French citizens.

A Commitment to Unity Under Attack

A question often posed in discussions of French culture is “Qu’est-ce qu’un français?” (What is a French person). The answer for many in France—even if it’s often denied by the liberal elites—is someone who speaks French, whose heritage is Anglo-Saxon, and whose religion (even if just nominally) is Catholic. One can see this expressed in Le Pen’s surge in popularity. While America is often thought of as a country of immigrants, the French state is equivalent to French patrimony.

There’s only so much they’ll let their culture be watered down, whether from North African immigrants or the American cheeseburger—and there’s only so long they’ll allow themselves to be governed by non-French entities like the EU. French nationalists in particular certainly won’t put up with the migrant crisis much longer if it continues to be linked to terrorism and sexual assaults.

All European countries have this kind of nationalism in them. But France’s unique history of trying to force conformity makes it likely that a populist uprising will happen there first. It makes a populist revolt more possible and the chances of rancorous division in the country more immediate.

Is there going to be a civil war? Probably not. But after the horrifying scene in Nice, France could lurch so far to the right that it tears at the fabric of the country, triggers mass riots, and leads to a messy exit from the EU. If that happens, other European countries will not be far behind.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/07/15/could-the-terror-attack-in-nice-push-france-into-a-civil-war/,2016-07-15
Former Navy SEAL: Hillary Clinton Killed My Friends In Benghazi,"A former Navy SEAL blames Hillary Clinton for the death of four Americans who were killed during a terrorist attack on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.

“I want her held accountable for what she did,” Tej Gill said in an interview with The Blaze’s Dana Loesch. “I’m sure she’ll never go to jail, but at least place the blame securely on her shoulders.”

Gill was close friends with Tyrone Woods and Glenn Doherty — two former Navy SEALs who were killed in the attack in Benghazi on September 11, 2012. Woods and Doherty were in Libya working as security contractors, and they died rushing to aid their colleagues.

“If that consulate would’ve had the security in place that was needed and denied, that attack would’ve taken place, but the consulate would’ve been able to repel the attack,” he said.

“Six hundred security requests denied,” Gill continued, referring to Clinton’s decision to ignore multiple requests for additional security. “The consulate had zero security. There was some Libyan militia [working as a security force], they weren’t trained by the U.S., they weren’t vetted by the U.S., and they didn’t have U.S. supervisors. . . When the attack happened, they put their weapons down and walked away.”

Due to the lack of security, the consulate was overrun by terrorists in a matter of minutes, he said.

Prior to the attack, then-secretary of State Hillary Clinton was told numerous times the consulate was unsafe. American ambassador Chris Stevens pled for more security from Clinton multiple times before he was killed in the attack. She ignored the warnings and put American lives at risk.

Gill founded an organization called “Project Warpath,” which sells T-shirts that read “Hillary Clinton Killed My Friends,” to raise money for the Navy SEAL Museum in Fort Pierce, Florida. The museum helps wounded SEALs and SEAL families in need.

How To Decide Whether To Launch Our Military,"On October 23, 1983 a homicide truck bomber killed 243 Marines in Beirut, Lebanon, with a second blast killing 58 French soldiers immediately thereafter. Two days later, U.S. forces invaded the Caribbean island nation of Grenada. These two mostly forgotten military interventions during President Reagan’s first term offer lessons about applying U.S. military force today.

When I worked in the Pentagon for Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger during the Reagan administration, it was widely understood that the diplomats across the Potomac at the State Department were all too eager to call on the military to back up their diplomatic initiatives. The armed forces and their civilian leadership, only a decade removed from the fall of Saigon and the sting of the Vietnam War, were reluctant partners.

A year after the Beirut barracks bombing, Weinberger, an early opponent of the intervention in Lebanon, delivered what became known as the Weinberger Doctrine speech, outlining how to avoid overseas quagmires. These lessons are: only commit force to further U.S. or allied vital national interests; go in to win and with clear political and military objectives achievable with the force assigned; constantly reassess the resources needed to achieve those objectives; don’t commit force without a “reasonable assurance” of public and congressional support; and only commit U.S. troops as a last resort.

How This Criteria Could Have Forestalled Disaster

Weinberger’s advice, had it been taken, would have resulted in the United States avoiding its disastrous foray into Lebanon and the decades of unintended consequences since. In June 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon, a nation wracked with internal strife made worse by Jordan’s bloody expulsion of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s (PLO) leadership and guerilla forces some 11 years earlier. As Israeli forces advanced north, PLO chieftain Yasser Arafat was cornered in Beirut.

In August 1982, French, Italian, and U.S. forces arrived in Beirut under a United Nations (UN) peacekeeping agreement to assist in evacuating PLO forces to Tunisia. With the PLO safely out, President Reagan ordered the 800 U.S. Marines to leave Beirut, but, four days later, Lebanon’s president was assassinated and two days after that a Lebanese Christian militia associated with the assassinated president retaliated by killing between 762 and 3,500 mostly Palestinian and Lebanese Shiite civilians while the Israeli army then occupying the southern portion of Lebanon watched.

The renewed bloodshed and instability in Lebanon deepened the U.S. commitment there. But, six months later, the U.S. Embassy in Beirut was hit by bomb hidden in a delivery van, killing 63, including 17 Americans. A group called Islamic Jihad took credit for the attack, saying in a call to the local press that the attack was “part of the Iranian revolution’s campaign against imperialist targets throughout the world. We shall keep striking at any crusader presence in Lebanon, including the international forces.”

It was later determined that the Lebanese Shiite militia group Hezbollah carried out the attack on the embassy with senior Iranian officials providing direction and financing.

With the situation in Lebanon deteriorating, the Syrians and Iranians backed Hezbollah while the U.S. peacekeeping contingent provided equipment and training to the Lebanese army—a force now largely seen as a stand-in for the Lebanese Christian militia. Thus, the Marines in Lebanon lost any semblance of neutrality they may have had under the initial UN peacekeeping mission to rescue the PLO from the Israelis a year earlier.

The Marines, now under frequent Muslim sniper fire and mortar attacks, were authorized to call in air strikes and shore bombardment to protect themselves and support the Lebanese army.

Diplomatic Rules for Military Situations

But, operating under rules of engagement geared to a peacekeeping mission, the Marines were not allowed to chamber a round in their rifles “unless instructed to do so by a commissioned officer unless you must act in immediate self-defense.” More deadly crew-served weapons were to remain unloaded. As a result, when the truck bomb, later determined to have been driven by an Iranian national, careened onto the Marines’ cantonment area, the Marines couldn’t react quickly enough to defend themselves—they were disarmed by rules of engagement likely dictated by diplomatic rather than military considerations.

The French struck back against the bombing of their barracks with an airstrike on suspected Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) positions. President Reagan’s advisors considered a joint assault on Iran’s eastern Lebanon headquarters in Baalbek, Lebanon, with the French. But Weinberger, having been proved right about the ill-fated intervention into Lebanon, prevailed against the mission, arguing, among other points, it was not yet certain who perpetrated the attack on the Marine barracks. The mission was scrapped.

On February 7, 1984, a little more than three months later and with wavering congressional support, President Reagan ordered the U.S. Marines to start pulling out of Lebanon. The next day, the U.S.S. New Jersey provided covering fire, lofting 288 one-ton 16-inch rounds at enemy positions east of Beirut.

Neither Iran nor their Hezbollah proxies immediately got what they wanted—free reign in all of Lebanon—as the United States sent military aid to Israel to support its ongoing occupation of much of southern Lebanon, an effort that was pared to a security strip comprising about 10 percent of the nation in 1985 that was maintained through 2000.

Some critics have argued the failure of the United States to more vigorously respond to the Beirut Marine barracks bombing led to more terror attacks on U.S. targets. But this criticism ignores Weinberger’s initial opposition to the Lebanon deployment, a mission without a clear objective that placed Marines in harm’s way. Further, such criticism fails to take into account that Islamic terror isn’t monolithic in intent, with Iranian-backed terror a tool of statecraft versus terrorist attacks from Sunni Salafists, also known as Islamists, which has been less tied to formal nation-state policies.

A Clear Contrast in Grenada

The Grenada invasion was the antithesis of the year-and-a-half-long Lebanon intervention. Operation Urgent Fury was triggered by the arrest and murder of Grenada’s Marxist revolutionary coup leader. Grenada, a Caribbean island nation, offered the Soviet Union and its allies an important beachhead as the sole English-speaking communist-controlled outpost in the Western Hemisphere. Further, with the anarchy and violence signaling a power struggle between Marxist factions, Reagan’s national security team feared an Iranian hostage-like situation with 800 American medical students enrolled at the St. George’s School of Medicine.

On October 25, 1983, only two days after the Marine barracks bombing, a joint force of U.S. Army Rangers, paratroopers, Delta Force, U.S. Marines, and Navy SEALs invaded the island along with forces from Jamaica and other Caribbean nations. The Marxist military government was overthrown and elections were held in December of the following year. U.S. forces on the island were not targeted for attack by the locals after the initial assault.

Importantly, the Grenada operation served as a powerful show of force to U.S. adversaries in the region. Surinam, a South American nation which had drifted into the communist orbit, ejected the Cuban ambassador. Communist Nicaragua, a client state of the Soviet Union, was convinced that the Grenada operation was a dry run for an invasion there. Cuba even curtailed its regional subversive activities.

The contrast between the quickly executed Grenada operation, with its specific and achievable objectives tightly linked to clear national security concerns, and the deployment to Lebanon with its frequently shifting rationale, could not be clearer.

Another Successful Military Engagement

A little less than five years later, the United States did manage to apply force to the Islamic Republic of Iran in a way that played to American strengths while emphasizing Iranian weaknesses. On April 18, 1988, the U.S. Navy executed Operation Praying Mantis in the Persian Gulf. It was the largest U.S. naval engagement since World War II.

The operation was in retaliation for Iran mining a U.S. guided missile frigate four days before. That ship had been escorting former Kuwaiti oil tankers which had been reflagged as U.S. vessels, and the captains and at least half the crew were American. After Navy divers confirmed the mines were Iranian in origin, the punitive operation was approved.

The short, violent action decisively showed the Iranian theocrats the United States was still a power to be taken seriously.

Over the course of a few hours, ten U.S. Navy ships sank an Iranian frigate and missile boat, killing 56 crew, while also sinking three armed speedboats, damaging a frigate, and destroying two militarized offshore oil platforms. On the U.S. side, a sole Cobra helicopter was lost at night with its two crew. The aircraft was later raised with no signs of battle damage to indicate that it had been shot down.

The short, violent action decisively showed the Iranian theocrats the United States was still a power to be taken seriously. Operation Praying Mantis may also be responsible for the fact that, despite numerous threats to close the Straits of Hormuz to oil traffic over the years, Iran has never tried to do so—perhaps understanding the U.S. Navy could easily brush aside such an attempted blockade.

In more recent times, the military action to oust Afghanistan’s al-Qaeda-supporting Taliban regime in 2001 had its analog in the Grenada operation. The nation-building attempt that followed closely after drifted from the script. Grenada, a commonwealth island with 325 years of first French, then British rule, had some experience with rule of law and self-governance before the U.S. invasion. Afghanistan, a fractious land of some 13 ethnic groupings, was more or less an accidental nation—an ungovernable neutral zone between two wary empires: The Russian and the British.

The 2003 Iraq invasion, although far larger than either Grenada or Lebanon, had much more in common with the 1982-84 Lebanon mission from the start, with ambiguous objectives and an uncertain and open-ended endgame.

Because American soldiers, sailors, Marines, and airmen carry out America’s military operations, sustaining U.S. public support is paramount in seeing conflicts through to a victorious conclusion. Weinberger clearly outlined a commonsense guideline for committing U.S. forces in 1984. Future administrations would do well to revisit and embrace his sage advice.

Angela Merkel’s Migrant Crisis Hits Home With Terrorism,"In the last year and a half, Europe has been rocked by several terrorist attacks organized or inspired by the Islamic State. The attacks have focused on France and Belgium and left Germany untouched. Until now.

Germany has seen four violent attacks in the past week, three of which were perpetrated by refugees from the Middle East. This marks a new chapter in the violence occurring across Europe, as Germany becomes the latest target of the ISIS-inspired terrorist attacks plaguing the West.

It began last Monday when a 17-year-old refugee from Afghanistan, Riaz Khan Ahmadzai, attacked passengers with an axe and a knife on a train heading toward Würzburg. There were no casualties, other than the attacker himself, whom police shot. Four people were critically injured. Police found a hand-drawn Islamic State flag in the attacker’s room, and ISIS has claimed responsibility for the incident. This attack has caused German officials to assert that more attacks on trains may happen “at any time.”

On Friday, Ali David Sonboly killed nine people and wounded dozens more when he opened fire at a McDonald’s in a mall in Munich before taking his own life. Sonboly, a dual citizen of Germany and Iran, had done extensive research on mass shootings. As of Monday, officials insist there are no ties to Islamic terrorism or ISIS. This may prove true, but the German police have lost some of their credibility after their attempts to cover up the New Year’s Eve mass sexual assaults perpetrated by Middle Eastern and North African men.

Notably, Sonboly’s Afghan friend seems to have known of the attack in advance and failed to alert officials. He’s now being held as a suspect in the case. Not all crimes Muslims commit are necessarily acts of terrorism, but given the pattern of late in Europe and the United States, it shouldn’t be dismissed out of hand, as media and police have been so anxious to do.

Finally, on Sunday a Syrian refugee, Mohammed Daleel, set off a suicide bomb outside of a concert venue in Ansbach after being denied admission. He was the only person killed, but 15 others were injured. He left a video pledging his allegiance to ISIS. Daleel had received asylum in Bulgaria and came to Germany in 2015, but was denied asylum in 2015.

On the same day, another Syrian refugee attacked and killed a pregnant woman with a machete and wounded several others. There are currently no indications it was an act of terror, with police calling it a “crime of passion,” but little else is known.

These attacks all differ in strategy and tactics. The Ansbach bomber may have had some training or help, while the Würzburg train attacker could’ve done what he did with no support. But they indicate Germany is becoming the new focus of ISIS-inspired attacks, and that Germany’s refugee policy is in part to blame.

When Nobody Wants to Say ‘I Told You So’

Germany accepted more than 1 million refugees in 2015, after German Chancellor Angela Merkel gave an open invitation to Syrians to seek asylum there. Many were concerned at the time that this would seriously threaten European security, and that hostile actors would come in with the massive wave of migrants. Those who expressed these concerns were accused of bigotry and racism. But now their reservations seem prescient and justified.

German officials claim they’ve thwarted many terrorist plots in recent months, including a plot to attack a busy pedestrian area of Düsseldorf in June. But will they be able to overcome the difficulties of stopping attacks by individuals who are inspired by ISIS rather than directly linked with them? With the sheer number of migrants from countries where violent Islamic ideology is preached and practiced, it seems an impossible task.

German officials’ reactions to crises like these also raise concerns that the country may not be equipped to deal with the rising threat. It took Merkel 24 hours to respond to the Munich shootings, causing many to chastise her for avoiding responsibility for the attacks. People are using the hashtag #Merkelsommer, or “Merkel summer,” indicating the extent to which the public blames her.

Meanwhile, Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said violence “wasn’t typical for refugees in our country,” perhaps implying the German government is in denial about the threats to its national security.

Take Citizens’ Concerns Seriously

Merkel was wrong to dismiss the concerns of her people and of European Union member states. She didn’t take the public’s anxieties seriously. Not only did this heighten security risks, but it erodes people’s confidence in the German government and in the E.U., the latter of which dictates immigration quotas for member states. This was part of the motivation for last month’s vote among Britons to exit the E.U.

As this confidence wanes, far-right populist parties are gaining traction. Earlier this year, Merkel’s ruling party lost badly in local elections to the Alternative for Germany party, which takes a firm anti-immigrant stance and has been very critical of Merkel. France’s far-right National Front candidate, Marine Le Pen, has recently soared in polls, with twice as many voters saying they’d vote for her as for sitting Socialist President François Hollande.

Another worry is that far-right groups will begin wreaking havoc themselves as a reaction to Islamic terrorism refugees have committed. France’s chief of intelligence recently warned of this danger, saying that a “civil war” could arise if the country continues to see terrorist attacks, or if mass sexual assaults occur there.

So, what can Germany do? They already began tightening their asylum policies earlier this year and its parliament passed a new law stating that benefits and residency permits may be restricted for those who refuse to take German language and integration classes. The number of refugees has fallen this year, indicating this may be stemming the tide.

But what about the migrants who are already there, and who mean to do harm? This is the question all of Europe faces in this new age of global jihad. Germany’s interior minister Herrmann told the public to expect more attacks, echoing the French prime minister, who said France must “learn to live with the threat” of Islamic terrorism.

But it’s doubtful this will satisfy the people of Europe. As tensions rise and the attacks continue, the road seems to lead inevitably toward every country for itself, nationalism, and the breakdown of the European Union.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/07/26/angela-merkels-migrant-crisis-hits-home-with-terrorism/,2016-07-26
Why Sansa Stark Can’t Trust Jon Snow,"HBO’s “Game of Thrones” has been nominated for several Emmys this year, including outstanding drama series. Many have said this season is the best yet, and I have to agree. The spectacle of it all, the character development, the unfolding of the plot, the various themes from religious intrigue to political alliances have captivated audiences from beginning to end. One theme I found particularly interesting, as did many others on social media, was the issue of trust involving the character Sansa Stark.

For those of you who don’t know—and you don’t need to in order to glean something meaningful from this post—Sansa is a young woman who has seen more than her share of tragedy and abuse throughout her life. She watched her father killed in the most violent manner, she was threatened and abused by her king, kidnapped, forced into marriage, beaten, lied to, manipulated, and repeatedly raped. She found herself, time and again, alone in the world surrounded by enemies and faithless friends.

This season, after escaping her nightmare imprisonment by Ramsay Bolton, Sansa is reunited with her long-lost “half-brother” Jon Snow. The two wrap their arms around each other as if there is no one else in the world. Finally, one of the few people Sansa can rely on is back in her life after many years of pain and torment.

Sansa Stark Doesn’t Trust Anyone

They plan to recapture their home and re-establish Stark rule in the North. But there’s a problem. Sansa doesn’t trust anyone. She admits this to Petyr Baelish, a political schemer who has lied to and used her on more than one occasion. Her distrust of the man who has said, with boldface honesty, “Don’t trust me” comes as no surprise given their history. But why shouldn’t she trust her brother, Jon? He’s good to the core.

When Jon is planning their battle against the Boltons, Sansa lies to him about information she had received regarding a relative in the South who has an army. Her protector, Brienne, who knew it was a lie, asks her, “Why did you lie to him?” This was after Sansa had admitted Jon is trustworthy. She offers Brienne no explanation.

This scene spurred a lot of discussion on social media about why she didn’t trust him. Was Sansa scheming behind Jon’s back? Was she planning on doing something that could hurt Jon? Later, after Jon discovers she had actually helped him by calling on Baelish’s army to save them, he tells her, “We need to trust one another.” After that, Sansa, still looking doubtful, seems to act on his admonition, allowing her brother to take control of the North once they defeated the Boltons.

But even as she did this, she makes eye contact with Baelish, who clearly doubts her decision and gives her a look that says, “You’ll pay for this. You can’t trust him.” The look Sansa gives in return seems to indicate she knows he might be right.

So trust is a huge deal for Sansa. But why is it so hard for her to trust Jon, who loves her? Anyone who has been through abuse knows the answer immediately. When you have been abused, trust is painfully difficult. You simply don’t trust anyone, not even those who have never betrayed you. They can tell you they love you. They can show you they have your best interests at heart, but it’s nearly impossible for you to really trust them. You remain guarded. You refrain from intimacy. You defend yourself even when they aren’t attacking you. You cower from the world, living in fear.

No One Can Save Me, Not Even You

Sansa had seen and experienced abuse and betrayal unlike anything most people would ever experience. When you’ve been betrayed, when you’ve been powerless and abused, trusting someone is a struggle, not only because you know what monsters people can be, but because you don’t even trust the people who are good. You don’t trust them because they are powerless. They can’t really keep the monsters from creeping into the closet at night.

While you might want to trust them, you don’t because no matter how well their intentions, they are impotent to do anything to help you. Most of the time, that’s not their fault. Life is unpredictable, and they just might not be there for you because of circumstances beyond their control. Or they could be put in situations where they have to choose themselves over you, and most people are driven by self-interest, no matter how kind and loving they might be.

Either way, when you’re already doubting people, you’re not likely to trust because you see how little people can control what happens. Somehow, some way, someone is going to hurt you. That’s what you believe in your heart. That’s why Sansa didn’t trust Jon.

If someone in your life has been abused, please show them a great deal of grace about the matter of trust. If they lash out or recoil from you, it’s not because they’re cruel or because you’re bad or even because you have done anything wrong. It’s because they’re wounded, and that pain is raw. Any threat or perceived betrayal or sense of abandonment causes them to attack or withdraw into themselves to protect the hurt.

We Snarl In Reflexive Self Defense

Our family had a little Australian Silky who came to us after having been abused as a puppy. She was lame in one leg, which we suspected was the result of abuse. She was a sweet, loving dog, but sometimes, if we moved toward her unexpectedly, she would bar her teeth and snap at us. We might not be doing anything that was a real threat, but she would become defensive.

The children didn’t understand why she acted that way, and we often had to explain that she didn’t mean it and the kids weren’t doing anything wrong. She had been abused, and this was the sad result. It was important, we explained, not to react with similar hostility or defensiveness. Be gentle by remaining calm, we told them. So we loved her and tried to help her become more trusting. She did, but never perfectly.

It’s not much different with humans, although I have more hope for humans to overcome their fear. When we’ve been abused, especially when it’s someone who is supposed to be one of the safest people in our lives (a parent or a spouse), it ignites a flame of fear within that is hard to extinguish. Every sense of vulnerability, every threat, every failure, every lie, every hurt reminds us that people can’t be trusted. They’re all betrayers. We can only trust ourselves if we don’t want to suffer. We snap and snarl, barring our teeth, in our own defense.

Since people are imperfect and will eventually let us down, we can always find something to “prove” people are untrustworthy. Every failure is proof of betrayal. Every slight is perceived as a cruelty. As I mentioned before, even if they have the best intentions, even if we know they’re good people, we don’t trust they really have the power to help us.

I Never Knew When the Attack Would Come

One time when I was a child, I was being beaten by my father repeatedly because I was failing at my math homework. My pants were down and he was hitting me over and over because I didn’t know my times tables. Besides being in pain, I was terrified that I’d lose control and urinate all over him. What would he do to me then? I can remember how I tensed up all over, repeating in my mind, “Don’t pee. Don’t pee.”

What I remember most about that moment was looking up and seeing my mother standing by the refrigerator with tears in her eyes.

My father kept hitting me. “What’s four times three?” Wham. Wham. Wham. I couldn’t think. Even after I said “Twelve!” I got beat more until I repeated it several times, my father releasing the last vestiges of his anger until it finally expired in one last whack.

After that, while I certainly remembered my father’s beating (and I had plenty of others), what I remember most about that moment was looking up and seeing my mother standing by the refrigerator with tears in her eyes. She wasn’t hurting me. She was clearly grieving. She didn’t approve of what was going on. But she was powerless. Maybe she was afraid too. For whatever reason, she didn’t intervene.

She never did, not even when I’d be sitting at the dinner table and suddenly my father would backhand me across the cheek because he didn’t like the “look on my face” or when I was a little girl and he’d pin me against the wall as he yelled at me. I never knew when the attack would come, what I’d do or say to stir his ire, but it would come, and I was helpless. My mother also never stopped it. As a result, I didn’t trust my father or my mother. She had betrayed me as much as he had.

I learned as a child that not only could I not trust “bad” people who were powerful, but I couldn’t trust those who were “good” because they were powerless. I couldn’t trust anyone. As I went through life, that belief was reinforced as people let me down, hurt me, used me, and even abused me as an adult. It wasn’t until later that I realized how I contributed to much of this, as I was drawn to people who were selfish and abusive. But I also eventually learned (and continue to learn) that life doesn’t need to be a cycle of abuse and mistrust.

Love Means Pain, But It’s Better than the Alternative

Trust is definitely earned, and once it’s lost it takes a lot of work to rebuild it (and, with much grace, I have rebuilt it with my parents—I love them dearly and my mother is now my closest friend). But trust is also a choice. More than that, we must trust imperfect people. That means they’re going to disappoint us, even fail us. Our trust is perfectly secure only when it’s placed in someone who is both perfectly good and perfectly powerful. The only one who fits that description is God. Humans aren’t God. They’re terribly imperfect, even the best of them.

You can choose to trust, because there really is no alternative if you want to be happy.

Only by trusting ultimately in God despite all the bad in my life, then choosing as an act of faith to love and trust others (unless they have blatantly proven to be untrustworthy), have I found any measure of peace. The effects of abuse can only be overcome when you realize you’re not defined by your abuse and neither are other people. You can love. You don’t have to be afraid. You can choose to trust, because there really is no alternative if you want to be happy. My prayer these days is not “Keep me safe” but “Give me strength to love because love in this world is never safe. Give me the strength to suffer if suffering comes.”

As C. S. Lewis wrote in “The Four Loves,” “There is no safe investment. To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly broken.” If you want to be perfectly safe, to never hurt again, “You must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket—safe, dark, motionless, airless—it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. The alternative to tragedy, or at least to the risk of tragedy, is damnation. The only place outside of Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and perturbations of love is Hell.”

This quote reminds me of the animated film, “Song of the Sea,” where a magical creature, the witch Macha, turned her son into an island because he suffered from a broken heart. She never wanted him to hurt again, so she turned him to stone. As a result of her loss and pain, she began to attack others, turning anything with feeling into stone, transforming herself in the process. Only when she allowed herself to feel, to weep, to suffer, and to love, were she and everyone else released from their rocky prisons.

If we truly want to be happy, if we truly want to overcome the effects of abuse, we need to draw close to the One who loves us perfectly and choose to let down our stony guards and open our hearts to others. We do this, as Lewis says, “not by trying to avoid the sufferings inherent in all loves, but by accepting them and offering them to Him; throwing away all defensive armour. If our hearts need to be broken, and if He chooses this as the way in which they should break, so be it.”

It is a risk to love. It is a risk to choose to trust. But it’s worth it. It’s worth the risk because the alternative—the loneliness, the bitterness, the hell—is unacceptable. That’s not a life worth living. It is better to love and suffer, to love and be betrayed, to love and be used, to love and even feel the heavy hand of cruelty, than never to love at all; and trust is very much a part of love.

Why Aren’t Liberals Flogging Rotherham Pakistanis Over Their Rape Culture?,"Over the past 16 years more than 1,400 young girls between the ages of 12 and 16 living in Rotherham, England have been groomed for sexual exploitation on an “industrial scale.” This according to social workers, police officers, residents, and the victims themselves whom the Daily Express recently interviewed. These 1,400 young girls have been the victims of rape, torture, abduction, and forced prostitution—but that’s not even the worst of the news. The worst? British authorities have been knowingly letting it happen now for years.

The reason, while appalling, is unfortunately not surprising: An independent inquiry into who was running these child sex rings found that an overwhelming majority of the perpetrators were Pakistani men, and that, because of this, authorities feared accusations of racism if they pursued prosecution. Their fears aren’t entirely without foundation. The British Muslim Youth (BMY) organization has openly encouraged British Muslims to “cut ties” with authorities over what they perceive as an “unprecedented level” of Islamophobia.

While an update of the independent inquiry suggests authorities have slightly improved their response to these child sex abuse allegations in Rotherham, social workers who have been working with victims since the original report was released are openly questioning whether much has changed. In addition to British authorities taking little action regarding this shocking level of criminal activity within their communities, the media coverage in the British and international press has been relatively sparse.

Hm, Victime Blame Much?

Large-scale sex attacks by migrants from the Middle East are not only happening in Britain. At a train station in Cologne, Germany on New Year’s Eve as people gathered to celebrate the arrival of 2016, gangs of North African and Middle Eastern men raped, beat, and groped more than a thousand women. Unlike Rotherham, this occurrence did garner the world’s attention, but not in the way you would expect.

The mayor of Cologne, Henriette Reker, suggested a “code of conduct” for German women to help prevent future attacks by immigrant men from Third World countries, which included: “dressing more conservatively,” “keeping an arm’s length distance from strangers,” and “going out in groups.” New Statesman ran an article titled “After Cologne, We Can’t Let The Bigots Steal Feminism,” about how voicing feminist outrage over the attacks could wind up helping “Islamophobes” spread hate, and the popular feminist website Feministing called the media “unabashedly racist” for reporting the ethnicities of the attackers.

Was I really reading the coverage right? Were these allegedly liberal, feminist writers and politicians more concerned, in the aftermath of this attack, with the feelings of the communities of the attackers over the safety and dignity of the women who were harmed? Were they really willing to do the thing they are so quick to chastise others for doing: victim blame?

Let’s Try a Comparison Here

Keeping these two terrible situations of sexual assault happening in Europe in mind, let’s shift focus now to a rape case that occurred in the United States and grabbed our attention a few months ago. It rocked even the most diehard believers in the justice system. I’m speaking of course, about the Stanford rape case.

When Brock Turner, a white college freshman, brutally raped an unconscious woman behind a dumpster and only received a sentence of six months in jail, the entire country—including me—was outraged. How could there be such a gross miscarriage of justice? How could such a clear-cut case of deliberate barbarism meet what was basically the judicial equivalent of a “time out”?

The Internet reacted with anger and disbelief. A Change.org petition that demanded the judge who presided over the trial be recalled for his ruling garnered more than a million signatures (one of which was mine). More than just the petition, the Internet did what it normally does best when appalled: it preached.

This “preaching” took on the forms it normally takes— Facebook statuses, tweets, hashtags, and think-pieces by celebrities and non-celebrities alike. We needed to understand what had just happened. We needed to fathom the unfathomable. Most importantly, we needed to make a diagnosis. A week after the Stanford rape case became famous, a common consensus among cyberdom had at last emerged: The West is a rape culture.

One Incident a Rape Culture Makes; Yet Not 1,400?

The Stanford case was not simply a horrible fluke or a standalone instance of injustice, feminists cried. It indicated a “systemic” problem where Westerners blame victims of sexual assault and normalize male sexual violence (particularly straight white male sexual violence). Open letters to American fathers criticizing the way they raised their sons were featured on sites like Mashable and CNN; popular mommy bloggers wrote several-paragraph-long statuses about how “we need to talk about rape culture” and “we should teach men not to rape instead of victim-blaming by teaching our daughters how to ‘avoid’ being raped.”

I saw athlete culture get criticized; white people—as a group—got criticized, too. But the main lesson we were supposed to take away from Stanford was that there’s a problem, particularly with the straight white Western man, that needs fixing. There is something about straight white male culture that is causing sexual assault, and we have an obligation to step up and stop it—whatever “it” is.

While I was happy to see that people were outraged over a young woman not receiving justice, I was also a little confused. I wondered then why the reactions to the Cologne attacks had been so radically different from the reactions to the Stanford case. Was the disparity just a fluke? With the latest news coming out of Rotherham, I can’t say that it is.

While cries of “rape culture” were everywhere during Stanford, they are nowhere to be heard in the discourse surrounding the scant coverage of Rotherham, nor was it anywhere to be heard after the Cologne attack— despite the fact that the men these gangs were comprised of did come from cultures that routinely and systemically abuse women and treat them as inferior.

We’re Apologizing for Rape, People

This is a clear instance of what has gone wrong with modern liberalism in the West. Cultural relativism has taken priority over the rights of women, and only when white Western men (the pet favorite oppressor) strike is there a “brave” call to action. Western feminism— and it seems social justice warriors in general— are more concerned about “mansplaining” and “manspreading” than they are about the ever-increasing threat of Islamism and the glaringly obvious problem that arises when countries emphasize multiculturalism but don’t equally emphasize assimilation.

The message seems clear: If a white guy in his home country assaults a woman, it suggests an entire “rape culture” that needs to be addressed. But when Muslim migrant men from Third world countries assault a woman, it demonstrates our “lack of cultural sensitivity,” and to even remotely suggest that elements in their culture and religion are a contributing factor to their abuse of women is xenophobic and bigoted.

To conclude, the amount of “Western guilt” Birkenstock liberals are peddling isn’t just astoundingly stupid, it’s also incredibly dangerous. Liberalism needs to locate its balls, and start defending the values of the Enlightenment (including women’s rights) rather than shrivel like cowards in the face of a clash between barbarism and modernity.

"Trump Attack On Clinton's Stamina Obvious, Not Dog Whistle","Donald Trump gave a speech on combating radical Islam on Monday. Shockingly, considering it was delivered by Donald Trump, it was not bad. Fred Barnes at The Weekly Standard said it wasn’t enough to answer questions of Trump’s fitness for office, but it was a good start.

Trump compared the fight against Islamic terror to the fights against fascism, Nazism, and Communism. He briefly listed the many recent attacks on U.S. soil by ISIS and other Islamist terrorists. He talked about the horrific attacks by Islamist terrorists in Paris, Brussels, Nice, Normandy, and on a German train. He also discussed ISIS attacks on and persecution in the Middle East.

Trump said radical Islam can’t be allowed to spread, that people unable to name the enemy are not fit to lead the country, that those who cannot condemn radical Islam lack the moral clarity to be president.

Trump didn’t just reiterate his view that the rise of ISIS is the direct result of the policies of President Barack Obama and his former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, he added to it. He brought up the Obama and Clinton policies that led to the destabilization of Libya, the destabilization of Syria, the destabilization of Egypt, the destabilization of Iraq, the tremendous growth of ISIS, and the strengthening of Iran.

Trump reminded listeners of what he called “President Obama’s global ‘Apology Tour'” where he repeatedly described the United States in negative terms. He contrasted this with the rhetoric of Reagan. He said Obama’s Cairo speech lacked the moral courage to tout the superiority of freedom.

It was this context into which he said:

The failure to establish a new Status of Forces Agreement in Iraq, and the election-driven timetable for withdrawal, surrendered our gains in that country and led directly to the rise of ISIS.



The failures in Iraq were compounded by Hillary Clinton’s disaster in Libya. President Obama has since said he regards Libya as his worst mistake. According to then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, the invasion of Libya was nearly a split decision, but Hillary Clinton’s forceful advocacy for the intervention was the deciding factor.



With one episode of bad judgment after another, Hillary Clinton’s policies launched ISIS onto the world.



Yet, as she threw the Middle East into violent turmoil, things turned out well for her. The Clintons made almost $60 million in gross income while she was Secretary of State.



Incident after incident proves again and again: Hillary Clinton lacks the judgement, the temperament and the moral character to lead this nation. Importantly, she also lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on ISIS, and all the many adversaries we face – not only in terrorism, but in trade and every other challenge we must confront to turn this country around.

Emphasis mine. Trump went on to speak against nation-building, in favor of crushing one’s enemies and seizing their assets, and in favor of prioritizing the fight against Islamist terror. He said the United States should work with Russia to fight ISIS. He listed military operations, blocking of finances, expanded intelligence sharing, and targeted cyberwarfare. He called for ideological warfare, in which the United States condemns radical Islam. He called for limiting and screening immigrants to make sure radical Islamists aren’t given access to the country through immigration procedures. And he said the FBI’s pattern of missing Islamist threats needed to be changed.

In any case, some journalists began hearing the boldfaced portion as a “dog whistle.”

Here’s how The Daily Beast categorized its snippet on his remarks:

The dog whistle The Daily Beast heard was different than the dog whistle other journalists heard, though not all. On MSNBC and CNN, there were discussions about this being a secret dog whistle about Hillary not being able to fight terrorism effectively because she’s a girl. On The Daily Beast, the dog whistle was supposed to signal she was physically unfit.

Donald Trump suggested—as he has in the past—that Hillary Clinton is somehow secretly ill. This time though, Clinton lacks the ‘mental and physical stamina’ to take on ISIS, which comes just a week after conspiracy theories bubbled to the surface once again saying that the Democratic nominee has some terminal ailment.

Is it time to review what a dog whistle is? A dog whistle is, according to Wikipedia, “political messaging employing coded language that appears to mean one thing to the general population but has an additional, different or more specific resonance for a targeted subgroup.”

Saying that Hillary Clinton lacks the physical and mental stamina to take on ISIS is literally saying the thing that supposedly needs to be dog whistled as a supersecret message. It can’t be secret, coded messaging when it’s the thing he says!

It’s the same thing independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin just said about Donald Trump.

Journalists should feel free to disagree with what Trump says, and openly state their rather obviously held beliefs that Hillary Clinton has the judgment, temperament, and moral character to lead the country. They should feel free to note that they believe she has the physical and mental stamina to take on ISIS. But there is no need to say that the words Trump is openly saying are a dog whistle.

Besides, can’t we move on to a better quality of coverage? For journalism’s sake?

Real test for media to actually look at substance of very serious Trump speech on radical Islamists. Bold contrast with Hillary's failures



Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) August 16, 2016

True. There is a disturbing pattern of the media doing everything in its power to avoid discussions about U.S. foreign policy, particularly as it relates to Islamist terrorism. This is just the second example in under a week.

Granted, Trump’s speech — and that of his surrogates — is frustratingly non-specific. Still, political reporters’ extreme swings from hyperliteralism to super–fine-tuned dog-whistle detection comes off as erratic. We’d be better served if reporters provided some calm journalistic coverage.

Perhaps spending less time hearing dog whistles and more time just noting the different foreign policy approaches of these two presidential candidates is in order. This speech provides just that opportunity.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/08/16/trumps-attacks-on-clintons-stamina-are-obvious-not-dog-whistles/,2016-08-16
German Government Recommends Stockpiling To Prepare For Terrorist Attacks,"This week, Germany’s Interior Ministry revealed an update of its civil defense plan, the first such revision since the end of the Cold War era. The 69-page document advises Germans to stockpile a 10-day supply of food and five-day supply of water to prepare for an unspecified event that could upset the über-orderly country. Many in Germany aren’t taking this advice seriously, which reminds us all of the precarious prosperity we enjoy.

The civil defense plan, which Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere presented to his cabinet Wednesday, recommends improving alarm systems, strengthening hospital capacity, and putting civilians to work directing traffic or providing the military with lodging, if a crisis arises. The report also hints at bringing back military conscription, which ended in 2011.

Why the sudden update? What kind of disaster is the government anticipating that would cause Germans to need to stockpile food? That’s not exactly clear.

According to the document, “an attack on German territory requiring conventional defence is unlikely,” but nevertheless Germany needs to be “sufficiently prepared in case of an existence-threatening development in the future that cannot be ruled out.” The document also indicates a need to be prepared for the possibility of a “hybrid” conflict, which could include cyber warfare. Maiziere said Germany must be ready for interrupted gas or oil supplies or food and water preserves being poisoned.

Obviously This Is about Terrorism

Deputy parliamentary leader of the Greens party Konstantin von Notz says it makes sense to update German’s civil defense plan, given that it hasn’t been updated since 1995. This is understandable, given that the international scene has changed a lot in the past 21 years. But he, too, doubts any attack on Germany would require this kind of stockpiling.

Of course the government doesn’t want to frighten the public by saying that the update of the civil defense plan is due to increasing threats to the country. But we can certainly read between the lines to see that this update is coming at a time when terrorism and international tensions are on the rise. Just recently, Germany’s defense minister said his country lies in the “crosshairs of terrorism.” It would be quite the coincidence if this updated plan just happened to co-occur with the rise of ISIS and the rash of attacks across Europe that recently added Germany to its list of casualties.

The civilian defense plan indicates the government sees real threats abroad, and doesn’t want its military or people caught unprepared. So it’s taking the appropriate steps and counseling Germans to take precautions.

But so far the German people aren’t taking it all that seriously. Since the news leaked earlier this week, social media and newspapers have lit up with jokes mocking the proposition. The term “Hamsterkaeufe” has become popular on social media, which has a double meaning of panic-buying, as well as hoarding like a hamster. Pictures of hamsters and jokes about stockpiling hamsters abound.

Are Citizens Really Prepared for an Emergency?

The plan is also stoking a debate about the necessity of such preparations, with some accusing the government of scaremongering. But Wolfgang Kast, a public health manager with the German Red Cross, worries this is an indication that the public isn’t really prepared for an emergency. An event that would require stockpiled food is so far off its radar that the mere suggestion seems silly and unnecessary.

This whole affair is a reminder of the incredible sense of security we all live with every day. For most of us who are under 40, that’s because life experience has taught us that catastrophes just don’t strike the Western world anymore. Other than the relatively small number of people affected by natural disasters each year, most people in the West haven’t experienced what it’s like not to have access to clean drinking water or food.

This has lulled us into an unrealistic idea of the world. Thinking that nothing could require us to stockpile food, house troops, or pitch in to direct traffic is akin to the idea that history ended with the Cold War, and with it all major international conflicts. In the 1990s, it was popular to argue that all the major disagreements and ideological conflicts had finally been put to rest, as though humanity itself had undergone a transformation with the fall of the Berlin Wall. All that remained was to work out some details about trade and the environment.

There was a similar mood in the period between World War I and World War II, when Europe thought it unthinkable ever to go to war again. So it sleep-walked right into the nightmare of the Second World War. So, too, were we stunned by the reality of Islamic terrorism in September 2001, despite years of escalating attacks by al-Qaeda against U.S. targets overseas.

Good Time to Take Stock of World Affairs

But it’s not just the proliferation of Islamic terrorism that threatens Germany’s, and our own, security. International tensions are on the rise, and old powers are rising again unchecked. Fighting is bubbling up again on the Ukrainian border between pro-Russian separatists (widely thought to be backed by Russian troops) and the Ukrainian armed forces. Strains with China are also on the rise, with China asserting itself in the South China Sea. Next month it plans to conduct naval exercises there—with Russia.

In the weeks after the attempted military coup in Turkey, President Recep Erdogan’s government has pivoted toward Russia (much like it did following WWI and the breakup of the Ottoman Empire) and away from the West. Iran has reasserted itself in the Middle East, showing its desire to be a regional power in places like Syria and Yemen. It, too, is allying with Russia, even letting Russian fighter jets to take off from Iran (until the media attention got too hot).

Is it really so far-fetched to think that something like a cyber attack by China that affects the electric grid could turn Germany upside-down for a short time?

None of this means the end is nigh, or that you need to be buying giant barrels of grain and digging your own well. But it does mean international realities cannot be ignored, and that our Western utopian peace may not last forever. To pretend otherwise would be to join the chorus of voices throughout history who saw the danger on the doorstep too late.

In Germany, the government is making a modest recommendation to mitigate the damage should something happen. This seems utterly reasonable—and utterly foolish to ignore.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/08/26/german-government-recommends-stockpiling-prepare-terrorist-attacks/,2016-08-26
The Left Has Cried Wolf On Republicans So Long Trump Is Immune,"New York Times columnist Frank Bruni, considering the charges of racism and hate-mongering lodged against GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, asks: “Did Democrats cry wolf so many times before Trump that no one hears or heeds them now?” He quotes Democratic communications maven Howard Wolfson, who worked on the campaigns of John F. Kerry and Hillary Clinton, as concluding there is some truth to the charge.

There has been pushback against this heresy in the world of Acela journalism, mostly on Twitter, but most notably from Chris Cillizza in the Washington Post. Cillizza asserted:

First, while the rhetoric about George W. Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney was overheated at times — and there are certainly anecdotes to be mined in each case — they never faced anything close to the consistent drumbeat of accusations about racism, sexism, demagoguery or fascism, as Trump has.



Bush was painted as not particularly bright, as deceiving the country into going to war, and later on as being uncaring in the face of Hurricane Katrina. Kanye West intoned during a Katrina benefit show that “George Bush doesn’t care about black people,” but the idea that Bush was a racist, demagogue, or fascist was never widely circulated.

Were You Around for the Bush Years?

I am not sure where Cillizza was during the Bush administration. During the controversy over Bush’s Electoral College win, Jesse Jackson claimed the Bush campaign had used “Nazi tactics” and his brother Jeb had targeted Holocaust victims (part of a history of Jackson’s Nazi analogies).

Antiwar demonstrations routinely featured “Bush as Hitler” imagery. Iconic columnist Jimmy Breslin directly compared Bush’s speech at the outset of the Iraq War to one Hitler gave when launching World War II. Former United Nations weapons inspector Scott Ritter compared the invasion of Iraq to Hitler’s invasion of Poland. Ralph Nader quoted Michael Kinsley as claiming “in terms of the power he now claims, George W. Bush is now the closest thing in a long time to dictator of the world.”

Cindy Sheehan, who was afforded “absolute moral authority” and passels of pixels to attack the Bush administration after she lost her son Casey in Iraq, compared Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to Hitler and Stalin. Sen. John Glenn, acting as a surrogate for Kerry’s 2004 campaign, compared alleged GOP misstatements to the propaganda of Nazi Germany. Progressive mega-financier George Soros made similar claims regarding GOP propaganda.

Sen. Robert Byrd, ironically a former Klansman, launched such attacks more than once. Al Gore accused the Bush administration of working with “digital brownshirts” to suppress dissent from the media. Rep. Keith Ellison compared the Bush administration’s response to 9/11 to the Reichstag fire that assisted Hitler’s rise to power. Television producer Ed Gernon was fired from the CBS miniseries, “Hitler: The Rise of Evil,” after telling the media that Bush’s post-9/11 policies and the popular support for them were reminiscent of—you guessed it—Nazi Germany.

Newsweek later proclaimed that, with respect to the NSA eavesdropping program, “We’re seeing clearly now that Bush thought 9/11 gave him license to act like a dictator, or in his own mind, no doubt, like Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War.” Slate’s Jacob Weisberg asked whether Bush was turning America into an elected dictatorship. MSNBC’s Keith Olbermann, in full self-righteous dudgeon, called Bush a fascist during one of Olbermann’s famous “Special Comments.”

Chris Matthews chatted with far-left propagandist Michael Moore about the idea of trying the administration Nuremberg-style for waging the Iraq War. Former Gore adviser Naomi Wolf wrote that Bush was taking all the steps necessary to create a fascist America. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman’s “The Great Unraveling” featured a jacket with Dick Cheney sporting a Hitler-esque mustache made of oil.

In “Liberal Fascism,” Jonah Goldberg notes that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. compared the Bush years to the rise of Mussolini, while Norman Mailer called America a “pre-fascist society,” and renowned political scientist Theodore Lowi called the Republicans “friendly fascists.” Andrew Sullivan, who bows to no man regarding hysterical hyperbole, saw nascent dictatorship even in the Bush administration’s response to the 2008 financial crisis.

Did You Watch a Movie or Listen to Music Then?

Cillizza did manage to recall Kanye’s televised attack on Bush. But West was far from alone among those in pop culture and the arts attacking Bush and other GOP nominees. That list includes, but is not limited to Linda Ronstadt, Tony Bennett, Black Sabbath, and Madonna (who likened McCain to Hitler, among other dictators).

When the antiwar group World Can’t Wait ran a full-page ad in USA Today comparing Bush to Hitler and claimed “[t]he Bush regime is setting out to radically remake society very quickly, in a fascist way, and for generations to come,” it was signed by Ed Asner, Ed Begley Jr., Harry Belafonte, Gabriel Byrne, Rep. John Conyers Jr., Michael Eric Dyson, Steve Earle, Daniel Ellsberg, Eve Ensler, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Jane Fonda, Paul Haggis, Kathleen Hanna, Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, Rickie Lee Jones, Casey Kasem, Ron Kovic, Jonathan Kozol, Jessica Lange, Lewis Lapham, Rep. Cynthia McKinney, Tom Morello, Rep. Major Owens, Harvey Pekar, Sean Penn, Harold Pinter, Mark Ruffalo, Rep. Bobby Rush, Susan Sarandon, Rev. Al Sharpton, Martin Sheen, Gloria Steinem, Studs Terkel, Gore Vidal, Kurt Vonnegut, Alice Walker, Rep. Maxine Waters, Cornel West, and Howard Zinn—to name a few.

In 2005, Rep. Charlie Rangel claimed “George Bush is our Bull Connor,” referring to the Birmingham, Alabama police commissioner who in 1963 turned fire hoses and attack dogs on blacks and other civil rights protesters, including Martin Luther King Jr. (Note: Connor was a Democrat.) This absurd charge received thunderous applause at a Congressional Black Caucus town hall meeting attended by Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and some of Rangel’s colleagues in the House. If the establishment press ever asked Obama or Clinton about Rangel’s inflammatory speech—as any Republican would be about a similarly offensive slander—I could find no record of it.

Or Maybe You Weren’t Reading Newspapers

Cillizza may be partially correct to claim there was less of a drumbeat of such claims against McCain and Romney. Of course, that assertion overlooks that neither of those men became president, and both campaigns were likely quite aware they could be attacked as racists while running against Obama. But even a few moments with a search engine would have revealed Rep. John Lewis comparing McCain rallies to those held by George Wallace.

And Ezra Klein asserting a McCain campaign video looked like “an over-the-top parody of fascist campaign propaganda from a movie, and sounds like Triumph of the Will.” And Josh Marshall claiming that McCain’s ad painting Obama as a celebrity candidate was intended to link Obama to “oversexed and/or promiscuous young white women.” And the media debate over the seminal question of whether McCain referring to Obama as “that one” was racist. And the Obama campaign’s claim that McCain was playing racial politics for daring to suggest that Obama was preemptively accusing him and the GOP generally of racism.

Again, this list is hardly comprehensive. Perhaps Cillizza and people like him do not remember the sort of horse manure progressives spread about Republican nominees in every election cycle precisely because it is so ridiculous and embarrassing to the Left. Or perhaps these comments do not strike the establishment media as scandalous simply because Democrats made them.

Or perhaps Cillizza and others have failed to hear this drumbeat because the drum sounded so softly on the pages of Acela journalism. To be sure, some of the Democratic attacks mentioned above were reported by CBS, CNN, and even the Washington Post, but none received the national media firestorm that comments from Republicans like senatorial candidate Todd Akin would. To the contrary, the Washington Post’s mention of Glenn’s Nazi analogy was tossed off in the final paragraph of a story as a comment of trivial consequence.

Maybe Your Sources Are Biased

Beltway journalists largely live in the world where polls about GOP birthers are hyped immediately (despite birtherism originating with Clinton supporters) but the majority of Democrats who thought Bush was complicit in the 9/11 attacks does not get blurbed until 2011.

The media rightly excoriated Trump for not immediately disavowing the Klan in a television interview. In contrast, The New York Times, Chris Matthews, and many others gushed when Obama delivered a prepared speech in which he generally criticized the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, but largely avoided explaining his longstanding membership in a church preaching black identity politics, and asserted he could no more disown Wright than he could the black community or his white grandmother.

Of course, Wright then went on a media tour so typically odious that Obama dumped him for good a month later. The Acela press also cheered that move and generally avoided mentioning the flip-flop, except perhaps as evidence of Obama’s keen political instincts.

Republicans, on the other hand, live in the world where all of those irresponsible attacks by Democrats are ignored or downplayed by the national media. They live in the world where the double-standards of the Democrat apparat and the establishment media (Do I repeat myself?) are glaring. They note that the establishment media routinely goes easy on remarks by Democrats that would be multi-day sagas and possible career-enders if uttered by a Republican.

They live in the world in which it was a minor story when Vice President Joe Biden told a crowd including many African-Americans that Romney would “put y’all back in chains” by unshackling Wall Street. They know Biden said that after skating on his remark that “you cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin’ Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent.”

They recognize that when Hillary Clinton cannot tell you about a meaningful conversation with her black friends, but can say they have tried to expand her musical tastes, it does not seem to generate the same sort of press it would coming out of a GOP nominee’s mouth. In this world, it is not remotely surprising that many Republicans have stopped taking the Democrat-Big Media axis as seriously during its pious sermons on fascism or racism.

Frank Bruni has noticed the world Republicans have seen for decades. Democratic consultant Wolfson sees it. Cillizza and much of the establishment media, however, are yet to get woke.

Museum Trips Will Not Keep Italy's Teens From Islamism,"Italy has a new plan to push back against Islamic radicalization of European youth. It wants to give them European culture. This month, Italy will begin offering all 18-year-olds a voucher worth approximately $500 to use on concerts, movies, and museum visits. The premise is that cultural exposure can counter Islamic terrorism. Although this is perhaps a well-intentioned effort to wage an ideological war against Islamism, Italy’s program is unlikely to work.

Italy is correct to want Muslim youths to embrace Western culture as an alternative to turning to radical Islam; however, it’s mistaken in thinking this cultural shift can be forced or that mere exposure to Western culture will have the desired effect.

Italy’s new program, which will run through the end of 2017, will cost the country approximately $300 million. It was first announced soon after the attacks last November on the Bataclan theatre in Paris, where Islamic terrorists killed 130 people. Although its fundamental purpose is to counter radicalization, the vouchers will be available to all 18-year-olds, regardless of religion or ethnicity.

Italy is not the first European country to engage in an ideological battle in an attempt to dissuade youth from radicalizing. Britain has a program called “Prevent” that targets “at-risk youth”—those from Muslim families—and offers them counseling. This program has been criticized for stigmatizing and ostracizing Muslims, and for being a pathway for police surveillance of the Muslim community in Britain.

Germany has a number of counter- and de-radicalization programs, based on similar programs from the 1980s and ‘90s for neo-Nazis. These have had dubious outcomes. Earlier this year, a 16-year-old student threw a bomb into a Sikh temple. These types of programs have also been considered with skepticism because, as one former Salafist notes, “You can’t get anyone out unless he wants it.” So how do you make them want it?

Western Culture Isn’t that Effective, Either

Although Italy is trying to think outside of the box with its hybrid financial-cultural incentive, its plan is destined for failure. To begin with, most 18-year-olds are far more likely to use such a voucher to head to a movie or concert rather than a museum. In that case, how do movies and concerts, essentially vacuous pop culture, help influence young Muslim men not to radicalize? What values do they hold that would persuade a young man looking for a sense of identity not to take refuge in an extreme religious sect?

Many of the terrorists who’ve targeted Western countries in the last year were much engaged in Western pop culture—going to clubs and concerts, drinking, dancing—often just days before launching an attack. Salah Abdeslam, one of the Bataclan attackers, was co-owner of a night club. (Even the 9/11 attackers reportedly visited strippers in Las Vegas and Daytona Beach.)

Furthermore, are movies and concerts really at the heart of the culture that Italy wants its people to engage in? What about encouraging support for and engagement of principles like freedom of expression and democracy? These are certainly more crucial for preserving European culture than going to see an action movie.

Even if Muslim youth did choose to use their vouchers for museums, it’s not clear this would produce any positive effects, either. In Paris, all students have free admission to public museums, but this has hardly slowed North African youth from turning to Islamism and launching terrorist attacks in France.

The fact is, exposure to Western culture—not insulation from it—has a history of inspiring some Muslims to turn to Islamic extremism and terrorism. Sayyid Qutb, a leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1950s and ‘60s, spent time as an exchange student in the United States, and partly this experience helped push him toward radical Islam and indicting the West.

Try Cutting the Welfare State that Funds Your Enemies

What’s more, financial assistance in whatever form is just as likely to hurt as help. Europe’s welfare state has been proven to subsidize terrorism, not counter it. Several of the terrorists involved in the Brussels and Paris attacks had been receiving various kinds of stipends and financial aid from the Belgium government. This money helped sustain them while they were planning their attacks.

Financial subsidies help make it possible for Islamic extremists to engage in terrorist activities. In fact, in its 2015 guide titled “How to Survive in the West,” ISIS encouraged followers in Europe to take advantage of any financial aid they can to help fund their plots or trips to Iraq and Syria.

Regardless of the drawbacks of the specific plan, Italy has succeeded in identifying a key problem involved in combatting Islamic radicalization: the Muslim population in Europe is largely not embracing Western culture. Unless they do, there will continue to be a gap between Muslim and non-Muslim Europeans, and Islamic extremism will continue to take hold. This is the central problem facing Europe.

The government official in charge of the voucher program, Tommaso Nannicini, says its purpose is to send a message and a reminder of “how crucial culture is, both for personal enrichment and for strengthening the social fabric of the country.” Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi called it a “cultural battle” that must be won. They are both right.

Yet Italy has still failed to see that no country can force a people to embrace one culture and abandon another. Nor can they be bribed into it. France has learned this lesson with its burkini ban experiment. Cities like Nice tried to forbid Muslim women from wearing the full-body covering to beaches, insisting the clothing violates the republican principle of equality of the sexes. Nice police went so far as to order women who were violating the order to strip in front of other beach-goers. Government actions like these will not only fail in assimilating Muslims, but further alienate them. (Thankfully, the burkini ordinance was overturned last week.)

The ultimate goal of encouraging engagement with European culture is to protect and preserve that culture. But, as I’ve written previously, this is precisely what Europe has been reticent to do for a variety of reasons. How can European countries possibly ask their Muslim citizens to assimilate to a culture that the countries themselves are too ashamed to defend? Italy’s recognition of what Europe must do is a good sign, even if its voucher program is fraught with problems.

The idea of encouraging appreciation of European culture is apt to offend some who don’t like the idea of asking immigrants to adjust or change. These people think immigrants should be able, and even ought, to live in cultural enclaves while taking advantage of the economic benefits of their new home. Italy’s new program is, therefore, bound to find resistance and criticism, and is unlikely to be replicated in whatever form. This is an unfortunate reality of our politically correct age.

Italy’s cash-for-culture program is likely to produce little fruit. But the fact that they understand the importance of culture and its role in the battle against Islamic extremism is a positive sign in these dark days for Europe.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/09/07/museum-trips-will-not-keep-european-teens-islamism/,2016-09-07
I’ll Never Forget What I Saw At The Pentagon After 9/11,"In summer 2005, I visited the Smithsonian’s American History museum in Washington DC with a couple of Marine friends. All of us were stationed in DC at the time. We were nursing wounds from our experiences in the Global War on Terror, and wandered around the museum admiring various pieces collected from our nation’s history.

I pushed one of my friends in a wheelchair because an improvised explosive device had shattered his leg; the same IED killed three of his friends. It had not yet dawned on me that a 9-11 exhibit might already be on display since it had only been four years, but we rounded a corner and there before us hung a massive American flag.

The room was crowded with visitors, many of them high school students. People were posing, laughing, and making funny faces as they took pictures. I was stunned. My friends were enraged. They turned to look at me. There we stood staring at the American flag that had hung on the side of the Pentagon days after 184 people were murdered on-site in this nation’s largest terrorist attack in history. We all thought: Is nothing sacred? Is four years long enough to forget? Is joking around appropriate in the face of such suffering and evil?

To be fair, these kids were young when 9/11 happened. They were probably 10 or 11 on that fateful day, and irreverence is often a part of youth, but they should have known better. Nearly 3,000 people perished that day, and countless more have died since at the hands of terrorists.

What We Saw that Day

My memories of that flag will forever be different from the majority of Americans and the rest of the world. While most remember it blowing in the breeze in news reports or when they visited the American History museum, I was there in person to see it. I saw it for the first time when, after volunteering at the Army base where I was stationed north of DC, I helped 400 grieving family members visit the Pentagon crash site shortly after the attack. I still see in my mind’s eye the gaping hole, floors collapsed in on one another, smoke rising from the smoldering ashes, the tormented faces of loved ones.

The intensity of seeing the site was amplified a thousand-fold by standing alongside agonized grieving family members; many of whom collapsed at my feet from the sheer weight of their pain. When those families visited for the first time after terrorists flew a plane into that iconic building, I struggled to keep military bearing while standing by in my dress whites, but it became impossible as tears streamed down my cheeks.

One of the clearest memories I have is of the general in charge. He had escaped from the fire that erupted in his office after the blast. Seeing my tears during this family visit, he checked on me. I had never seen so many stars in person, and I was embarrassed for showing what I thought was weakness, but he only said: “Are you alright, sailor?” He knew the tremendous burden of relief work. He was a truly kind man and the type of general a soldier would want to follow into battle.

My immediate thought in seeing the site was: There are no survivors. My second thought was: I am staring into the gates of Hell. While we were in the initial rescue phase then, the site looked like a tomb. This proved to be correct, since there were no survivors. In fact, many bodies were never recovered because of the heat from the blast. I spent 45 days listening to such grisly details as I provided logistical and emotional support to the family members of those killed.

‘We Thought We Were Going to Die That Day’

When 9/11 occurred, I was a Third Class Petty Officer in the Navy, just shy of the two-year mark of my enlistment. I was new to the DC metro area. I had only been stationed on my base for two months on the morning of September 11, 2001. My base was considered a high-priority target, so once the Pentagon was hit all hell broke loose. I remember civilians running to their cars and fleeing the base. All of the Marines were armed and sent to secure the perimeter. The Navy, Army, and Air Force secured various areas and set up barricades. People were running all over the place. Everyone was bracing for impact.

I spent most of the day barricaded in an office in the Marine barracks with a friend of mine who was eight months pregnant. Her Marine husband worked in the Pentagon. The phone lines were jammed, so there was no way for us to contact him or to even know which side of the building, or which ring, he was working in. All we could do was keep each other calm as we prepared for impact every single time a jet engine was heard overhead. We thought we were going to die that day. No one knew that day what kind of attacks would take place or where.

Thankfully, my friend’s husband was able to reach us seven hours later. He had hitchhiked up I-395 and found a ride home. The phone lines opened so we could call our families to tell them we were safe. My own parents were beside themselves because it wouldn’t have been entirely out of the question for me to be at the Pentagon that morning.

Two days later it came down the chain that the Pentagon Family Assistance Center set up to aid the families of those killed needed Navy volunteers. My command wanted to send eight people, and I immediately volunteered alongside a good friend of mine. The Navy lost more people in the Pentagon attack than any other branch of service or civilian agency. They wanted us to be a presence to all of the sailors’ families in case a mom, dad, brother, sister, grandmother, fiancé, fiancée, wife, husband, or any other relative needed a shoulder to cry on or a chance to talk about their loved one.

My memories of being a relief worker encompass a wide range of emotions and experiences. The first two weeks were a period of intense agony for the grieving. At this time the operation was considered a rescue, so hope was still alive even though most of us working in the center knew the situation was grim.

The Pentagon site was mostly cleared in about two weeks, and completely done by a month after the attack. The gruesome task of identifying bodies took the longest, but most families had a casket for burial by the end of my time as a relief worker near the latter part of October. What had begun as unquenchable agony turned to resignation. The opportunity for a funeral provided families with some level of closure, so they could begin the long process of grief and healing.

Good Triumphs Evil, and We Proved It

Periods of great tragedy reveal the worst in human nature, and the best. I met some of the most amazing people I have ever met in my life during that time. From the general in charge to the family members of those killed, the power and perseverance of the human spirit was on display. American flags flew everywhere, and firefighters and service members cheered each other on to complete the difficult task at hand. Being a relief worker comes with intense burdens, and every single one of us collapsed in anguish at least once, but we continued for the sake of the surviving family members.

These were the memories flashing before my eyes standing beneath that flag four years later, and they are the same memories with me today, 15 years later. I am not distanced from those events. I was a part of the response to a great evil and period of intense suffering for our nation. The relief workers of that time—from the firefighters to the service members to the Red Cross to the countless other volunteers—prove that evil never triumphs. Evil may have its moment, but good always overcomes evil. That flag represents the human faces of the lost and the family members who loved them.

My Marine friends’ concern was not only for the irreverence of those visiting the exhibit, but also because, like so many relief workers, I was combatting Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) at the time. It is difficult to walk away from something so horrendous as 9/11 unscathed, and many relief workers struggled, or struggle now, with PTSD or medical conditions. Regardless, it is worth the price to serve those in need.

The next time you are visiting the American History museum in DC, look at that flag and think of the thousands lost, the families who loved them, and all of the relief workers who rushed in to help without counting the cost. Even 15 years later, the events of 9/11 have affected thousands of lives. Our entire nation and much of the world wept in the wake of such barbarity. We now live in an age when thousands worldwide battle the scourge of terrorism.

Today we remember a clear, blue, sunny morning and all that was taken, but we also remember the bravery, honor, courage, and sacrifice of those who ran in to help, many of whom died in the process. Today is not about politics. It is about remembering. Never forget.

Why You Can Expect To See More Violence In Schools This Year,"Two years ago I chased down a single dad whose son attended schools in the same district as the infamous Missourian Michael Brown. Sixty-six-year-old Paul Davis, a cab driver and son of Mississippi sharecroppers, decided to pay $1,500 in rent atop his mortgage just to get his son Robert out of some of the nation’s most violent schools by establishing residency in a better school district.

Davis told me about the time in fifth grade other black boys had held Robert down until he peed on himself; the time bullies stole his book bag; the many times they attacked Robert—in classrooms, in hallways, in the lunch room.

In middle school Robert, who has mild autism, became a favorite target for bullies because his mom is white and his dad is black, so “he was the lightest kid in the whole school.” Eight days into seventh grade, another boy shoved Robert’s arm between two desks. The teacher called an administrator, who took Robert to the nurse’s room. The nurse wasn’t there, so the administrator sent Robert back to class. And that was the end of it. Davis’s blood boiled.

“You do things wrong, you outta here, and you ain’t coming back,” he said. “That’s what they shoulda been doing in Normandy [School District].”

Robert’s former middle school sounds like a nightmare: “A boy got killed in the lunch room,” Davis told me. The kids were playing a “game” that involved taking turns punching each other as hard as they could. “One kid punched the other in the chest, and the other died. There were no criminal charges at all—they said they was playing…They got what they call in-school suspension, where they go in a room with the other bad kids, because the federal government—whatever way they allocate funds.”

Hide Your Kids, Hide Your Wife

Davis was about to file a federal complaint when a judge ruled that because Robert’s school district had lost its accreditation the children there could transfer to nearby school districts, nearly all of which performed better. The receiving school districts complained so mightily over the next year, however, that the state revoked that option, sending all the Normandy kids back to their still unaccredited schools.

That’s when Paul said “Aw, hell, no,” dipped into his meagre savings, and bought his youngest child a ticket outta Dodge—just in time to avoid the Ferguson riots that began that very summer.

As everyone knows, racial unrest has only increased since then, and is in fact linked with public campuses through gangs, personal relationships, and protest movements. The highly publicized race-related violence in city streets this summer erupted first inside public schools inside many of the same cities, including Baltimore, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and New York City.

Soon before school let out for a boiling hot summer of racial angst, local news reports depicted frightening levels of violence erupting inside the first school systems to implement new federally approved discipline policies. In Milwaukee, for example, teachers reported a spike in aggressive student behavior after the district began reducing its punishments for students to comply with federal guidelines. The stories are insane:

Gilbert Valdes was attacked by a third-grader who was transferred to his school after stabbing a girl in the face with a pencil. And Jennifer was attacked by a middle schooler who had just pummeled a sub and had been transferred from another school after violent behavior there as well. That girl had been placed in a special room for students with behavioral problems at Jennifer’s school, but the girl simply walked out, started roaming the hallways, and violently attacked Jennifer and another teacher.

Teachers in the Twin Cities threatened to strike over the levels of school violence they were enduring after their district began phasing in the new federal rules. The trigger incident, which came upon a wave of increased school violence:

a 55-year-old Central High School teacher was choked into unconsciousness after trying to break up a fight that started over an argument about football statistics. When the teacher intervened, a 16-year-old student allegedly picked up the teacher and slammed him into a table and chair, before slamming him to the floor. The teacher passed out for 10 to 20 seconds.

One Milwaukee teacher said a second grader slammed the teacher’s foot in a door and faced no consequences for it: “He was having some sort of emotional breakdown in the hallway and was kicking and slamming his body into the door, which was partially glass. I went out in the hall because the protocol is not to go after students, but I went out in the hall to make sure that, one, he wasn’t going to hurt himself and, two, that he wasn’t going to leave the building because that has happened as well.”

“He was in my classroom the next day,” she told Dan O’Donnell of Milwaukee’s News Talk 1130. “No repercussions. He sat in the office for an hour the day that it happened, but no, nothing happened.”

Thanks for the Ratchet, Feds

“Other teachers say that this is a common practice in their schools: Students will be issued a referral for misconduct and then ‘counseled’ before being returned to class without being formally disciplined,” O’Donnell reports. Why? Two levers the federal government is pulling, both related to school districts’ discipline numbers.

First, inside the Every Student Succeeds Act, which House Speaker Paul Ryan recently sped through Congress to replace No Child Left Behind, the federal government now includes measures besides test scores—such as annual suspension and expulsion rates—in ratings that influence funds and federal probes. Schools are technically supposed to report to the federal government every disciplinary action they take, and now they have more reasons to juice the numbers.

Second, back in 2011 former Education Secretary Arne Duncan and former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder told schools that consequences for bad behavior, not the behavior itself, was to blame for the “school to prison pipeline.” In 2014 the pair issued regulations telling schools they would be liable for federal investigation if they recorded data showing black or Latino students had committed more infractions than white or Asian students.

“Schools also violate Federal law when they evenhandedly implement facially neutral policies and practices that, although not adopted with the intent to discriminate, nonetheless have an unjustified effect of discriminating against students on the basis of race,” their subordinates wrote in a “Dear Colleague” letter (emphasis added).

Catch that? If schools have rules that apply equally to everyone, but it just so happens that more students of one race break those rules more than students of another race do, the federal government will consider that rule racist and could prosecute the school. This even though, as Jane Robbins summarizes, research shows “racial disparities in discipline result from differences in student conduct, not from racism.” This means these school discipline rules are likely to increase, not reduce, racism.

“Socioeconomic factors such as family income and childhood stress are some of the best predictors of student behavioral problems, and since variations in those influences are not evenly distributed by race, schools will have to engage in racial discrimination when meting out punishments,” wrote University of Colorado-Colorado Springs associate professor Joshua Dunn. “The victims will not be limited to unfairly punished students. All students who come to school to learn will have their education disrupted by troublemakers. In urban districts, those motivated learners will be primarily students of color.”

Now For Ineffective Kumbaya Circle Time

In response to these federal rules, states including Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Minnesota, California, and Washington have declared they will remove fewer violent students from classrooms through suspensions and expulsions.Children are not stupid. They have figured out that they can terrorize their peers and authority figures and get away with it now.

Schools are replacing stricter consequences with touchy-feely therapy sessions for troubled kids, which are less of a deterrent to bad behavior and often explicitly excuse it. The Wall Street Journal recently reported on one such program inside New York City schools:

One afternoon earlier this month, several students sat with three school safety agents. They spent three hours talking about prejudices based on hairstyle, neighborhood and background, and doing role-play exercises to understand each other’s views.

As a result of substituting these techniques for removing problem students from classrooms, citywide suspensions fell to 44,626 in 2014-15 from 69,643 in 2011-12, the Journal reports: “The past year’s citywide drop is largely due to the disciplinary code that took effect in April 2015, requiring principals to get approval from the education department before suspending students for defiance or insubordination.”

While these numbers will help keep the feds off administrators’ backs, it’s not clear they’re improving classroom safety. A report from an independent parents’ group using state data concludes New York City schools saw more violent incidents in 2014-15 than in 2011-12; even the city’s data shows that 2014-15 in-school violence roughly equaled that of the year previous.

‘Where is the justice for the students who want to learn?’

Since Indianapolis began a similar program in an effort to reduce suspensions for unruly students, classrooms and hallways have gotten more violent, a teacher told Chalkbeat Indiana this spring: “Without that threat [of suspension], he said, there were five fights in the hall outside his classroom during the first half of this year.” The same happened when Los Angeles schools implemented “restorative justice” programs in an attempt to get their suspension numbers down to keep the feds off their backs: “Where is the justice for the students who want to learn?,” asked eighth grade math teacher Michael Lam in a public meeting.

A Baltimore Public Schools teacher who asked me not to use her name for fear of losing her job has sent me several videos of students backtalking, ignoring her instructions, and acting aggressively in class. School discipline tactics are just a management tool, she noted; the root problem is students’ parents and homes, which nobody will discuss for fear of being called racists.

She and her colleagues hardly know what to do because: “There’s nothing the administration can do about it because you can’t suspend anybody, you can’t give detentions to anybody, and parents don’t care so you can’t call them…If you call a home parents are very likely to tell you [that] you are a racist. It used to hurt me, but now I say ‘98 percent of my kids are black, and I’m just being racist against your kid?’”

Let’s Aim Tanks At Misbehaving Kids?

While school staff are often victims of student violence, school officials aren’t innocent of contributing to these problems, typically with cowardice. School officials are afraid of federal sanction, career-ending accusations of racism (however spurious), and out-of-control students. Sometimes they also respond by gearing up. Like local police and also thanks to federal programs, school safety patrols are militarizing themselves.

This is a classic cycle of violence: Initial bad behavior leads to overreaction which prompts a corresponding overreaction, and so on.

This is again directly related to bad federal policy: a recent Huffington Post investigation found that a Bill Clinton-era federal program has pumped $867 million into increasing the presence of police in schools. “In 1997, the Department of Education reported that law enforcement officers were present in 10 percent of public schools at least once per week. By 2014, 30 percent of public schools had school resource officers, or SROs, the most common type of law enforcement on campuses.”

This is a classic cycle of violence: Initial bad behavior leads to overreaction which prompts a corresponding overreaction, and so on. It’s less important here who started it than it is that we stop the cycle. Besides, there’s plenty of blame to go around. Yes, far too many families have enabled and even encouraged dangerous behavior. Yet the proper response is not running away from those angry little children in fear nor running toward them only with handcuffs. Neither is it preventing schools from enforcing basic rules of conduct that allow every willing child to actually learn in peace.

Seven in ten Americans oppose the Obama administration’s racial quotas for school discipline. Majorities of Republicans, Democrats, blacks, and Hispanics oppose that policy (and black support switched between 2015 and 2016, from 65 percent support to 48 percent support). This should be low-hanging fruit to chop off and consign to the dustbin.

After that, there is a big debate about what to do with violent kids besides treating them like either criminals or misunderstood victims. Kids who act badly are neither. They are people just like the rest of us, who need to learn to own up to their bad choices and practice making better ones. While various schools attempt to figure this out, however, the rest of us can do two things. First, refuse to engage in the bigotry of low expectations by saying kids of certain races can’t be expected to treat their fellow humans well. Second, the most effective way to provide an immediate escape hatch for desperate families like the Davises is the thing that saved Robert Davis in the first place: taxpayer-funded school choice.

“I thank God for those Supreme Court judges who made that ruling” that allowed Robert to transfer to better schools, Paul Davis told me. “It not only changed me and Robert’s life, it changed other kids’ lives. Two thousand kids transferred at the same time—1,100 from our school district alone. That’s a lot of people.”

“I tell [Robert], ‘My happiness counts on you being happy.’ And it’s all of our responsibility. We all God’s children,” he said later in our conversation. “I’ve been a taxi driver for 22 years, and in those 22 years I’ve seen a lot of life. The one thing I see with the world today is children are not being kept safe. It’s hard to do better if you don’t know better. It creates a cycle. Until something happens to break the cycle, it continues.”",https://thefederalist.com/2016/09/15/can-expect-see-violence-schools-year/,2016-09-15
15 Things More Terrifying Than Trump Calling A Bomb A Bomb,"This weekend, individuals placed four sets of bombs in public places, two of them in New Jersey and two in New York City. By Monday morning, law enforcement officials had put out a request for sightings of Ahmad Khan Rahami, a naturalized American citizen from Afghanistan, in connection with the attacks.

A separate terrorist attack took place in a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota, where a man reportedly asked shoppers if they were Muslim before lunging at them with a knife. Eight people were injured before he was shot and killed by an ex-cop who’s now an NRA-certified full-time concealed carry instructor. He happened to be at the mall.

All of these attacks took place on Saturday and Sunday. Shortly after the first New York City bomb exploded, injuring dozens, Donald Trump spoke at a campaign rally where he said, “I must tell you that just before I got off the plane, a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows exactly what’s going on.”

This was a true statement, but it greatly alarmed the media on account of local law enforcement officials not yet explicitly saying the explosion that injured dozens was a “bomb.” They did that later.

Here are three things more terrifying than Donald Trump calling a bomb a bomb before local law enforcement officials called it a bomb.

1) Our Media Obsessing More About Trump Calling A Bomb A Bomb Too Early

The first New Jersey bomb went off in a garbage bin while no runners were around. A Marine race was scheduled to pass by during that time but had been rescheduled. Thankfully, no one was hurt. Less than an hour after a second bomb exploded in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, Trump made his statement.

With little other information to go on, and a media that has more or less lost its collective mind as it relates to covering Trump, here’s a small sample of what followed:

Trump, without confirmation of anything, tells CO crowd that a bomb went off in New York.



Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) September 18, 2016

Imagine what would happen if a president said something was a bomb that turned out to be not a bomb.



Blake Hounshell (@blakehounshell) September 18, 2016

Then Trump announced to a crowd in Colorado that ""a bomb went off in New York"" Wildly wreckless and irresponsible. https://t.co/ShG3KuBsMt



Joshua Chavers (@JoshuaChavers) September 18, 2016

@KatyTurNBC NYPD official, high up, didn't know what it was. Trump doesn't. Maybe he got bad info…



Justin Miller (@justinjm1) September 18, 2016

Now imagine roughly 3,000 groupthinking journalists all tweeting that in unison. This turned into headline after headline about how the major problem about a bomb going off in Chelse was that someone called it one before some agreed-upon approved time:

.@realDonaldTrump tells crowd that a ""bomb went off"" in New York amid reports of ""explosion"" in #Chelsea https://t.co/SbPnOUsYkl



CBS News (@CBSNews) September 18, 2016

Esquire published a piece headlined “Last Night, Trump Casually Told Everyone That a Bomb Went Off in New York“:

Last night, in a hangar in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Trump took 13 minutes to go on stage to address his supporters. He then decided to construct his own reality, as he so often does, by telling his supporters that a bomb went off in New York—before it was even confirmed that the explosion in Chelsea was a bomb.

CNN made an entire story out of “Trump says ‘bomb went off in New York'”:

Trump made the statement before local officials had publicly confirmed details of the incident or what caused the explosion. Typically, national political figures use caution when describing unfolding situations and law enforcement actions.

Let’s first note that Trump specifically said “a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows exactly what’s going on.” And let’s go ahead and also note that Hillary Clinton used the word “bombings” shortly thereafter:

After flying to NY, Clinton tells reporters she has been briefed on the ""bombings in New York and New Jersey and the attack in Minnesota.""



Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) September 18, 2016

The media asked her, moments after she said that word, whether she thought Trump was wrong to say it was a bomb. Because that’s a good question.

Now I don’t know if Trump was speaking rashly, as is his wont. Maybe he learned about the bombing in the briefing he received before he got off his plane. Maybe he has better sources in the NYPD than most media outlets do.

And if he was speaking rashly, as he did with the still unexplained crash of an EgyptAir flight in May, it’s worth the media mentioning it.

But as I wrote last night:

Y’all realize that freaking out over Trump calling it a bomb is more alarming to many Americans than calling a bomb a bomb too early, right?



Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 19, 2016

These headlines about Trump calling it a bomb are blatant press attempts to delegitimize him but they really come off like ads for him.



Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 19, 2016

Trump’s appeal to his supporters is based partly in his willingness to say obvious things, such as that a bomb went off in Chelsea and we don’t know exactly what’s going on. We have a political and media class that downplays the motivation for domestic terror attacks unless they are unrelated to Islamism. We have a political and media class unwilling to host substantive or meaningful debates about how to mitigate or prevent these attacks beyond fever dreams regarding removing the natural right of self defense.

A media that keeps telling people to calm down, a media that obsesses over whether someone called a bomb a bomb too early, a media that would focus on the timing of such a claim rather than, oh I don’t know, an ISIS attack at a mall in Minnesota, is one that produces far more anxiety than a presidential candidate saying something too early.

Also, a media establishment that immediately carried so much water for an administration that immediately blamed a Coptic YouTube filmmaker for Islamist attacks in Libya, Egypt and elsewhere is in no position to say a word about someone calling a bomb a bomb before some unknown agreed-upon time. Grow up.

2) President Obama’s Lack Of Interest In Domestic Terror

Presumably President Obama will get around to discussing the coordinated series of attacks that hit the United States this weekend, even if those attacks didn’t result in the carnage they could have. (Update: He got around to a few brief, detached remarks early Monday afternoon.)

Perhaps he’ll get around to it on Monday, more than 48 hours after the first attack on the Marine Corps race. It will be after I had my first nightmare that Islamist terrorists bombed the street near my house, putting the lives of those I love at risk. It makes me feel weird that I’m seemingly more concerned about a terror campaign than people actually elected to deal with national defense.

3) The Obama Administration’s Belief That The Battle Against ISIS Is A War Of Words

During a Monday morning television appearance on CNN, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the United States is engaged in a “narrative fight” with ISIS. This matches terminology we’ve heard from President Obama.

It’s true that battles with enemies willing to blow people up in the streets of Boston, Paris, Nice, and New York aren’t just waged with bullets and bombs, but the Obama administration’s unwillingness to take a murderous ideology seriously is deeply alarming.

4) Team Obama’s Longtime Downplaying of Islamist Terrorism

A year and a half ago, Byron York astutely noted that the Obama administration’s avoidance of a unity rally following horrific attacks on Charlie Hebdo was not surprising:

The uproar over whether President Obama or another top administration official should have attended the massive unity rally in Paris has obscured an important point about the White House’s reaction to the latest terror attacks in Europe. The administration no-shows were not a failure of optics, or a diplomatic misstep, but were instead the logical result of the president’s years-long effort to downgrade the threat of terrorism and move on to other things.

Whatever Obama’s actual strategy to counter Islamist terror is, the messaging from his administration sounds a lot like, “Calm down about ISIS.” And telling people to calm down about something is almost never a good way to get them to do so. Next time someone is upset about a legitimate problem, try telling them to calm down and report back what happens.

The last eight years have seen a plethora of Islamist attacks in this and many other countries. This administration has pooh-poohed concerns about the growing problem, no matter how gruesome or gory it may be. Every attack is done by a lone wolf who we shouldn’t worry our pretty little heads about. Nevermind that they rarely are lone wolves or that the “calm down” demand is never applied to actual lone wolf nuts who go on shooting sprees.

It’s a not particularly elegant form of gaslighting, and it is one of the main reasons people are questioning political elites’ ability to comprehend, much less manage or confront, the actual threat of Islamist terrorism.

Here are a few other things more terrifying than Donald Trump calling a bomb a bomb earlier than newsrooms would prefer.

5) A Coordinated Series Of Terror Attacks

Like the ones that happened this weekend in New York and New Jersey, involving a group of, uh, “lone wolves” targeting public spaces including race routes, neighborhoods, and rail lines.

6) Getting Stabbed By Terrorists In A Mall

Like the one that took place this weekend in St. Cloud, where the attacker reportedly asked if people were Muslim before stabbing them.

7) Getting Shot By Terrorists At A Nightclub

Like what happened to dozens of Floridians out for a night of fun at a gay club before dying at the hands of a heavily armed ISIS fighter in … Orlando.

8) Getting Gunned Down by an Islamist Colleague

Like what happened to 36 injured and murdered people in a terrorist attack at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, California.

9) Being Maimed and Murdered by Terrorists While Running a Marathon

Like what happened to hundreds of runners and observers at the Boston Marathon a couple of years ago when Islamist terrorists used pressure cookers to kill and maim as many people as possible. Six people died and 280 were injured, some extremely seriously.

10) Getting Run Down On Holiday By A Terrorist Driving A Truck

Like what happened to more than 500 people celebrating Bastille Day on the promenade in Nice. Some 86 people were murdered and another 434 were injured.

11) Being Killed For What You Publish

Like what happened to the cartoonists and other employees at Charlie Hebdo, when two Islamist terrorists forced their way into the heavily fortified offices of the satirical publication and used assault rifles to murder 11 and injure another 11.

12) Being Killed On A Terrorist-Hijacked Plane

Like what happened to passengers of four passenger aircraft that were used by Islamist terrorists to crash into the World Trade Center towers, the Pentagon, and what was supposed to be the U.S. Capitol.

13) Being Killed By Terrorists Using A Hijacked Plane

Like what happened to more than 3,000 Americans on September 11, 2001.

14) Being Targeted By Terrorists In Foiled Plots

Like what has happened to Americans from Portland, Oregon, to the Bronx in the last couple of decades.

15) Being Told By Your President And His Secretary Of State That A YouTube Video Caused Widespread Violence

Like what happened just four years ago when this administration repeatedly threw the First Amendment and an American practitioner of it under the bus to excuse violence and mislead Americans about an orchestrated and well-planned terror attack that killed four Americans, including a U.S. ambassador.

We could go on and on.

Donald Trump speaking more quickly than the media would like is certainly worth noting. It speaks to how he would handle himself as president. But a media class unable to see real threats while histrionically responding to every word Trump utters is doing little but helping his campaign succeed.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/09/19/15-things-more-terrifying-than-trump-calling-a-bomb-a-bomb/,2016-09-19
Hillary Clinton: These Terrorist Attacks Are All Trump's Fault,"After multiple terrorist attacks launched across the U.S over the weekend, Hillary Clinton placed blame at the feet of the man she says is responsible for recruiting ISIS terrorists across the globe: Donald Trump. Then she accused him of treason, a capital crime that carries the penalty of death under federal law.

“Donald Trump is being used as a recruiting sergeant for ISIS,” Clinton said on Monday morning. “The kind of language and rhetoric Trump has used is giving aid and comfort to our adversaries.”

Clinton’s accusation that Trump is “giving aid and comfort” to America’s enemies is a specific reference to the definition of treason in federal law (18 U.S.C. 2381):

Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.

On Saturday, 29 people were injured after a pressure-cooker device exploded. The suspect — who has been identified as Ahmad Khan Rahami, an Afghanistan-born man — has since been apprehended after a dramatic standoff with police Monday morning. Authorities suspect Rahami was also behind two other terror attacks in New Jersey — including a pipe bomb that exploded new near a Marine Corps charity race.

Clinton, who previously served as U.S. Secretary of State for four years and as a United States senator for eight years, did not explain how Trump was to blame for the government’s inability to prevent terrorists from attacking the homeland. Trump, a New York-based real estate developer, has never worked for the federal government.

Blaming Republicans for ISIS, however, isn’t anything new for Democrats.

During a trip to the Philippines last November, Obama said Republicans were serving as ISIS recruiters by trying to limit immigration to the U.S. In June, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tweeted that Senate Republicans were literally handing weapons to SIS fighters.

.@ChrisMurphyCT said it right: The @SenateGOP have decided to sell weapons to ISIS. — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) June 20, 2016

Ironically, the terrorist who killed 49 people at a nightclub in Orlando liked Hillary Clinton, according to a close friend of the shooter.

Last month, his Taliban-supporting father showed up at an event and sat just behind Clinton. He later praised her stance on gun control, an odd statement as the club Omar Mateen targeted was a gun-free zone.

"NY, NJ Bomber Rahami The Latest Terrorist To Pass FBI Investigation","“Ahmad Khan Rahami’s Father Told Police in 2014 His Son Was a Terrorist, Officials Say,” according to the New York Times.

The story says that when alleged New York and New Jersey bomber Rahami was captured, he was carrying a notebook in which he wrote of killing unbelievers. Investigators are looking into what, if any, assistance he had in carrying out his terror plot as well as his series of trips to Pakistan:

The father made the statement about his son being a terrorist to New Jersey police in 2014, when Mr. Rahami was arrested after a domestic dispute and accused of stabbing his brother.



The information was passed to the Joint Terrorism Task Force led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Newark. Officers opened what is known as an assessment, the most basic of F.B.I. investigations, and interviewed the father, who then recanted.

This is the latest example of the FBI receiving tips about terrorists prior to their acts of terror. Here are a few others of recent vintage:

Orlando : The FBI was tipped off to Omar Mateen’s radical views in 2013. They put him under surveillance and used confidential informants, but dropped the investigation. A year later he was investigated for ties to the first American suicide bomber in Syria. They dropped that investigation as well. He went on to kill 49 clubgoers and injure another 53.

The ‘Draw Muhammad’ Shooter : The FBI allegedly egged on one of the men involved in the terror attack, after previously closing a case involving making false statements to federal officials. Here’s what The Daily Beast reported: “Days before an ISIS sympathizer attacked a cartoon contest in Garland, Texas, he received a text from an undercover FBI agent. ‘Tear up Texas,’ the agent messaged Elton Simpson days before he opened fire at the Draw Muhammad event, according to an affidavit (pdf) filed in federal court Thursday.” Shortly thereafter, he and his accomplice drove to the contest and shot at police officers.

Boston Bombers : Russians told the FBI that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was an Islamist preparing to join militants. The agency investigated him but closed the probe after three months. Two years later, he and his brother wrought terror at the Boston marathon, using pressure cooker bombs.

Fort Hood Shooter: “The FBI was too concerned about political correctness and did not launch an investigation into a man who was later charged with killing 13 people in the 2009 attack in Fort Hood, Texas, despite significant warning signs that he was an Islamic extremist bent on killing civilians,” the Associated Press reported in 2012.

The FBI isn’t the only agency to have dropped the ball on investigating terrorism. Here are a few other examples.

San Bernardino Terrorists : Less than a day after a terrorist attack in which 14 people were killed and another 22 injured, the head of the San Bernardino U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office stonewalled Homeland Security agents attempting to investigate the man accused of supplying the guns and ammo in the attack. According to an Inspector General report, Irene Martin also gave inconsistent answers when speaking with the agents. The suspect was later apprehended.

Dallas Police Shooter: The Army failed to fully investigate charges of misconduct against Micah Johnson, who killed five police officers and injured another seven, and erroneously granted him an honorable discharge, CNN reported.

What are we actually getting for our homeland security spending? We spend more than $8 billion a year on the FBI, $41 billion on DHS, and $70 billion on intelligence. The bombs in New York City were found by random people on the street wanting free stuff, and curious neighbors. The New Jersey bombs were heroically discovered by homeless people rifling through garbage. The Minnesota ISIS terrorist was killed by an NRA-certified concealed carry instructor.

There are many wonderful federal employees toiling away in each of these agencies, and many committed bureaucrats and officers doing what they can to keep the country safe. At the same time, it’s worth asking if the administrative state’s handling of terror threats is worth the tremendous expense that goes with it. If not, it’s also worth asking what all needs to change.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/09/20/ny-nj-bomber-rahami-the-latest-terrorist-to-pass-fbi-investigation/,2016-09-20
It’s Deadly To Pretend ISIS Doesn’t Mean What It Says,"Over the weekend, America once again became the target of terrorism. This time it was several pipe bombs and homemade pressure cookers left in multiple locations in New York City and New Jersey. The prime suspect, Ahmad Khan Rahami, an Afghanistan-born American, was apprehended Monday morning after a shootout with police.

While Rahami’s motivations are still allegedly unknown, it appears he traveled to Afghanistan, after which friends say he appeared to have been radicalized. Just like after so many other recent Islamist terrorist attacks, there was a rush from the media and politicians to claim these attacks weren’t organized by the Islamic State (ISIS), and therefore were random events. This is not only disingenuous—it’s reckless.

On Sunday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was quick to assure people that although the blast did appear to be intentional, it was certainly not a case of “international terrorism” (Monday morning Cuomo changed his mind after Rahami was identified as the suspect). How the governor made his initial assessment so quickly isn’t clear. Why he did so is perhaps easier to grasp.

Liberal politicians and members of the media want to deny an “international” aspect because it gives them an excuse for inaction. If it’s not international, and instead just a domestic problem that’s (fingers crossed) “just random,” the government won’t have to address or change its foreign policy. It would mean ISIS isn’t actually powerful enough to reach out beyond Europe and the Middle East and strike America, and that the U.S.-led coalition fighting in Iraq and Syria is sufficient for combatting the threat.

It would also vindicate President Obama’s foreign policy of “leading from behind,” and suggest it hasn’t caused massive upheaval in the Middle East that may take decades to fix.

When Lone Wolves Become a Pack

People often employ the “lone wolf” claim to avoid acknowledging international terrorism. By Monday morning, when it became clear that several bombs had been intended to detonate and cause mass chaos, a terrorism analyst told CNN’s Carol Costello that it’s possible that “two or three lone wolves may have gotten together.” This linguistic maneuvering attempts to distract from the fact that coordination between individuals is what defines a network. As Dana Loesch noted on Twitter: “How many ‘lone wolves’ make a pack?” Multiple attacks imply an organized effort. (Later in the morning, Rahani became the primary suspect in all of the bombing attempts, and it’s not yet clear whether he had any accomplices.)

This line of argumentation has been used repeatedly after past terrorist attacks, even when there’s ample evidence that the attacker(s) pledged allegiance to ISIS (see the Orlando nightclub shooting, San Bernardino, etc.). It’s also the reason being given for a stabbing in a Minnesota mall over the weekend by a Somali-American man, Dahir Adan, who allegedly cried “allahu akbar” before attacking nine people and being shot dead by an off-duty police officer. Although ISIS claimed Adan as one of their “soldiers,” the St. Cloud, Minnesota police chief, Blair Anderson, said nothing suggests this was “anything but a lone attacker.”

The appeal of this approach is that if the attacker is just a lone wolf, not an ISIS operative, then it could simply be someone disaffected by poverty or social alienation. Rahami’s family had previously complained about discrimination in their New Jersey town, for example. Or perhaps it’s a mentally ill individual—a diagnosis that now covers all manner of sins, including religious zealotry—who just snapped.

These motivations can be attributed to political and social ills like lack of health care, gun control, or welfare, the blame for which falls conveniently on Republicans. This also makes it easier to avoid facing the threat of radical Islam, both as an international military matter and as a religious and political movement.

ISIS Explicitly Supports Attacks Like This

But whether or not an attacker has some personal issues or mental illness is ultimately immaterial to the question of whether the attack is carried out on behalf of an international terrorist organization. Even if it’s true that the person is unstable, or the victim of discrimination, the reality is that ISIS uses these people as their long arm to reach out and strike the West, which, as for all Islamists, is one of their primary strategic goals. It’s not just a reactionary move in the face of territorial defeat in the Middle East.

It’s also either naïve or deeply dishonest to say that because ISIS didn’t directly coordinate an attack, it wasn’t an ISIS attack. Inspiring adherents around the world to launch terrorist attacks on their own initiative is a vital part of ISIS’s strategy. It’s a more efficient use of time and resources if they don’t have to plan every single attack. Instead, they can rely on people devoted to ISIS and its fundamentalist interpretation of Islam. It also makes it more difficult for law enforcement to detect plots and potential terrorists.

ISIS has been explicit about this. The group has been calling on Muslims in Western countries to kill civilians by any means at least since September 2014. The group regularly publishes manuals on how to perpetrate these “homegrown” terrorist attacks, including information on building bombs, using knives, or simply running people over in a truck, like the attack in Nice, France that killed 86 people. All these methods have been successfully utilized in so-called “lone wolf” attacks in Europe and America. (It’s interesting to note that while ISIS itself uses the phrase “lone wolf,” they do so differently than Westerners, who use it to indicate an isolated event.)

To add some historical context, recall that at the end of the nineteenth century, Europe was suffering a rash of anarchist terrorist attacks. At the time, they were considered isolated and unrelated events. But in retrospect, historians like Barbara Tuckman have noted that these men and women were acting as part of a broader movement, one that worked almost like a virus spreading its radicalism to otherwise unconnected individuals. Their connection, of course, was their beliefs.

ISIS is much more overtly organized and blatant about its mission and strategy than nineteenth-century European anarchists, even if that strategy involves the illusion of disparate actors. Yet so many politicians and members of the media continue to act like the whole thing is a mystery, dots with no lines connecting them. They don’t take ISIS, or the attackers, at their word. That’s a dangerous game to play.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/09/20/pretending-isis-doesnt-mean-says-deadly/,2016-09-20
Newly Released Transcript Proves Orlando Terrorist Was Avenging ISIS,"Orlando police released the full transcripts of terrorist Omar Mateen’s phone conversations with police the night he killed 49 people and injured 53 others on June 12 at a gay nightclub in Orlando.

Throughout multiple conversations with authorities, Mateen repeatedly states he sought to kill and terrorize Americans as payback for drone strikes in Iraq that killed a key ISIS leader, Abu Waheeb, in early May.

Mateen told the negotiator that Waheeb’s death is what “set him off.” Rukmini Callamachi of The New York Times explained his fixation with Waheeb reveals how intensely interested Mateen was in the terror group, as the leader is a lesser-known figure in ISIS.

8. So who is Abu Waheeb? That's exactly the point. Waheeb is an obscure figure in ISIS, one of the original members of al-Qaeda in Iraq — Rukmini Callimachi (@rcallimachi) September 26, 2016

Mateen repeatedly told police he wanted to send a message to Americans and get them to stop aerial drone strikes against ISIS forces.

“You have to tell America to stop bombing Syria and Iraq,” Mateen said.

In another portion of the phone call, Mateen called Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev his “homeboy,” and when police asked the Orlando terrorist what his name was, he called himself an “Islamic soldier.”

Although the transcript of the initial phone call in which Mateen declared allegiance to the Islamic State was released shortly after the attack, the rest of the conversations between the terrorist and hostage negotiators on that tragic night were made public this last Friday evening. Orlando police were reportedly reticent to release the transcripts, but the FBI said the phone calls will not affect its case.

When the DOJ and FBI released the transcript for the initial 911 call in June, they censored references to Allah and the Islamic State — giving many the impression their investigation would be shaped by an apparent eagerness to memory-hole the terrorist’s true motivations.

In the days after the attack, President Obama and Attorney General Loretta Lynch tried to pretend they weren’t sure whether his Islamism motivated Mateen.

“I cannot tell you definitively that we will ever narrow it down to one motivation,” Lynch said in a press conference a few days after the attack. “People often act out of more than one motivation.”

Four days after the attack, Obama said the terrorist’s motivations were unclear.

“So whatever the motivations of the killer, whatever influences led him down the path of violence and terror, whatever propaganda he was consuming from ISIL and al Qaeda, this was an act of terrorism but it was also an act of hate,” he said.

Later in the same speech, Obama blamed the attack on the terrorist’s ability to procure a gun and Republican lawmakers who didn’t want to circumvent Americans’ Fifth Amendment right to due process. He also conflated Mateen’s actions with those of the Newton and Aurora shooters, who had no apparent or coherent ideology to speak of, and ignored the fact that Mateen repeatedly stated he was seeking to avenge ISIS in the last moments of his life.

Although the full transcript has been released, questions still remain, as portions of this call remain unclear — including a key part in which Mateen declares allegiance to ISIS.

“I pledge allegiance to (unidentifiable name) on behalf of the Islamic State,” Mateen said, according to the transcript.

"Question The Stories You Tell Yourself About Terrorism, Shootings","This last week I attended a panel discussion on Islamophobia and my Facebook friends reacted to the news that in North Carolina a black police officer had shot a black man who may have been armed. These might seem unrelated, but they were not. These experiences were really about the exact same thing: the human capacity to form narratives and hold on to them regardless of the evidence.

Let’s start with the panel. Three professors took turns speaking, concluding the narrative many Americans have developed about Arabs and Islam is not accurate. Many people fear Arabs because they’re Muslim. But there are in fact a lot of Christian, Sikh, and even agnostic Arabs.

Many people also often fear Muslims because of all the terrorist attacks. However, you are much more likely to be killed by lightning than by an Islamic extremist. According to one of the lecturers, Islamic extremism has only killed 109 Americans since September 11, 2001. That might sound like a lot, and every life is precious, but if you run the numbers, there is an infinitesimally small chance that you’ll be one of them. Many more people die falling out of bed: that kills 737 Americans annually.

This panel pointed out that often the narratives we develop are inaccurate, and need to be questioned. If we don’t question them, bad things happen—in this case, Islamophobia. Islamophobia has led to violence against Arabs, hate killings, and alienating many American citizens. Although many people struggling with Islamophobia might feel that Muslims and Arabs are attacking their way of life, destabilizing their country, and undoing the social fabric of their community, these feelings don’t make it true. But people typically continue to believe their narratives despite the evidence.

To Wake Others, We Need To Respect Them

Now, people’s feelings still matter even if they don’t reflect the truth of a situation. If people feel this way, we need to address it. We need to talk about it. We need to be open to hear their voices, and offer our own alternative interpretations respectfully, lovingly, and with an open mind.

In other words, we have to be willing to question our own narratives if we want to ask others to question theirs. We need to be open. If we’re not open, it’s very easy to become extreme. That’s the message I took away from the panel.

However, the opposite message filled my newsfeeds the day after Keith Scott was killed. A lot of my friends posted articles about how we need to shut down the hurtful narratives that oppose Black Lives matter. One article went so far as to say if you can’t promote BLM then give the mic away and let someone else speak.

I value the idea of letting someone else speak, but this was not a message of openness. It was a message of restriction, and of doubling down on a single narrative. The idea was that if you don’t agree with this message, shut up. There was no place for an alternative narrative. Of course not everyone feels this way, but apparently a lot of my friends do.

So what’s the problem with just validating someone’s narrative? If they feel that way, shouldn’t that be a good enough reason to validate it? Well, not when it comes to Islamophobia. Instead, when people feel one way, sometimes the most important and healthy response is to lovingly present an alternative narrative.

This is a basic skill for maintaining mental health. It’s the primary skill cognitive behavioral therapists teach to their patients. When people are depressed, it’s often because they have a hard time not interpreting their experiences in a singular way. When someone is anorexic, it can be the result of inaccurate stories he tells himself about food and health. When someone is paranoid, it often comes from false beliefs about the world.

It’s Time to Question Your Own Narrative

Cognitive behavioral therapy isn’t just for people with mental illness. Opening our minds to alternatives helps us all deal with things more intentionally and productively. For example, The New York Times publicized a study conducted by Roland Fryer, a black professor at Harvard University who studies methods of reducing racial achievement gaps. Fryer studied more than 1,000 shootings in 10 major police departments, in Texas, Florida, and California. He found police officers were slightly more likely to shoot white individuals than black individuals (his study of course adjusted for all those things like racial density). This surprised Fryer.

When we’re dealing with people being killed, I feel a need to say that a death is always tragic regardless of who the person is, where he is from, or what he has done in his life. Killing someone ends possibility, crushes expectations, and affects many people. Yet if we’re honest, very few people are shot and killed by police officers, and there’s a good chance race may not be a significant deciding factor.

If on average it’s not a racial issue, we can still talk about restricting lethal force, but we would need to start by finding out how much there really is. According to Fryer’s study, there were 1.6 million arrests in Houston over five years and officers only fired their weapons 507 times. That means a gun wasn’t fired during an arrest 99.97 percent of the time. So while we are all more likely to be shot by a police officer than by an Islamic extremist, you’re still pretty safe from both.

If you’re walking down the street scared that an Arab is going to kill you, you need to question your narrative. And if you’re walking down the street fearing the cops are going to shoot you, you also need to question your narrative. So why are people scared of these things? Because our brains are storytelling machines and once you’ve developed a narrative it’s very hard to doubt it. Instead, whenever another bomb goes off or another black man is shot, we add that to our bag of confirmation.

But our ability to confirm our own narratives doesn’t change the facts. The fact remains that you’re pretty safe from cops and Islamic extremists alike.

Keeping an Open Mind Helps You Stay Free

Clinging too tightly to a narrative can cause you to miss the more compelling and honest story. When Fryer allowed himself to question the pervasive narrative, he realized that while lethal force is not very common, nonlethal force is. As a result, he discovered that black people are more likely to be frisked, cuffed, pepper-sprayed, etc. than white people. Rather than reinforcing an old narrative, his openness allowed him to discover something perhaps even more crucial.

So Fryer began to focus on the ways minor acts of force might have a larger effect on black lives. By questioning his narrative, Fryer might have found something more interesting, vital, and ubiquitous. Fryer’s conclusion is that perhaps we should focus on the nonlethal stuff because that happens all the time and leads to black disillusionment.

In his own words: “Who the hell wants to have a police officer put their hand on them or yell and scream at them? It’s an awful experience. Every black man I know has had this experience. Every one of them. It is hard to believe that the world is your oyster if the police can rough you up without punishment. And when I talked to minority youth, almost every single one of them mentions lower-level uses of force as the reason why they believe the world is corrupt.”

So what did the incidents following Scott’s death and the panel discussion at North Carolina State University about Islamophobia have in common? They’re both about humans and narratives. Narratives are like ruts our brains follow. We have to be willing to step out and consider other perspectives if we want to see where we’re going. Questioning our narratives is hard and uncomfortable, and can leave us feeling anchorless. But it can also free us to sail and find new and better moorings.

How North Korea Could Fulfill Its Promise To Erase The United States,"Many people complacently ignore the threats posed by the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK)—as if it’s a fourth-world country run by a chubby, raging lunatic who needn’t be taken seriously. But those of us who keep our binoculars on North Korea (albeit from Google Earth or declassified maps) know that ignoring Kim Jong Un is an error we may not live to regret.

What kind of an attack could Kim hurl at us? One that could kill between 75 percent and 90 percent of our population, relegating Americans to endangered society status and transporting those surviving back in time to the mid-1800s—if we’re lucky.

Most people, especially those who don’t know who Kim Jong Un is, are unaware that he has a nuclear arsenal, albeit a minuscule one (38North.org, a site that closely monitors North Korea, estimates that “…a stockpile of sufficient fissile material for approximately 20 bombs by the end of this year and a capacity of adding approximately 7 per year makes the DPRK claim sound plausible”). This arsenal poses no serious threat to the U.S.

But it’s not the threat of a nuclear missile attack that concerns Dr. Peter Pry (who heads the Taskforce for National and Homeland Security, and for which I volunteer some of my time), ex-CIA director James Woolsey, Center for Security Policy Founder and President Dr. Frank Gaffney, and others who closely monitor nuclear developments in the DPRK. We are all deeply concerned about the horrendous potential for Kim Jong Un to use just one device—one which poses a threat far more devastating than a full-on Russian nuclear attack.

North Korea Wants to Wipe Out the U.S. ‘All At Once’

On September 9, the North Koreans conducted their fifth nuclear test, this one the biggest of five, registering a 5.3 on the Richter scale and estimated at 20 to 30 kilotons. In this case (as with an earlier test conducted in January), it may be difficult for our radiation sniffing-planes to pick up much fallout. The January test produced seven to 10 kilotons, yet we didn’t pick up any alarming release of radiation. Why?

Many believe it was not a conventional nuclear test for two reasons: first, both of the latest detonations were likely hydrogen-based devices, making them thermonuclear. Second, the kinetic yield (radioactivity) was sacrificed to increase gamma ray emissions.

Why is that important? Because the DPRK isn’t interested in making several of our cities glow. They want to take us out “all at once.” After the January test came this from North Korea’s news service, KCNA: “The scientists and technicians of the DPRK are in high spirit to detonate H-bombs of hundreds of Kt (kiloton) and Mt (megaton) level capable of wiping out the whole territory of the U.S. all at once…” [Emphasis added]

While that may seem like the typical bellicose, hyperbolic venom Kim Jong Un tosses our way, it’s not. This time, his saber rattling may have him tossing the sheath away. What would send us to oblivion “all at once?”

An EMP, or a Super-EMP. If you understand what an EMP is, you’re ahead of the game. Unfortunately, few in this country have the faintest idea what it is, and probably don’t care.

What’s An EMP, And What Can It Do?

EMP stands for “electromagnetic pulse,” and it is truly devastating to anything and everything that has a microchip in it or is part of the crumbling, antiquated, and hopelessly snarled convergence of wires we call our electric grid.

The grid comprises three major sections: the Eastern Interconnection, which provides the nation with 75 percent of its power; the Western Interconnection; and the Texas Interconnection, all of which hopelessly lack the kind of hardening we need to protect them.

An EMP-based weapon would do a good deal of damage. But if the last two DPRK tests involved thermonuclear devices, they could become Super-EMPs. When those are put aboard a satellite and detonated 300 miles above the center of the U.S., just one of them would impale technology addicts on a painful and sharp withdrawal spike, while tossing our urban and suburban populaces into abject panic and chaos.

As I write this, the DPRK has two satellites flying above us on a south to north trajectory. It’s the same satellite route the Soviets used during the Cold War. Back then, the prevailing wisdom was that if the Soviets to launch their nukes at us, the missiles would come over the North Pole. In response, we stationed our missile defense systems in the north. Since the Soviet Union shattered, that defensive posture has not changed, leaving no defense in the south or along the Eastern Seaboard.

While no data stream has been detected coming from either “earth-based satellite” (according to the DPRK), it is not known whether nuclear devices are aboard those satellites or whether they are “test vehicles.”

In response to those devices and one recent rocket engine test, the U.S. and U.N. have showered Kim Jong Un with sanctions that hurt members of the ruling class, including him. The North Korean people are beyond impoverished, and live with the government’s hand around their throats.

According to FoxNews.com, “Kim [Jong Un] was quoted as ordering officials and scientists to complete preparations for a satellite launch as soon as possible, amid the enemies’ [the U.S.] harsh sanctions and moves to stifle the North.”

And Joel Wit, founder of the 38 North website, notes that “This test is another important development pointing to the first launch of a bigger, better space vehicle to place satellites in higher orbits, which could happen in the not too distant future.”

Kim’s request for a satellite in higher orbit is particularly troubling: it means he could pack an EMP or Super-EMP device on it and put it into orbit over the U.S. Unless we take swift measures to “harden” our electric grid and military assets—and soon—America could become an endangered society. An EMP or Super-EMP detonated at an altitude of between 25 and 300 miles (the higher the better) would be cataclysmic.

The Apocalyptic Power of the Super-EMP

The detonation itself would not harm us physically. The kinetic energy (radiation) would dissipate harmlessly in space. The increased gamma rays, however, would race toward earth in three waves, milliseconds apart. Electrons in air molecules in our atmosphere would be knocked out by gamma rays in massive numbers that then rush earthward. Once they came in contact with the ground, they would take out transformers in substations. Hyper-electrical pulses would snake along our electric lines, destroying transmission and distribution technologies as they go.

The immediate effects would be withering: planes in flight would start falling from the skies. Chemical plants that control hazardous materials would no longer be controlled, imperiling all who live nearby as their computerized technology fails. Most cars built after 1974 would lose power. Trains, especially those operating on electrified tracks, would come to a halt. Tens of thousands would be stuck in elevators nationwide.

Planes in flight would start falling from the skies.

But the biggest long-term threat manifests as the “Rule of Threes.” We can hold our breaths for three minutes. We can go without water for three days, and without food for three weeks. City populations living in skyscraper apartment buildings would no longer get water pumped to them. Bottled water would disappear from supermarket shelves on the first day. Most submarkets are stocked for only three days worth of consumable inventory, especially meats and fresh vegetables.

Perhaps most vulnerable in the transmission and distribution system are huge transformers that are extremely hard to replace, and (as with so many other industries) no longer manufactured here. They now come from Germany and South Korea. Each is unique and designed to fit in a specific place within substations, of which nine are critical.

These transformers are complex power regulators that take a year to build and cost $10 million. They must be shipped here and off-loaded to special trucks that can accommodate them. Each one can weigh over 400 tons. A standard 18-wheeler won’t do the job. Their tires would burst. Plus, gasoline would become extremely scarce. Oil refineries would cease to function, so finding enough gas to power these huge trucks would be nigh impossible. We have some backup transformers here, but nowhere near enough to replace all of the damaged ones hit by an EMP. Estimates are that it would be at least a decade before we could replace enough transformers to get at least some electricity flowing.

Only the Preppers Will Survive

But failure of the grid presents a secondary and even more devastating effect, one that would threaten even those in the hinterlands.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, “There are 60 commercially operating nuclear power plants with 100 nuclear reactors in 30 states in the United States. Of these plants, 36 have two or more reactors.” Nuclear power plants are as dependent on power from the grid as any other energy-consuming entities. The Nuclear Regulatory Agency mandates that a one-week supply of diesel fuel be sustained at each nuclear plant to fuel the backup generators. But it’s useless if there are any computer chips running those generators. The only other possibility is to use battery backups for as long as possible. When those fail, even reactors taken offline need to be bathed constantly in cold water. Without generators or batteries to pump that water, there’s no way to cool the reactors or the spent-fuel-rod pools. Once the water boils off, it’s Fukushima times 100.

Regardless of how it’s done, few would survive an EMP attack.

All of those reactors will melt down with the spent-fuel rods. Hydrogen will build up in the tops of the reactors, as it did in Fukushima, and if ignited would cause the same explosions we saw in Japan. With the Jet Stream flowing from west to east, radioactivity would cover the nation.

Regardless of how it’s done, few would survive an EMP attack. If we were to be hit by a Super-EMP, only those who have amply prepared by having renewable water supplies and food stores will have a chance.

As a measure of how seriously this threat is taken by the military, consider that NORAD has scurried back under the protection of Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado. They are currently spending a $70 million allocation to further harden the facility.

With Kim as unpredictable as he is, we’d be wise to do all we can to convince our federal and state governments to protect our electric grid. If we fail to do so, the consequences could be cataclysmic.

The Left Has a Broken Immune System. Could Trump Fix It?,"There’s a theory in medicine that the rise in allergies and autoimmune disorders in developed countries is due, at least in part, to the cleanliness of modern life there. The idea, called the “hygiene hypothesis,” is yet unproven. But the evidence for it is substantial. As a 2010 paper in the journal Clinical and Experimental Immunology explained, the theory is that “the decreasing incidence of infections in western countries and more recently in developing countries is at the origin of the increasing incidence of both autoimmune and allergic diseases.”

Because we in the developed world have fewer childhood diseases and infections, our immune systems instead overreact to ordinary things—as in the case of allergies—or even attack the body itself, as in autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Correlation is not causation, of course, but the theory is that our immune systems evolved to deal with constant threats and do not know what to do with themselves when those threats are mostly neutralized by modern hygiene and preventative medicine.

The ‘Hygiene Hypothesis’ Fits Our Political Moment

It’s a good analogy for the current state of American politics.

When George W. Bush was president, the Left had an obvious outlet for its frustrations. Bush and his administration were conservative. If you wanted to be an activist for radical environmentalism, wealth redistribution, abortion, and other lefty causes, Bush was your target. Add to that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and protesters could find ample reason to peaceably assemble during those eight years.

Such was their right and, as they saw it, their duty. In our hygiene analogy, the Left is the immune system, protecting America from what they see as threats. In protesting the Patriot Act, for instance, some leftists wanted to protest anything that helped the War on Terror, while others were concerned with the civil rights implications of the government’s expanded surveillance powers.

Various segments of the Left spent the Bush years united on social issues. Abortion, gay marriage, the death penalty, assisted suicide, and many other issues became causes for protests. In protecting their vision of the American body politic, leftists could agree: Bush was the enemy. Their job, as they saw it, was to reject him and others on the Right the way a body rejects a pathogen.

The Left’s Immune System Fell Apart Under Obama

Then came Obama. The election of 2008 brought a leftist to the White House and gave the Democrats supermajority control of Congress, too. That election was mostly a reaction to the economic crash the same year, but it also reflected the Left’s emerging victory in the culture wars. For them, 2008 was a good year.

Their victory continues to build until the present day. Despite the fundraising hysterics from the likes of Planned Parenthood and NARAL, the legal right to an abortion is as secure as it has ever been. Likewise, thanks to the Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, gay marriage is now the law of the land in all 50 states. Enthusiasm for the death penalty is waning, as is support for the war on drugs. The culture wars are looking more and more like a victory for the Left.

At the same time, President Obama has presided over a retreat from our military responsibilities around the world. Hasty withdrawals from Afghanistan and Iraq aligned with the Left’s goals—and if they left a power vacuum that led to the rise of ISIS, well, that was someone else’s problem. At least the “Bush Lied, Kids Died” folks were starting to realize their pacifist dream. They must be thrilled, right?

Wrong. Obama’s policies could reasonably be called the most leftist in American history, but to a radical Left trained to attack traditional values, nothing is enough. As wars were winding down, they complained that we had not fully retreated to our own shores, as Obama’s bumbled intervention in Libya showed. Even the rapid growth of the gay rights revolution was not fast enough. And while Bush was a convenient target for hate from all strains of leftism, to attack the most progressive (and first non-white) President who succeeded him was unthinkable—even though he fell short of the Left’s ideal.

The Left Has Turned On Itself

The result? The Left has gone haywire. College campuses, the fomites of most intellectual illnesses, have seen the worst of it. But the effects are becoming more widespread. After the unrest of the 1960s, many liberal protesters continued their education and returned to campus as professors. Gradually, by the 1980s, the inmates had taken over the asylum. That provided for equilibrium for a time, as administration, staff, and the more left-leaning students were all on the same page.

Victory in the culture wars left social justice warriors without a battle to join.

Now, even those old radicals are considered backward by the standards of their 21st century protégés. Say what you will about the hippies, at least they believed in free speech. As the Left’s immune system began to malfunction, the Old Left’s insistence on listening to other points of view and exchanging ideas became, rather than a means of spreading ideas, a threat to the New Left’s dogma. Having defeated conservatives in the college administration and now the national administration, they had no true enemy left to fight. Tolerance itself became the foe.

Victory in the culture wars left social justice warriors without a battle to join. Gay marriage was a done deal, legally, and conservatives were forced to tolerate it. Success? Hardly. Tolerance was for the weak. Now, conservatives must be made to accept it—in hearts, minds, and speech, as well as in law. The marriage wars ended, but the wedding cake wars had just begun. The leftist immune system defeated right-wing values in much of the public sphere. Now, it turned on the insufficiently woke Left.

Social Justice Warriors Looking For a Cause

Some may have been happy to agree to disagree, but it is in the nature of a progressive to progress. They began to skip the pretense of tolerance, and went straight to forced acceptance. Disagreement is no longer an opportunity for reasoned discussion—it’s an assault. Leftists have used the metaphor of words-as-violence for so long that they now see it as literal truth.

The New Left now believes they must physically flee from words they disagree with. Did you say something everyone thought was normal 10 years ago? No, comrade, that’s a micro-aggression now. Did you use the “wrong” pronoun? That’s grounds for a Maoist struggle session. Protesters in the 1960s fled from tear gas and police dogs; their grandchildren flee from strongly worded Facebook posts.

Thus came the rise of safe spaces. Liberals once fought for integration, whether of race, of sex, or of philosophy. Now, tolerance and consorting with un-likeminded others is too taxing. They insist on commandeering a physical space from which to exclude them. The phenomenon has been covered across the media, and needs not be repeated here, except to say that it would not have happened if John McCain or Mitt Romney were president. It would not have happened if we were at war with ISIS. It would not have happened if the fight for gay marriage were being waged in state legislatures and ballot initiatives across the nation.

But the Left has already won those fights. Their political immune system has nothing to strive against, so they have intellectual allergic reactions to imagined slights and struggle against their erstwhile allies.

Could a President Trump Offer the Cure?

Progressives like to see history as following a path toward a more perfect future. If that were true, the trend on campus and in society at large would continue along its absurd trajectory. But if the hygiene hypothesis of political activism is true, the only cure for leftists will be the arrival of a real threat. Less micro-aggression and more aggression might focus their energy away from the farcical and back on the factual.

The only cure for leftists will be the arrival of a real threat.

A few weeks ago in National Review, Dan McLaughlin pondered how the Left would react to a President Donald Trump. In his telling, “[m]uch of the academic Left would treat his election as a vindication of their grim view of America; they would see themselves as offering the last safe spaces in an island of insanity, havens where they could protect their fragile-flower students from a triggering world. Campus protests would blossom like dandelions.” That would likely be their initial response, as the first few months of President Trump’s term led to further entrenchment on campus.

Things would change, however, as soon as Trump did something. Appointed a Supreme Court justice. Bombed some terrorists. Started building his fabled wall. Any of the things a Republican president might do. Anything that poses an actual threat to the Left’s vision of America would provoke the immune response that have been missing these past eight years. There would still be a few Green Party types building safe spaces against water fluoridation, or whatever the next wacky cause is, but most would remember quickly that a (sort-of) Republican now heads the executive branch and poses a true threat to the causes they hold dear.

2016 Will Offer a Remedy to the Left’s Disorders

A Trump victory seems less likely by the day, but even a Hillary Clinton presidency might see the autoimmune response diminish. Because of the vicious primary fight she had against college kids’ favorite socialist, Bernie Sanders, the radical Left will not crown Clinton with the same diadem of hope and glory that they rested on Obama’s brow.

Clinton’s close association with Wall Street and her internationalist foreign policy (which many Sanders supporters consider indistinguishable from the Bush Doctrine) will not engender the same spirit of solidarity as Obama’s tabula rasa of a public career, onto which they inscribed all their hopes and dreams. A Clinton presidency would be a relief to most on the Left, but even she would be an object of greater ire than Obama.

If this is true, it will come as a relief to the normal kids on campus, the ones more interested in learning than protesting. The allergic reactions to every politically incorrect utterance will soon fade into the background as Clinton or Trump wins the presidency. The only question is: will the remedy be worse than the disease?

How Taking Mosul From ISIS Could Cause More Terror Attacks Worldwide,"The battle to take back Mosul from ISIS began last week, and although victory is by no means certain, the possibility brings up one very important question. What will happen to all of the foreign fighters if ISIS is pushed out of the city?

European and American counterterrorism officials are worried that as ISIS loses territory, foreign fighters will abandon the group and seek to return home to Europe. Meanwhile, some U.S. officials are looking to organize an offensive to retake ISIS’s de facto capital in Raqqa, giving those fighters fleeing Mosul nowhere to regroup. It’s unlikely that coalition forces will be able to capture most of these ISIS fighters, whether Syrian, Iraqi, or foreign-born. This means that fighters from Europe might escape and try to go home.

As the coalition against ISIS moves to deprive the terrorist group of its territory, we must consider the consequences that victory could bring. The tradeoff for defeating ISIS territorially might be a spike in terrorist attacks in the West, at least in the short term. But the return of foreign Islamic State fighters to Europe could have other long-lasting effects on European civilization and the future of Islam in Europe.

Let’s Consider Several Possible Outcomes

There are several possible outcomes if ISIS is defeated in Mosul. Returning fighters may work as lone wolves, attacking in an unorganized fashion. This could take the form of small-scale attacks, like the one on the French priest over the summer. Or they could be more devastating, like the attack in Nice that killed 86 and injured more than 400.

Alternatively, these experienced fighters could take what they’ve learned over the last few years in Iraq and Syria and organize cells in Europe to carry out consistent and organized attacks, both large and small, like the coordinated attacks in Paris last November that killed 130 and wounded hundreds more.

The latter scenario has the potential to metastasize and bring enduring instability to the continent. But either one would cause panic in Europe and continue to increase the popularity of far-right nationalist political parties. This in turn would further degrade the viability of the European Union.

Another outcome that could have long-lasting effects on Europe doesn’t directly involve violence. These men (and some women) who have been fighting in Iraq and Syria may very well return to Europe without engaging in terrorism. But that means they will bring a radical form of Islam back to their mosques and communities. Rather than carrying out violent attacks, they’ll get involved with Muslim Brotherhood-sponsored Islamist groups and mosques. This would promote a strident Islamism as the preferred form of Islam in Europe, squeezing out more moderate versions of the faith.

That would affect the future of European society, potentially increasing the already tense relationship between Western liberalism and Islamic fundamentalism. A Europe with an increasing Islamist population will threaten equal rights between men and women, freedom of speech, and separation of religion and government—that is to say, some of the core tenets of Western democracy.

Returning fighters will also pass on their extremist views to their children. This has obvious generational consequences, including the continued spread of hardline Islamism in Europe. But it will also prime their children to be open to future iterations of al-Qaeda or ISIS. These groups may one day call on Muslims around the world to join them to fight in a new caliphate, or rise up to launch large-scale attacks in Europe.

Another Possibility: A Spike in Refugees

The liberation of Mosul could also result in another wave of migrants heading to Europe. The United Nations is predicting that as many of 700,000 of Mosul’s 1.2 million residents could flee the city. Some have already begun to leave in anticipation of intensified battle. While many are headed toward refugee camps, others may opt to begin life anew in a more prosperous Europe rather than wait to see which way the battle goes, especially given the concern that ISIS fighters will try to destroy as much of the city as they can, leaving citizens nothing to return to.

Residents of Mosul, a majority-Sunni city, also fear what will happen if Shiite government forces and Shiite militias take over the city. Iraqi military units already have been flying Shiite flags on army vehicles and planting them on top of newly reconquered vehicles. This indicates an uptick in sectarian tension, giving residents further incentive to leave.

The obvious security risk of another wave of refugees coming to Europe is that ISIS operatives, or simply foreign fighters wishing to return home, will camouflage themselves within these groups. This is a tactic that already proved successful during the migrant crisis in 2015. As discussed above, this would have numerous dangerous repercussions.

So What Do We Do Now?

So what can be done about this impending crisis? Coalition forces are now surrounding Mosul in an attempt to prevent ISIS fighters from escaping. Meanwhile, Turkey insists it has cut off the most widely used routes across its border with Syria, ostensibly preventing ISIS fighters from crossing into Europe.

However, counterterrorism officials in Europe are still on alert. There’s no telling what kind of unexpected turns the Battle of Mosul will take, and European fighters could find more circuitous routes home, through North Africa and across the Mediterranean.

Europe needs a plan if ISIS fighters do successfully return home to Europe. European countries have been working on de-radicalization programs for individuals who have begun down the road toward Islamist terrorism, but the success of these programs has been spotty so far. The difficulty here is that any foreign fighters who are able to get back into their country of origin will do so undetected by the government in order to avoid prosecution. Therefore, there’s no way for governments to try to de-radicalize them, because government agencies won’t even know they’ve returned.

The challenge of defeating ISIS has always been that it’s not just a territorial battle. It’s an ideological and religious one. If ISIS loses Mosul, many will defect and give up the fight. But others won’t, because they’ll still see themselves at war with the West. They’ll still believe in the supremacy of sharia and the division of the world between the dar al islam and dar al harb, the house of Islam and the house of war. As long as they hold fast to those beliefs, destroying ISIS will take a lot more than winning the Battle of Mosul.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/10/24/taking-mosul-isis-cause-terror-attacks-worldwide/,2016-10-24
13 Times Hillary Clinton Was A Truly ‘Nasty Woman’,"During last week’s presidential debate, Donald Trump called Hillary Clinton a “nasty woman,” spurring many of her surrogates and the media to lose their minds. Vox deemed the remark to be a “feminist rallying cry,” and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) took the stage at a Clinton campaign event on Monday to tell Trump that he will lose the “nasty women” vote.

The thing is, Hillary Clinton really is a nasty woman who does nasty things all the time. Don’t believe me? Here’s a list of 13 times she behaved like a nasty woman.

1. That Time She And Her Husband Funneled Haitian Relief Funds To Clinton Foundation Donors

After an earthquake devastated the island nation in 2010, the Clintons pretended to help the victims, but what happened instead is shady as hell. Let’s rewind to six years ago: Hillary is serving as secretary of State, Bill is the named the United Nations’ designated special representative in charge of its relief fund. In other words, Hillary and her husband were in complete control over how the relief funds from the United States and U.N. were spent in Haiti.

Many of the contractors who were supposed to rebuild Haiti just happened to be mega Clinton Foundation donors who ended up making sub-par dwellings many Haitians abandoned, or funneling the money to build luxury vacation homes.

Instead of rebuilding the country and saving the people from the aftermath of a devastating natural disaster, Hillary Clinton and her husband robbed them blind in order to help out their check-writing friends.

2. When She Threatened A Woman Who Accused Her Husband of Rape

Juanita Broaddrick said Bill Clinton brutally raped her in 1978 while he was running to become governor of Arkansas. Shortly afterwards, Hillary allegedly threatened Broadderick into staying silent about the ordeal — or else.

When they got there, she came directly to me and talked with me and said, ‘Bill and I are so thankful for all that you do for him.’ I was just going to say yes, and leave. She took hold of my hand. ‘Everything you do.’ And it sent chills up my spine. I thought, ‘My God, this woman knows. She knows everything.’

This isn’t the first time Hillary tried to bully a woman into keeping quiet about her husband’s serial philandering and alleged instances of sexual assault. As The Federalist reported, she has repeatedly done so in order to help herself out politically.

Clinton has long been an enabler of sexual predators and has even laughed about it. She once called Monica Lewinsky, the White House intern Hillary’s husband took advantage of during his time in the Oval Office, a ‘narcissistic loony toon.’ Kathleen Wiley, who accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault in 1993, said Hillary went out of her way to verbally beat her down in order to delegitimize the accusations.

3. When She Laughed About Getting a Rapist Off

Hillary laughed about getting a convicted rapist she was representing a super short sentence after he brutally raped a 12-year-old girl. Part of her defense strategy was to blame the victim, young Kathy Shelton, by claiming she was “mentally unstable” and had the tendency to “seek out older men.”

In audio recordings, Hillary Clinton implied she thought her client was guilty, but helped him stay in prison for less than one year anyway and laughed about it.

‘It was a fascinating case, it was a very interesting case,’ Clinton says in the recording. ‘This guy was accused of raping a 12-year-old. Course he claimed that he didn’t, and all this stuff’ . . . ‘I had him take a polygraph, which he passed – which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs,’ she added with a laugh. Clinton can also be heard laughing at several points when discussing the crime lab’s accidental destruction of DNA evidence that tied Taylor to the crime.

4. Leaving Four Americans to Die in Libya

While serving as secretary of State, she pushed a group of Americans to stay at a U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya — despite the fact that other countries were withdrawing their diplomatic staff from the region due to an increased security risks in the weeks leading up to the attack. Hillary ordered them to stay in an insecure compound and ignored nearly 600 requests for additional security from Chris Stevens, a U.S. ambassador to Libya, during the final hours of his life. She endangered their lives because she wanted Libya to be part of her diplomatic legacy when she ran for higher office.

5. All The Times She Lied About the Attack on Benghazi

In true Clinton form, Hillary lied about the real cause of the attack, radical Islamic terrorism, and instead pumped out a lie about an inflammatory video spurred riots that led to the attack. The Christian film maker who made the aforementioned YouTube video served as a pretty effective scapegoat for a while. He was sentenced to a year in prison and now lives in poverty.

Clinton’s e-mails reveal she knew the attack had nothing to do with the video all along, but spread the lie anyway. Lately, she has gone so far as to say that nobody died in Libya while she was secretary — which is another bold-faced lie.

She also likes to talk about Libya as if it’s a peaceful paradise all thanks to her. In reality, Libya has become a chaotic, murderous hotbed for ISIS. Fighters belonging to that terror group have begun to spill over into neighboring Tunisia. ISIS also has secret prisons in the region, where they torture and mangle people before finally killing them.

6. When She Called The Mom of a Benghazi Victim a Liar

Hillary actually called the mother of a Bengazi victim a liar, to cover up Hillary’s lies. In a CNN interview, Patricia Smith, the mother of Sean Smith, one of the four Americans who were killed by terrorists in Benghazi, said then-secretary Clinton lied about the circumstances surrounding her son’s death.

One month later, Clinton pilloried Smith, saying: “I can’t imagine the grief she has about losing her son. . . But she’s wrong. She’s absolutely wrong!”

Public records, however, indicate Hillary Clinton absolutely lied to the families of the Benghazi victims about the circumstances leading up to their deaths. What’s worse, she tried to make Smith seem like a deranged, grief-stricken liar in an attempt to cover her own ass.

7. When Her People Said Nasty Things About Catholics

In e-mails allegedly obtained by a hacker and published by WikiLeaks, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said some super nasty things about Catholics.

“There needs to be a Catholic Spring, in which Catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the Catholic church,” he wrote.

Clinton has yet to apologize for or repudiate these remarks. Although Hillary herself didn’t write these words, it’s alarming that she surrounds herself with people who are so hostile to religion.

8. When She Stole State Department Furniture

A former member of Hillary Clinton’s security team told the FBI she stole several pieces of furniture from the State Department for her Washington DC home. It’s unclear whether she’s returned them.

9. When She Put Human Lives at Risk for Her Own Convenience Again

While serving as secretary of State, Clinton illegally used a private, unsanctioned e-mail server that was less secure than a Gmail account and which she housed in a bathroom. She claims she did this just so she wouldn’t have to carry two devices, which is false. The vulnerabilities of the aforementioned server were so great and the information she shared on it were so secret that she put the lives of U.S. intelligence assets at risk.

10. Whenever She Was Annoying AF to Her Staff

From her e-mails, we can gather that Hillary Clinton was routinely pretty nasty to her staff. She repeatedly pestered them with dumb requests – like having them set her DVR to record “The Good Wife,” asking them how to charge an iPad, and making them fetch her iced tea.

Aaaaand let’s not forget all those times she would forward an email to her staff with the words “Pls print,” because apparently pressing the “print” button is just too much for Hillary to do herself. Talk about needy!

11. Prioritizing the Interests of Those Who Could Write Her Fat Checks above Those of Taxpayers

During her time at the State Department, Hillary spent a majority of her time with Clinton Foundation donors. It also appears Clinton delivered a speech in Morocco and pushed the U.S. government to lift an arms embargo on Bahrain in exchange for large sums of money. Her decisions, travel schedule, and even her appointment book seem to be determined by whoever could write the fattest check to her family’s slush fund rather than what was actually of interest to the American people.

12. That Time She Let An Innocent Man Be Executed

She did this in order to distract everyone from her husband’s affair. Yes, that really happened.

13. All The Times She Acts Like She’s Above The Law

Hillary Clinton was instructed to be very, very careful with sensitive information and government secrets while serving as secretary of State, but instead she was “extremely careless.”

Apparently her fast-and-loose approach to classified information rubbed off onto her staff. E-mails reveal her staff repeatedly left sensitive documents in their hotel rooms and in cars while traveling abroad. She also would repeatedly lose her Blackberry devices – which probably contained a lot of classified information.

After the news about her private server started to reach the ears of authorities, one of her State Department officials, Patrick Kennedy, tried to bribe the FBI into declassifying e-mails in order to save her from prosecution.

Bill Clinton also secretly met with Attorney General Loretta Lynch aboard a private plane on a tarmac just before the FBI and Department of Justice, which Lynch controls, announced they would not prosecute her. Hillary has allegedly said she plans to keep Lynch as U.S. attorney general — indicating there may be corruption at the root of the government’s decision not to press charges against her.

It’s also likely she used the private server to hide her secret back-room dealings during her tenure as Secretary from the public. And from what we do know about Hillary’s behavior in office, and all the secret favors she did for Clinton Foundation donors, it really does appear that corruption was her primary motivator in securing a private server.

When it comes down to it, she really doesn’t care about how her actions affect the lives of those around her. She doesn’t care if others’ lives are endangered by her decisions, as long as she can somehow benefit from it politically. She’s willing to do and say anything — threaten and gaslight rape victims, execute an innocent man, endanger lives, steal from earthquake victims, and lie about it all — in order to stay in power. It’s not sexist to say that Hillary Clinton is a nasty woman, because it’s the truth.

Russia Thinks The Cold War Is Back; Americans Aren’t Paying Attention,"Imagine Russian school children practicing putting on gas masks and transporting dummies onto stretchers. TV stations show Russian emergency workers in hazmat suits working on bomb shelters. Huge numbers of the population rehearse what to do in case of a nuclear attack. It sounds like a scene from “The Americans” or a video from Soviet-era Russia. But it’s not. This is what’s been going on in Russia in the past few weeks.

Russia is engaged in mass-scale nuclear attack preparations. Moscow is upgrading its civil defense plans, including making an inventory of all underground spaces to ensure it could shelter 100 percent of the population if a nuclear bomb hit. Current bomb shelters are being rehabbed and ventilation systems checked. Forty million Russians were involved in a drill simulating what to do in the event of a chemical or nuclear weapons strike.

This might seem surprising or unthinkable. But if you’ve been paying attention to the escalation of tensions between Russia and the United States, this fits perfectly into Russia’s intensifying belligerence and assertion of power.

It’s Been Getting Worse for Years

In the last few months, Russia’s relationship with America has begun to fray. But this mounting antagonism began much earlier, with Russia’s annexation of the Crimea and incursion in the Ukraine in 2014. Russia was testing how the West, including Europe and the United States, would react to it making land grabs in Eastern Europe. To its delight, the West did nothing. This set the stage for Russia to begin increasing its global show of force, and was a precursor to the inevitable invasion of one of the Baltic States.

Tensions further rose when Russia began fighting alongside Syrian President Bashar al Assad in the ongoing brutal civil war. Under the auspices of attacking ISIS, Russia’s air force has helped Assad pummel Syrian rebels and civilians, creating a humanitarian crisis in Aleppo. Despite numerous efforts at diplomacy by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, the diplomatic process has completely deteriorated. Adding to the chaos, after a mistaken American strike on Syrian troops, Russia threated to shoot down American planes if its troops felt threated.

As a reaction to crumbling negotiations in Syria, Russia declared earlier this month that it was withdrawing from a 2000 nuclear security agreement with the United States that called for disposing plutonium. The now-defunct treaty also required Russia not to use any plutonium for nuclear activities.

Russia is also putting its military capabilities on display. This week, Russia launched an advanced hypersonic glider warhead that is nearly undetectable to U.S. anti-missile systems. This was done in preparation of a new nuclear weapon, named “Satan 2,” that could reportedly destroy all of Texas with one strike. Putin has also moved nuclear-ready missiles to the Kaliningrad region that are capable of striking Poland and parts of Germany. In addition, last week, Russian warships heading through the English Channel toward Syria skimmed the Dover coast with machine guns aimed at the shore and fighter pilots sitting at the ready in their jets.

Russia has also been asserting itself in the realm of electronic warfare. The American government has accused Russia of interfering with the presidential election, including hacking the computers of the Democratic National Committee. There’s further fear that Russian hackers will tamper with election results. Russia’s trying to discredit our democratic system, and it seems to be working. Only 43 percent of Americans think their votes will be counted accurately in the presidential election. Donald Trump, of course, is encouraging these fears.

We’re Not Afraid of You

With these acts of hostility Russia is signaling to us, and the rest of the world, that they’re not afraid of confrontation with the West. Does this mean they’re on the cusp of starting a nuclear war? Doubtful. But they certainly mean for us to take them seriously as a major world power, and one that isn’t afraid to get its hands dirty. The nuclear attack drills fit neatly into these recent escalations. They’re Russia’s way of saying, “We’re ready. Are you?”

The answers seems to be “no.” In 2012, President Obama mocked Mitt Romney in a presidential debate for having suggested that Russia is our primary national security threat. Obama condescendingly told Romney that the 1980s were calling and they want their foreign policy back. It’s remarkable that just four years ago our president considered the idea of an aggressive Russia laughable.

Fast-forward to today, and Obama’s words seem naïve and ignorant. But it’s not clear that much has changed. Russia is resurrecting Soviet-era tactics and moving, with allies like Iran, to change the international order, and we’re still acting like they’re our partners in places like Syria.

Putin’s recent actions, especially the nuclear attack drills, could also be seen as a way to distract the Russian people from a declining economy. By whipping them up into a national security frenzy, Putin can deflect criticism about domestic policies. This is a tried and true tactic of leaders who fear losing power. Tell citizens they’re under threat of attack, and they’ll rally to the cause of their country. Their sense of national pride will soar, and so will the government’s approval ratings.

Putin is stoking national pride and anti-American sentiments to keep the loyalty of the people, and this isn’t hard to do. The Russian people already hold overwhelmingly negative views toward America and are nostalgic for the Soviet era. But just because these drills and other displays of force are being used to manipulate the Russian people doesn’t mean they don’t also represent a genuine threat to America and other NATO allies. The two scenarios aren’t mutually exclusive, as some seem to think.

While Russia is preparing for a nuclear attack and beefing up their military presence, the American people view ISIS, not Russia, as the number one threat to their country. Russia was ranked seventh—below climate change. Are Americans ready for a belligerent Russia, or do they, like Obama in 2012, scoff at the very idea?

The Russian government and its people seem to think the Cold War is back (or that it never really ended). But our own disbelief in this threat won’t change the fact that Russia aims to misbehave.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/10/31/russia-thinks-cold-war-back-americans-arent-paying-attention/,2016-10-31
Mainstream Media Don't Care About Free Speech Until Trump Attacks It,"“Our First Amendment test is here. We can’t afford to flunk it,” ran the headline of Margaret Sullivan’s column in the Washington Post on Sunday. The test, of course, is Donald Trump’s presidency, which Sullivan worries will threaten the First Amendment.

The column itself is a fine example of an emerging subgenre of post-election journalism that pretends to care about free speech now that Trump has won the White House. The great irony of these missives is that the outlets publishing them didn’t seem to care all that much during Barack Obama’s tenure in office. They were willing either to turn a blind eye to the administration’s attacks on the First Amendment, or actively cheer these on.

Sullivan quotes a column of mine from March, in which I argued that Trump doesn’t seem to understand libel laws, in part because he wants to make it easier to sue journalists and news organizations for “purposely negative and horrible and false articles.” Coming from a leading contender for the presidency, these were indeed troubling remarks at the time.

They still are. But Trump’s cavalier attitude toward free speech isn’t unique. In fact, it’s a fundamental feature of the political Left. For all its wailing about free speech in the wake of Trump’s election last week, the media spent eight years enabling and at times encouraging the Obama administration’s denigration of the First Amendment.

A Long Record Of Indifference to Free Speech

Take the free speech case par excellence, Citizens United v. FEC. The Supreme Court’s 2010 ruling prohibited the government from restricting the right of corporations to engage in free speech. Obama and the Democrats love to denounce Citizens United for allowing “dark money” to influence our elections, but recall that the case itself concerned a nonprofit that produced a documentary critical of Hillary Clinton ahead of the 2008 Democratic primary. Democrats think the federal government should be able to muzzle such a group, according to which logic there would be no reason the government couldn’t also muzzle The New York Times, CNN, or HarperCollins—or any corporation engaged in “political speech.”

Democrats, especially Obama and Clinton, have routinely called for Citizens United to be overturned. Think about that. Clinton ran for president on a platform that included amending the Constitution specifically to ban criticism of her. She’s not alone. In 2014, every Democratic member of the Senate voted to overturn Citizens United by amending the First Amendment to give Congress broad powers to suppress political speech through campaign finance reform.

Or what about Obama’s Internal Revenue Service targeting scandal? All but ignored by the liberal press and mostly forgotten amid the drama of election season, the IRS targeted more than 400 conservative groups in what will someday, one hopes, be remembered as one of the worst federal scandals in modern times—which is still ongoing, by the way.

Then there’s Obama’s national security fabulist Ben Rhodes, who crafted a false narrative about political moderation in Iran to sell a gullible press on the administration’s unpopular and unworkable Iran nuclear deal.

In that March column of mine Sullivan quoted, I referenced Cuba, where libel is “whatever the regime says it is.” But she failed to quote the full sentence, which notes that Obama held a press junket during his visit to Cuba that week—a visit the mainstream media largely celebrated. Few publications noted that, for the sake of a photo op with Cuban strongman Raúl Castro, Obama was willing to stage, without irony, a press event in a country that routinely imprisons journalists.

The list goes on and on. Yet here’s Politico’s Jack Shafer, clutching his pearls and worrying that, heaven forfend, Trump’s White House might coordinate with Breitbart, “functioning as his ministry of information as it did during the campaign, and going on the attack to keep renegade legislators in line.” This, in a publication whose chief political correspondent, Glenn Thrush, sent stories to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta for approval, imploring him, “Please don’t share or tell anyone I did this.”

The Left Has a First Amendment Problem

The problem here is not just the liberal media’s blatant collusion with the Obama administration and the Clinton campaign, but the broader posture of the political Left toward free speech. When mainstream media outlets collectively applaud the boycott of a rural pizza parlor, or the ruination of Brendan Eich, or the persecution of florists and bakers and elderly nuns who hold disfavored political views, it sends a strong message that freedom of speech doesn’t mean anything.

On college campuses across the country, liberal professors encourage their students to boycott and protest conservative speakers, shout down administrators who dare to challenge them, and segregate themselves from anyone who might have a different view. Couched in the language of “safe spaces” and “trigger warnings,” the Left’s enforcement of political correctness has created a climate of intolerance that goes beyond the campus. Even now, those protesting the legitimate outcome of a national election are in effect railing against the exercise of free speech at the ballot box.

Trump’s election is a rebuke of all that. Americans across the political spectrum are tired of political and media elites telling them what they’re allowed to say and think, dictating which ideas and opinions are permissible in polite society.

For the mainstream press to wring their hands now, after years of carrying water for Democrats who don’t care about the First Amendment, strains credulity. Most Americans know the media have been complicit in the Left’s attacks on free speech, which is one reason Americans’ trust in them has now sank to an historic low.

They also know that the media care far more about freedom of the press than freedom of speech. If they were so concerned about the First Amendment, they would have to concede that Clinton posed as much of a threat to the speech of ordinary Americans as Trump does to the speech of journalists.

We should of course be vigilant during Trump’s tenure in office, and criticize any efforts to silence the press, deny access, or otherwise trample on the First Amendment. Given his past statements and touchy temperament, there’s reason to believe Trump might indeed be hostile to critical news coverage.

But let’s not pretend we haven’t been living through a period of hostility to free speech. If the media are worried about that now, it’s only because it will be more difficult under the Trump administration to manipulate and control the narrative—a professional perk to which the Washington press corps has become all too accustomed.

Americans Will Accept Muslims Once They Have No Special Privileges,"In the wake of an increasing number of terrorist attacks in the West, many have worried what effect Muslim migrants and refugees—especially those from Syria—might have on America. Trump’s campaign promised a ban on Muslims and “extreme vetting” of immigrants in response to these concerns. And last week in The Weekly Standard, Reuel Marc Gerecht made an effort to reassure us that there is little to fear from Muslim immigration.

But Gerecht offered little evidence to support his claim that America is well suited “to absorb” Muslim immigrants. He ignored the threats of Islamism, and failed to see what Americans are mostly worried about. Terrorism isn’t the primary problem with mass Muslim immigration—political correctness is. Americans don’t fear being blown up; they fear being shut down.

Americans Are Tired of Being Told What To Say and Think

Gerecht writes that in light of Trump’s “Muslim-suspicious histrionics,” conservatives who have concerns about Muslim immigration “look like troglodytes.” While he’s right that Trump’s over-the-top comments make any discussion of Muslim immigration more difficult, Gerecht doesn’t bother to contradict this implicitly racist image of conservatives.

He therefore misses something essential in the American people’s wariness about Muslim immigration—something that has less to do with bigotry, racism, or ignorance, and more to do with our heavy-handed politically correct culture.

Trump’s win, especially among the white working class, demonstrated that many Americans are sick of the Left telling them what they are or are not allowed to say and think. Pressure from the media, academia, and Twitter-sphere to march in lockstep with progressive dogma has reached a fever pitch. Many Americans have had enough.

The Left doesn’t just want us to tolerate one another, they want approval. This is exactly what they’ve done with the transgender debate: it’s not enough for people to co-exist with America’s small transgender community, accommodating trans men and women on an individual basis. We must actively accept transgenderism by allowing bathroom assignations that many find wrong, dangerous, or unnecessary.

We Can’t Ignore Islamism When Terrorist Attacks Happen

Because Muslims have become, like the trans community, a favorite constituency of the Left, Americans understandably have a similar concern when it comes to Muslim immigration. People are increasingly worried that as America’s Muslim population rises, so too will the Left’s restrictions on what can and can’t be said about Islam. Americans don’t want to be told that something unacceptable for non-Muslims is okay for Muslims, because it’s “part of their culture.” You can’t even mention Islam after a Muslim launches a terrorist attack without being called Islamaphobic.

What’s worse, our intelligence community has been discouraged from using Islamic terms like jihad, sharia, etc. in their training materials for fear of offending the Muslim-American community. It’s no wonder there’s uneasiness with increasing Muslim immigration. People aren’t so much afraid of terrorism; they are afraid that if terrorism occurs, nothing will be done about it—and those who dare to say something about it will be shunned, or worse.

Americans need to be reassured that when attacks occur, we will have a national discussion about the prevalence of Islamism in America, the problems of Saudi funding of mosques, and the need to purge the U.S. of Muslim Brotherhood organizations. But these perfectly valid topics are increasingly off-limits.

We Shouldn’t Overlook the Quiet Dangers of Islamist Groups

But Gerecht ignores these things. He writes as though the only threat from Muslim immigrants is violent jihad. He dismissed the dangers of Islamism. Recall that Islamism is an anti-Western political and religious ideology that seeks to enforce a strict interpretation of Islamic law through the state.

When it comes to Saudi-funded Mosques, he acknowledges that this is “never good,” but that at least it’s not as bad as in Europe. That’s all he had to say about that.

Like so many others, Gerecht thinks that if a Muslim group is not launching attacks themselves, they don’t represent a threat. This discounts one of the missions of Islamism, which is to change the West from within—without violence. His comments on the Muslim Brotherhood, an organization with deep Islamist roots and strong ties to Hamas, are especially shocking:

“Much of the American right appears to believe that the Brotherhood remains evil incarnate, hence the widespread approval among Republicans of Egyptian general Abdel Fattah el-Sissi’s coup against the democratically elected Muslim Brotherhood president and parliament. If the Brotherhood were so instrumental in the generation of contemporary jihadism—and there is no denying the organization’s historical role in making Islamism, with all its anti-Western, anti-Jewish, and anti-Christian bigotry, mainstream—why haven’t members of the Brotherhood been in the frontline of taking the war to the West?”

This is a complete misread of the Muslim Brotherhood. It mistakenly pretends that jihad is the only danger there is to American society. And while the Brotherhood may speak out against violence publicly, this is strategic—what Muslims have for centuries called “taqiyya,” which means dissimulation by silence or omission.

Radical Muslims are playing a long game. They know that in America, for instance, you attract more flies with honey. Openly defending violence will get them nowhere when it comes to infiltrating and changing our society from within.

Additionally, Gerecht disregards the numerous Muslim Brotherhood-related organizations in the U.S. that have raised money on behalf of Hamas, a decidedly violent group. Even though he admits that the Brotherhood “may be vile, and are always illiberal,” he still maintains that they are “a conservative force trying to construct democratically more religious countries.” According to him, “that’s the polar opposite of the jihadism that has drawn Westernized Muslims to wage war against the Occident.”

Gerecht wants to bring us to a conclusion by way of a false premise: Violent jihad is the only thing to fear from fundamentalist Muslims. The Muslim Brotherhood isn’t violent. Therefore, American conservatives have nothing to fear from the Muslim Brotherhood. He further notes that, “not a single holy warrior who has struck the United States or Europe was a member of al-Ikhwan al-Muslimun, the Muslim Brotherhood…”

But many of these “warriors” attended mosques that are heavily influenced (and funded) by Brotherhood doctrine and the writings of Brotherhood leader Sayyid Qutb. Overlooking this connection seems either naïve or intentional.

America Should Embrace Muslims—But Not This Way

The title of Gerecht’s article implies he’s going to praise American principles of equality and democracy as reasons why “our civilization can transform [Muslims].” But in reality, he gives very few explanations for why we should be hopeful about Muslim immigration to America. Those he does give are remarkably thin, like the brief anecdote about his son’s Muslim nanny marrying a Republican, or the fact that Europe is probably going to be okay (despite the uptick in attacks in the last year) and so we are, too. That’s unfortunate, because there are legitimate reasons to think Muslims could and should be woven into the fabric of our country, but Gerecht doesn’t discuss them.

The truth is, America tends to attract a self-selecting group of Muslims from around the world, who want to live in the West and accommodate their religious practices to the tenets of a free democracy. Gerecht is right that we aren’t doing what’s necessary to make Muslims in America “a key to a victory over jihadism”—but not in the way he thinks. In fact, he has perfectly demonstrated what we’re doing wrong.

We need to address the problems, not just of violent jihad, but of Islamism in America—something he fails to do. This includes mosques that are funded by the Saudis, who have worked for decades with the Muslim Brotherhood to influence the American-Muslim community. Rather than legitimizing Islamist groups like Center for American-Islamic Relations by letting them speak for the American-Muslim community and advise our government officials, we should shun them. This would allow room for other, more moderate groups to step forward.

Political Correctness Won’t Resolve This Issue

We also need to stop condemning individuals who question the relationship between Islamism and violence, or express uneasiness about Muslim beliefs that contradict American principles of equality and free speech.

Last week, we saw what happens when you spend years telling a large swath of the country that they’re wrong-headed and bigoted at every turn. If we want Americans to accept Muslim immigration as part of the American project, we need to assure them that Muslims will be treated just like everyone else. That means no one in America gets a free pass, and political correctness won’t trump Americans’ right to voice their concerns, however unfounded Gerecht believes them to be.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/11/17/americans-will-accept-islam-once-the-left-stops-giving-it-special-privileges/,2016-11-17
Progressives Demand Gun Control After Knife Attack At Ohio State,"Progressives used a brutal knife attack at Ohio State University (OSU) on Monday as an excuse to demand more gun control, even after authorities declared that they had no evidence the attacker even used a gun during his rampage.

The attacker reportedly struck pedestrians with his vehicle and proceeded to stab several others, harming at least nine individuals, one of whom is in critical condition. Despite OSU’s initial tweets stating there was an active shooter on campus, authorities later said there was no evidence that the attacker used a gun during his attack. The victims are being treated for stab wounds and injuries sustained from being struck by the attacker’s vehicle.

An OSU police officer shot and killed the machete-wielding attacker, believed to be an immigrant from Somalia, the university’s public safety director said in a statement, according to WNYC.

Even though there is currently no evidence a gun was used by the attacker, and even though a good guy with a gun was solely responsible for ending the attacker’s rampage, various progressive activists, celebrities, and journalists spent the morning using the attack as a pretext for demanding even stricter gun control laws.

Top Terrorist: George W. Bush Stopped Us From Attacking Again After 9/11,"The mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 Americans said George W. Bush’s tenacity prevented al-Qaeda from launching another wave of attacks.

In a new memoir by James E. Mitchell, the man who developed enhanced interrogation techniques the CIA used to glean information from terrorists under then-president Bush, Mitchell divulges the details of his conversations with Khalid Sheik Mohammed (KSM), the mastermind behind 9/11.

The book, entitled “Enhanced Interrogation: Inside the Minds and Motives of the Islamic Terrorists Trying To Destroy America,” offers a “first-person account of the EIT program” where Mitchell takes the reader “inside the secretive ‘black sites’ and cells of terrorists and terror suspects where he personally applied enhanced interrogation techniques.”

The Washington Post‘s Mark A. Thiessen writes that Bush’s decision to hunt down those responsible for the attack stunned terror cells into not launching another large-scale attack, according to Mitchell’s book.

Far from trying to draw us in, KSM said that al-Qaeda expected the United States to respond to 9/11 as we had the 1983 bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut — when, KSM told Mitchell, the United States ‘turned tail and ran.’ ‘Then he looked at me and said, ‘How was I supposed to know that cowboy George Bush would announce he wanted us ‘dead or alive’ and then invade Afghanistan to hunt us down?’’ Mitchell writes. ‘KSM explained that if the United States had treated 9/11 like a law enforcement matter, he would have had time to launch a second wave of attacks.’ He was not able to do so because al-Qaeda was stunned ‘by the ferocity and swiftness of George W. Bush’s response.’

Further in Thiessen’s book review, he writes that KSM said jihadi-sympathizers will begin to immigrate to the United States and carry out small-scale attacks until Americans become weary and simply give up.

KSM explained that large-scale attacks such as 9/11 were ‘nice, but not necessary’ and that a series of ‘low-tech attacks could bring down America the same way ‘enough disease-infected fleas can fell an elephant.’ ’ KSM ‘said jihadi-minded brothers would immigrate into the United States’ and ‘wrap themselves in America’s rights and laws’ until they were strong enough to rise up and attack us. ‘He said the brothers would relentlessly continue their attacks and the American people would eventually become so tired, so frightened, and so weary of war that they would just want it to end.’ ‘Eventually,’ KSM said, ‘America will expose her neck for us to slaughter.’

KSM’s words seem almost prophetic, as there has been a significant uptick in the number of lone-wolf terrorist attacks carried out by jihadi sympathizers or self-proclaimed ISIS fighters.

“America may not be in a religious war with him, but he and other True Muslims are in a religious war with America,” KSM said. “He and his brothers will not stop until the entire world lives under Sharia law.”

"Since Berlin’s Terrorist Is At Large, Will We Finally Start To Tag Islamism?","It happened again. After a reprieve from the nearly weekly incidences of Islamist terror attacks in the West this year, there’s been another. Just six days before Christmas, a man drove a semi-truck into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin’s historic downtown. Twelve people died and dozens are injured. While Germany was victim to three smaller-scale terrorist attacks over the summer, this is the first large-scale attack that’s been successfully executed.

ISIS claimed responsibility, referring to the attacker(s) as a “soldier of the Islamic State,” as they often do when an ISIS sympathizer carries out an attack in the West. But this time something is different. Not only did the attacker not die in the aftermath, he’s nowhere to be found.

Germany officials initially arrested and held a Pakistani man who sought asylum in Germany earlier this year. But Tuesday evening he was released and authorities announced that the real culprit was still at large. They suggested there may be more than one man involved, as is often the case.

This leaves open the possibility that the unknown attacker will strike again, buoyed by his “success” in once again causing misery and fear in Europe. But this unique situation also allows for the attacker to speak out about his motivations, something previous perpetrators of Islamist terrorism have been unable to do. In fact, because attackers are often killed during the assault, Western media spends days, sometimes weeks, agonizing over possible motives other than religion.

Maybe with the attacker still alive, he can help convince the West that his was an act motivated by religious and political zealotry—not insanity, poverty, or a poor education.

We Hate the West and We Don’t Need Guns to Hit It

The Berlin attack echoed the devastating Nice terrorist attack back in July. Recall that a Tunisian man drove a truck onto the famous Nice promenade on Bastille Day during a fireworks display, killing 86 and injuring hundreds more. This week’s attack teaches us once again, and ever so sadly, that guns, bombs, or even extensive planning aren’t necessary for one man to wreak havoc on a city, country, and countless families. Where there’s a will, there’s a way. As the last two years have also shown us, there is certainly a resolve among certain Muslim sects to teach the West a violent lesson.

The symbolic selection of a Christmas market is particularly tragic, although not surprising. Christmas markets have topped the list of known potential targets in Germany since the recent ISIS-sponsored and -inspired attacks began hitting Europe early in 2015 with the Charlie Hebdo attack. In fact, it was only a few weeks ago that 12-year-old German-Iraqi tried and failed to detonate a nail bomb at a Christmas market elsewhere in Germany.

These Christmas markets are an attractive target not only because they tend to be bustling with innocent bystanders, but because Christmas is the West’s most cherished holiday and a religious occasion for its large Christian community. The Berlin attack, in other words, was meant to strike at the heart of Western culture.

The attack comes at a particularly bad time for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is up for reelection next year and has faced intense criticism over her “open arms” migrant policy during the refugee crisis that began last year. Merkel’s party, the Christian Democratic Union, is worried that the populist wave that has struck countries around the world, including the United States, is coming for Germany next.

The right-wing Alternative for Germany party, which runs on an anti-migrant platform, has already done well in regional elections this year, including in Merkel’s home district. The party’s leader, Frauke Petry, used this latest attack to illustrate the dangers of unregulated immigration, warning that Germany is “no longer safe.” She also said saying so ought to be the job of the chancellor.

Looking Away Can Be Deadly

One surprising thing about the first 24 hours after the Berlin attack was the relatively light media coverage, especially compared to when attacks like this were first starting to occur last year. Is this a new reality that Europe’s just willing to accept? Every few weeks or months a man or woman will kill randomly, sometimes on a small scale, sometimes on a large one, and we’ll just shake our heads and mumble “too bad?”

Are we done putting flag filters over our Facebook profile pictures as a symbol of solidarity, ineffectual as it might be? Or is it only in the United States that these attacks have lost their “excitement?” Are we just too distracted by Donald Trump’s latest cabinet appointment to bother ourselves with another act of terrorism across the pond?

But Europe doesn’t have the luxury of ignoring this. The problem can’t be kicked down the road. It’s lying at their feet and it isn’t going anywhere. Will they accept it as the new normal, or fight to change course?

Berlin is a reminder that the effects of the Islamic State and the refugee crisis stemming from the Syrian civil war will be felt in Europe for years to come. There are surely many more terrorist cells than we know about that infiltrated Europe disguising themselves as refugees. And then there’s the problem of European ISIS fighters who, once they are driven from Syria and Iraq, will come back home and start families and join mosques.

Both types will spread their fundamentalist version of Islam and all its attendant sanctioning of violence. Hopefully we won’t be too cynical or bored by then to care.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/12/21/since-berlins-terrorist-large-will-finally-start-believe-islamic-connection/,2016-12-21
U.S. Nuclear Response Procedure Explained Using GIFs From 'Friends',"Apparently, Donald Trump recently had a meeting with some senior military officers that included discussion of nuclear weapons, leading the president-elect to tweet that the United States needs to “expand its nuclear capability.”

Since I am an actual expert on nuclear strategy — well, if defined by years of teaching and writing about it, anyway — I started getting a lot of questions about how nuclear weapons are used. Some of these were the understandable questions of curious citizens, some were a little more panicky. I sent out links to some quickly readable articles I’ve done on the subject, primers on both U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear weapons. Still, as often happens on Twitter, I was repeating myself a bit.

So I decided to explain nuclear procedures using gifs. I started with an alarmed Joey from “Friends,” which led Sonny Bunch of the Washington Free Beacon to challenge me to explain everything using only gifs from “Friends.”

Challenge accepted.

Let us assume, for the sake of this exercise, that a crisis has gotten out of control, and that Washington is responding to an imminent nuclear attack on the United States. (If we were to use nuclear weapons first — a right we still reserve — nothing would be much different, at least in terms of the process.) Here’s what happens.

Let me try to explain the nuclear procedure with gifs.

First, the President is warned of an enemy launch. pic.twitter.com/8iGbDR9dgx — Tom Nichols (@RadioFreeTom) December 22, 2016

At this point, it is likely the president’s advisors, including the secretary of Defense, are already nearby. They will seek a decision from the president, the only person in the United States authorized to release nuclear weapons.

The president must decide whether to retaliate. Time is short. He can decide to launch American weapons out from under the attack, or he can choose to “ride out” the attack and launch what’s left after making an assessment. Either way, he has only minutes to decide. Assuming he wishes to retaliate, he must use the codes that are his alone, chose an attack option, and then direct the secretary of Defense to verify his order to waiting U.S. nuclear forces.

This order is then sent to the chain of command, including the Joint Chiefs and the U.S. Strategic Command.

Each component of America’s nuclear forces that receives this order will then verify that they have a real, legitimate order, and then they will proceed to execute the options the president has selected.

There is no countermanding this except by the same process that started it — that is, by the president. The process is built for speed, reliability, and efficiency, not for second-guessing and delay.

Soon thereafter, likely within minutes, the enemy strike arrives. The president, if not already in a secure location, is moved to safety (insofar as is possible) along with other top officials. Whatever’s left of the U.S. deterrent heads out to hit whatever was in the plan that was activated.

If this was a limited strike — that is, if there is anything or anyone left — our forces will report back their condition and try to assess damage of both the enemy’s strikes and our own.

What happens next depends on whether there’s a cease-fire and attempt to negotiate. (It will also depend on whether each side’s leaders are in any condition to communicate with each other.)

If there is no cease-fire, or if one or the other side decides on all-out war, there may no meaningful “victory,” but each combatant might try to destroy as much of the other as possible to delay the enemy’s postwar recovery for as long as possible.

If that happens, as President John F. Kennedy once warned, Americans will not be able to count on the instruments of government and will be on their own. We will all head for the cellar and stay there for a long time.

And then we’re all dead. The End. pic.twitter.com/094LiKgB2V — Tom Nichols (@RadioFreeTom) December 22, 2016

2016’s Top 10 Foreign Policy Events That Will Hit Team Trump In 2017,"2016 has been a long year. There was a presidential election we thought would never end. The political correctness war, replete with transgender bathroom debates and campus unrest, rages on.

But it’s also been a long year on the foreign policy front. So long, in fact, it can be hard to recall all that’s happened and why it’s important. As we close out the year and prepare for the incoming Trump administration, here are the top ten foreign policy developments of 2016 that will set the scene for 2017.

1. The Syrian Civil War

This year saw the Syrian civil war, which began in 2011, reach an apex of violence and death with more than half a million people dead and many more displaced. The Syrian regime took back the rebel-held eastern portion of Aleppo earlier this month after continual bombing of civilians and hospitals. Meanwhile, the international community, including the United States, watched and did nothing.

The war isn’t over, but the rebels have suffered a mortal blow in Aleppo, and Syrian president Bashir al-Assad will retain power in Syria with an iron grip. The Syrian civil war’s greatest legacy, however, will not be the reign of Assad but the retreat of America from the Middle East.

2. Russia Became a New Superpower in the Middle East

Russia emerged this year as a new superpower in the Middle East, showcasing its regional dominance by allying with Assad. Under the guise of fighting ISIS in Syria, Russia helped Assad bring the Syrian rebels to their knees at a great cost of human life. While they were barrel-bombing civilians, Russian diplomats kept U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry distracted with endless talks and ceasefire agreements that were destined to be broken.

Under President Obama’s leadership, America has been replaced by a much more nefarious power in the region. Russia’s goal in Syria was never to defeat ISIS. It was to show America’s enemies how empty our threats are, and our allies how useless our promises. In this, Moscow has succeeded.

3. The Iran Deal Went Live, Immediately Began to Crumble

At the beginning of 2016, the infamous Iran nuclear deal came into effect. The agreement between the international community and the Islamic Republic was lauded by the Obama administration and their “echo chamber” of liberal media and nuclear experts, who praised the deal as a landmark step toward preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons. Sceptics were guaranteed “inspections anytime” to ensure Iran doesn’t enrich uranium at a military grade.

But once the deal was made it became clear that this crucial aspect of accountability was just as much a lie as Obama’s promise that “if you like your health insurance, you can keep it.” Not surprisingly, the Iran deal has already begun to crack up, with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani ordering the development of nuclear-powered ships that will most likely surpass the uranium grade permitted by the deal.

4. ISIS Faces Territorial Threats in Mosul and Beyond

In October, the battle began to take Mosul back from ISIS control. A coalition of Iraqi security forces, Shia militia, and Kurdish fighters began systematically clearing the outskirts of Iraq’s second-largest city with the help of the U.S. military. Successful in the outlying cities, the battle within Mosul is slow-going and arduous. While ISIS is losing territory both in Iraq and in its strongholds in Libya, it is by no means finished.

5. ISIS Had a ‘Successful’ Year for Terrorism

The Islamic State had a successful year of terrorizing the West, whether directly or by inspiring radicalized young men. 2016’s list of terror attacks includes the bombing of the airport and a metro line in Brussels in March, the Orlando nightclub shooting in June, the horrific Nice truck attack in July, and the recent truck attack on a Christmas market in Berlin.

In addition to these large-scale attacks were a series of smaller attacks, including the murder of an 84-year old French priest, an axe attack on a train in Germany, and an attempted bombing outside a German concert venue. ISIS might be facing the threat of territorial defeat in the Middle East, but they are still able to inspire, plan, and carry out terrorist attacks in the West.

6. Europe’s Migrant Crisis and Rise of the Far-Right

This, of course, has strong links to the migrant crisis in Europe, where there is ongoing concern about ISIS operatives disguising themselves as refugees. In the first three quarters of the year, 951,140 non-European Union migrants applied for asylum for the first time. The top three countries of origin were Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq. There is additional fear that many of these refugees are adherents to strict interpretations of Islam and are therefore susceptible to radicalization.

Europe has been struggling with how to balance taking in refugees from the Middle East with providing an acceptable level of security. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has maintained a strict open-arms policy amid growing criticism after terrorist attacks on German soil this year. The migrant debate and the suggested refugee quotas from the European Union have helped drive the rise of far-right political parties throughout Europe.

Seen by many as anti-immigrant, these political parties, from Hungary to Austria to France, are self-professed nationalists who want to preserve their ethno-cultural heritage. They also want to reestablish national sovereignty and weaken the authority of the EU. Beginning with Brexit in July, this wave of populism has fueled fears of the dissolution of the EU and an end to the post-World War II European order.

7. Russian Aggression in Eastern Europe

Russia has also been busy insinuating itself throughout the European continent. This fall, Russia moved its nuclear-capable Iskander weapons into their enclave, Kaliningrad, situated between NATO members Lithuania and Poland. Russia also unveiled its newest missile, the “Satan 2,” that’s reportedly capable of wiping out an area the size of France or Texas. It’s clear that Russian President Vladimir Putin intends to test NATO’s resolve and the Trump administration’s commitment to that long-standing treaty.

8. Turkey’s Coup, Crackdown, and Shift from Western Allies

In July, a coup attempt in Turkey resulted in a prolonged state of emergency and the arrest of 41,000 alleged co-conspirators. In a claim that strains credulity, President Recep Erdogan blamed the failed takeover, as well as the December assassination of the Russian ambassador to Turkey, on a cleric living in the Poconos in Pennsylvania, placing a strain on U.S.-Turkish relations.

The coup was followed by a crackdown on journalists, dissenters, and many of Erdogan’s political opponents, leading some to suspect that the coup may have been staged, a “false flag” to justify Erdogan’s consolidation of power. Regardless, Turkey is moving away from democracy and its Western alliances and toward Islamism and stronger ties with Russia. This shift threatens to upend longstanding strategic cooperation between the West and Turkey, which until recently was an important key to maintaining relative peace in the Middle East.

9. Obama’s Pivot Toward Cuba

Obama made headlines in March by being the first sitting U.S. president to visit Cuba since Calvin Coolidge. After having led the effort toward thawing relations with Cuba in 2015, Obama legitimized the brutal communist regime not only by visiting the island, but also by holding a mockery of a press conference with dictator Raul Castro before a national press corps that’s under the thumb of the communist regime. Ignoring the ongoing human rights violations of Cuba, Obama prioritized his own “legacy.”

Later in the year, Cuban dictator Fidel Castro died. Cuban dissidents rejoiced while many in the liberal media mourned. The Cuban people now find themselves living in strange times. The island is opened to American tourists and some business for the first time in more than 50 years, while Raul Castro’s boot print is still firmly planted on their faces.

10. The Rising Threat of China

Last but not least—and likely most important in the long run—is the growing aggression of China. The People’s Republic of China has continued its territorial ambitions in the South China Sea, taking control of islands claimed by other nations as well as constructing man-made islands to establish a military presence in the area. The PRC’s move infringes on the territorial rights of other nations and threatens international shipping lanes, but it also risks military confrontation. The build-up continued this week when China sailed its first aircraft carrier and five other warships into a contested area. In a further sign that the PRC means to make its territorial claims permanent, last week it began daily civil charter flights to one of the disputed islands.

2016 has been a year of foreign policy unrest. In the wake of Obama’s strategy of withdrawal from foreign engagement, the international order has shifted. Old powers like Russia are rearing their head. Old enemies like Iran are gaining legitimacy. China is rising. The established political equilibrium in Europe is cracking. And Islamist terrorism is becoming mundane. This is the foreign policy landscape that President-elect Trump and his national security team will face on January 20.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/12/29/2016s-top-10-foreign-policy-events-will-hit-team-trump-2017/,2016-12-29
Shut Down America’s Refugees Programs Before They Replicate Germany,"On the first day of the new year, Islamic terrorists claimed another 39 victims, including Americans, in an attack at a popular nightclub in Istanbul, Turkey. The Christmas truck attack in Berlin recalls the similar July attack in Nice, France. The suspect, Tunisian asylum seeker Anis Amri, was killed in a shootout with Italian police on December 23.

Amri had been denied asylum in Germany due to his terror risk, but was not deported because Tunisia would not accept him since he lacked a passport. Amri carried six different aliases from three nations and had been monitored by German authorities. He was not a “lone jihadist” but part of an ISIS cell, and traveled covertly, like some of the Paris killers, with the refugee flow from the Mediterranean.

On the same day as the Berlin attack, there was a knife attack at a Virginia Metro station by an African Muslim, Ali Ahmed Mohamound. A similar knife attack occurred in New York City the day before, with the suspect still at large.

All this followed on the heels of November’s Ohio State knife attack by Somali Muslim refugee Abdul Artan. These attacks typify the kinds recommended in ISIS literature, and ISIS claims credit for most of them. With Berlin, Brussels, Orlando, and so many other horrific attacks this year, San Bernardino and Paris almost seem like old news.

Although we view these events with horror and growing alarm, the outgoing Obama administration is literally importing terrorists through our nation’s refugee programs. Because private contractors are paid by the head to resettle refugees and other needy populations, the resettlement program has built-in incentives for uncontrolled growth. This harmonizes with the Left’s open borders agenda, which seeks to swell the rolls of new Democrat voters while weakening the influence of traditional (read conservative) America.

Big business shares this agenda in seeking cheap, subsidized labor. The resulting bipartisan alliance has long subsidized a resettlement industry that is expensive, secretive, duplicitous, and unconcerned about the Americans who pay for it with hard-earned tax dollars. The refugee resettlement program must be abolished in its current form before it puts us on the path toward today’s turbulent France and Germany.

The Real Risk of Increasing Terrorism

The most important risk the current refugee program creates is terrorism. Since 9/11 there have been 580 convictions for terrorism in the United States. At least 40 of these were refugees. Just this year, in addition to the knife attacks by Abdul Artan and Ali Mohamound, four other refugees have committed or attempted to commit acts of terrorism.

Since March 2014 there have been 111 ISIS-related arrests and 60 convictions. There have been nine indictments and six convictions of ISIS supporters in the metropolitan DC area alone. ISIS openly encourages “lone jihadi” attacks, and the State Department now admits ISIS is trying to penetrate the U.S. refugee flow. Some 250 U.S. Muslims from 19 states have either joined or attempted to join ISIS overseas. Many have since returned with little or no oversight.

Let’s be clear: these are not Mennonite terrorists. They are not Episcopalian suicide bombers. Virtually all 580 convictions since 9/11 were Muslim immigrants or American Muslim converts, and the Somali community consistently supplies such malefactors. Yet the Department of Homeland Security has provided tours of airport facilities to groups of Somalis, including explanations of airport inner workings, security protocols, and databases. DHS redacted some of this information as too sensitive to share with the public.

The Refugee Program Is Home to Major Fraud

Virginia knife attacker Ali Mohamound was carrying multiple identities when arrested. The Ohio State terrorist and his family lived in Pakistan for seven years before being resettled to the United States. Why were they not simply resettled in Pakistan? Afghani refugee Ahmad Rahami, the terrorist bomber of New York and New Jersey, originally entered the United States through the asylum program, but then traveled back to Afghanistan, where he apparently became radicalized. How can someone who is supposedly fleeing his home country for his life go back for a visit?

Virtually all U.S. Somalis originally arrived as refugees or asylum seekers or are their children. Many now take months-long trips back to Somalia, contradicting their purported reason for seeking asylum: fleeing Somalia for their lives. Minneapolis actually grants rent relief because Somalis complained about the cost of overdue rent upon their return. The home country visits so many “refugees” make undercut the program’s integrity.

The entire refugee resettlement program has systematic fraud, creating both national security risks and undue fiscal burdens. Refugee advocates claim the vetting process for Syrians is airtight, but U.S. security officials say exactly the opposite. An internal Immigrations, Customs, and Enforcement memo states, “[The] refugee program is particularly vulnerable to fraud due to loose evidentiary requirements where at times the testimony of an applicant alone is sufficient for approval.” The memo goes on to say that “the immigration system is a constant target for exploitation” by terrorists. An Immigration and Naturalization Services assistant commissioner said 95 percent of refugee and asylee applications are fraudulent.

The Obama administration has knowingly and routinely allowed illegal aliens falsely claiming asylum to remain in the United States. A September 2016 DHS Inspector General report found that 1,982 aliens from countries known for immigration fraud or terror-links who were scheduled for deportation were instead granted citizenship using false identities because fingerprint records were missing.

The United Nations selects almost all refugees, and the United States takes more refugees than all other resettlement nations combined. Yet many of the tens of thousands of unvettable Syrians who are accepted don’t meet the refugee definition.

Syrian Christians are facing genocide, and certainly do meet the definition, but represent less than 1 percent of those Syrians resettled so far. Syrian Muslims are more than 98 percent of the total. In the interest of diplomacy we are also resettling populations other countries refuse to take. Most recently, the Obama administration offered to accept 2,465 asylum seekers now being detained by Australia which that country refuses to accept because of their possible ties to terrorism. In response to congressional inquiries, the administration has declared information about this agreement classified.

Heavy Costs for Taxpayers Besides Terrorism Risks

Refugee resettlement is administered by three agencies: the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM), the Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), and the Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS). It has grown and metastasized over the years.

In fiscal year 2016, the program cost $2.4 billion, an increase of 205.4 percent since FY 2009. At the last minute Obama boosted ORR’s request to $3.9 billion for FY 2017 to handle the unprecedented flow of minors now being apprehended at the Southwest border. That’s 14,128 in the past two months alone and a 106 percent increase for the year.

Congress provided a pro-rata share of $500 million of this request in the short-term continuing resolution passed on December 9. It cannot be expended until the new Health and Human Services secretary has been installed. He can withhold some or all of those funds, if he chooses.

The table above shows the numbers resettled by category, a total of 195,231 individuals in FY 2015. This represents 20 percent of all immigrants allowed into the United States annually. The numbers will be significantly higher this year if nothing is done.

Since FY 2009, approximately 1 million migrants have arrived through these programs. Program costs average about $10,000 per head in the first year, and refugee welfare use is off the charts, even after five years (see table below). In fact, refugees resettled in the 1980s still receive welfare at rates well in excess of Americans and other immigrants.

The Center for Immigration Studies has estimated the annual cost of resettling Muslim refugees during the first five years at $12,874 per head. Muslim refugees use welfare at higher rates than average. I have estimated a somewhat lower average of $11,574 per head for the entire group. Cumulatively for the years 2009 through 2015, this cohort alone has cost U.S. taxpayers a staggering $48 billion. Since 1980, 3 million have been resettled.

Migrants Create a Heavy Toll on Communities

State and local costs are significant. When the Refugee Act was first passed, the federal government promised to cover 36 months of states’ share of food stamps, Medicaid, Refugee Cash Assistance (RCA), and Refugee Medical Assistance (RMA) for refugees—a huge subsidy. Today it covers no state costs. Refugees rely heavily on local assistance, and school budgets, costs for translation, and other services have exploded. Following is a sampling of problems in many U.S. communities:

Major Conflicts of Interest Among Refugee Resettlers

Nine private contractors, called “Voluntary Agencies” or VOLAGs, resettle refugees with the assistance of 320 “affiliates.” VOLAGs are supposed to consult communities before resettling refugees, but almost never do. They secretly resettle refugees and leave communities to deal with the resulting problems. They regularly withhold information from community leaders and concerned citizens and ignore local complaints.

Refugee resettlement has big effects for small communities throughout the United States, which is a major reason for growing resistance to the program. In one example, a federal agent contacted me in November to describe numerous problems in northern Michigan. He said citizens and public officials from Traverse City and elsewhere expressed concerns over the indiscriminate “dumping” of refugees and illegal aliens in small towns, including the Upper Peninsula, under cover of darkness, without any prior coordination with appropriate public officials (i.e. mayors, town councils, etc.).

Refugees are often employed in the resettlement industry, giving refugees a stake its growth. Many VOLAG leaders who receive federal resettlement grants are former directors of the agencies that administer those grants, and vice versa. Like a revolving door, they cycle in and out of government. For example, Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration Assistant Secretary Ann Richard is a former vice president for one of the nine VOLAGs. She helped found the International Crisis Group, a leftist organization funded by George Soros.

VOLAGs receive a total of about $1 billion per year from taxpayers and are paid by the head, receiving anywhere from $2,025 to more than $5,000 per refugee. The Government Accountability Office has noted that this creates a strong incentive for VOLAGs to constantly resettle more refugees, regardless of whether it is in the interest of the refugee or the target community.

David M. Robinson, who would later lead PRM, said of the refugee industry: “The solution its members offer to every refugee crisis is simplistic and the same: increase the number of admissions to the United States without regard to budgets or competing foreign policy considerations. On the other hand, it is politically well connected, includes major party donors at the local and national levels, and owns the moral high ground on an extremely emotional issue.”

VOLAGs have not faced any kind of meaningful oversight since the program was established in 1980. None have ever faced a public financial audit despite many calls to do so. The program is biased toward continual growth, and security concerns must be addressed.

Prioritizing Refugees Above American Citizens

The Refugee Act of 1980 dictates benefits that refugees must receive. They go to the front of the line for welfare and public housing, jumping ahead of all Americans, including veterans and the disabled. VOLAGs provide:

Housing

Essential furnishings

Food, food allowance

Seasonal clothing

Pocket money

Assistance in applying for public benefits, Social Security cards, language translation, employment services, non-employment services, Medicaid

Assistance with health screenings and medical care

Assistance with registering children in school

Transportation to job interviews and job training

Home visits

Additionally, ORR and other agencies provide numerous special grants available only to refugees. This is supposedly to enable refugees to rapidly become economically self-sufficient. However, ORR’s definition of “economic self-sufficiency” allows refugees to continue to receive every kind of welfare except cash assistance from food stamps or RCA. Refugees thus have a strong incentive to seek U.S. resettlement to obtain benefits.

Maine Gov. Paul LePage told me that elderly autistic residents of Portland, Maine are swelling the rolls of the homeless as their primary caretakers, usually their parents, die, or become unable to care for them, because public housing is taken by refugees.

What Americans and Our Leaders Should Do

The resettlement program is dangerous, expensive, and unfair to Americans. Its structure encourages endless growth, systemic corruption, cronyism, secrecy, and duplicity. The refugee program must be put on hold. Members of Congress have called for a moratorium, and such legislation is circulating. H.R. 3314, the Resettlement Accountability National Security Act, has 86 co-sponsors.

On his first day in office, Trump can pause the entire program by simply resetting the annual refugee targets.

But legislation isn’t needed. On his first day in office, Trump can pause the entire program by simply resetting the annual refugee targets to whatever number has already been reached this fiscal year. The 1980 Refugee Act gives him authority to do this, and subsequent court decisions have declared Congress’s refugee resettlement oversight authority as advisory only.

Trump has stated his desire to halt resettlement from nations of terrorism concern. It would be wiser to pause the entire program.

It costs 12 times as much to resettle refugees as to assist them in place. Almost all refugeeswould prefer to return home than be resettled to a third country. President-Elect Trump’s idea to create “safe zones” in or near countries of conflict is a much more compassionate and cost-effective method of dealing with the refugee crisis. Trump’s State Department should encourage the Gulf States to participate in resettlement, since they currently offer little help.

The VOLAG system needs to be abolished. Asylum and other alternative forms of resettlement should operate case-by-case. Resettlement should be returned to the private act of charity it was before 1980. That structure would be naturally self-limiting, and those financing resettlement would have a much stronger incentive to see that their charitable dollars were not wasted on frauds or potential terrorists. Refugees should be required to become truly economically self-sufficient.

With such restrictions, other nations would have to confront and resolve conflicts they now offload onto America. The U.S. government role should be limited to security: helping create safe zones, identifying other countries that might help more, designating those populations suitable for resettlement, setting numerical limits, and vetting all refugees, asylum seekers, and others seeking U.S. entry. With new leadership, policies and management, Trump’s administration can reinvent the resettlement program to serve America’s interests again.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/01/04/shut-americas-refugee-programs-turn-us-germany/,2017-01-04
How Political Correctness About Islam Made Britain Vulnerable To Chemical Terrorism,"In an interview with The Sunday Times, Britain’s minister for national security, Ben Wallace, had an ominous warning for Britons. Echoing a Europol report that came out last month, Wallace told The Times that ISIS is plotting to deploy chemical weapons on the island nation.

Although no specific plots are underway, the threat is serious enough that British security forces have carried out exercises to prepare for such a disaster, including chemical decontamination drills. So, how does Wallace suggest foiling such plots? A vigilant populace.

Unfortunately for Britain, their oversized sense of political correctness and so-called religious sensitivity toward Islam make vigilance virtually impossible. Recall that ISIS has used mustard gas in the past, both on civilians and on Kurdish soldiers fighting the Islamist group in Syria. The Islamic State is now producing its own chemical weapons, specifically mustard gas, but the group is also thought to have access to Syrian chemical weapons that were never disposed of in the disarmament deal in 2014. Now the fear is that this know-how will be used to inflict mass casualties in the United Kingdom.

The Terrorist Threat Britain Imported

Wallace is concerned, as he should be, that the attack will come from within, from British citizens, not foreign agents. “The insider threat, as we would call it, is real and it can be exploited and there are people trying to do that as we speak. If it’s hard to get in the front door, then what you try and do is get someone on the inside.”

Around 800 Britons have gone to fight with ISIS over the past three years. In November, it was revealed that British special forces were trying to track down 200 of these fighters who had gone off-grid, possibly returning to the United Kingdom to launch attacks there. As ISIS loses territory as a result of allied offensives in Mosul and Raqqa, there is increasing concern about foreign fighters coming home and either plotting attacks or radicalizing others.

There are also several hundred men and women in Britain who were prevented from going to Iraq and Syria, and many more who hold sympathetic views toward ISIS, making the possibility of a chemical weapons, or other mass-casualty attacks, from the inside a real possibility.

In response to this impending threat, Wallace wants the British people to help by reporting anything that seems suspicious. He needs people on the street and in their jobs to keep their eyes open for the “enemy within.” But unfortunately for Wallace, and for the UK’s security, there’s not much hope of this ever happening.

PC-Mongers Make Way for Mass Rape

Wallace’s call for public vigilance is both ironic and impossible given a pervasive culture in Britain that demands absolute tolerance for all things Muslim. It has been ingrained in the British people that any criticism of a person who happens also to be Muslim is an act of intolerance and aggression against the Islamic faith. So, to avoid being labeled an Islamaphobe, people just keep their mouths shut.

This fear of being seen as Islamaphobic was most disgustingly on display in the Rotherham child sex ring scandal. The case involved the sexual exploitation of more than 1,400 young British girls over the course of 16 years. Even though the ongoing sex-trafficking, rape, abduction, and abuse of minors was well-known to city officials and police, they did nothing. Why? Because the perpetrators were Pakistani and no one wanted to be accused of racism.

The Rotherham story originally broke in 2013, much to the horror and outcry of people around the world. But this past summer, three years later, it was revealed that little had been done to eradicate the sex-ring and that it was still happening on an “industrial scale.” It seems fear of accusations of Islamaphobia may still be the reason.

Rotherham isn’t the only example of political correctness at the cost of human suffering. At the end of December, a British woman came out with her own story of being held prisoner for 13 years by a Pakistani man named Malik, beginning at the age of 15. She was raped almost nightly, by him or other men who paid to have sex with her. During this time, she had four children, all of whom were taken from her and sold.

After particularly brutal beatings, Malik would take her to the hospital, and dress her in Muslim clothing, including a hijab, beforehand. She believes that because she was dressed as a Muslim, no health-care workers would report her obvious signs of physical abuse or ask to speak to her alone. According to her, they didn’t want to appear prejudiced against Muslims by assuming that the woman’s bruises were from her husband.

Perhaps most relevant to Wallace’s call for public action was the case of the British counterterrorism agent, herself a Muslim, who reported the extremist views of some of her fellow Muslim co-workers. Thinking this would interest her superiors, she was surprised when they told her that pursuing these complaints would damage her career and reputation. So much for “if you see something, say something.”

Multiculturalism Means Death

How can anyone expect a populace this worried about cultural sensitivity to call authorities if they see a Muslim man or woman doing something suspicious in the workplace or on a public transit line? The tragedy in this, of course, is that it’s a problem of Britain’s own making.

Britain, like most of Europe, has nourished ultra-sensitivity toward its Muslim population as an outgrowth of multiculturalism, one of the pillars of progressivism. This has worked in in perfect harmony with Islamist groups that understand that if they can stop all criticism of Muslims, both legitimate and illegitimate, they can avoid scrutiny when engaging in subversive acts.

Europe is ahead of the United States in this respect, but we are moving in the same direction. Every time a terrorist attack here is perpetrated by a Muslim, there is an outcry from both the mainstream media and Islamist groups like the Council on American-Islamic Relations, that insists talking about the attacker’s religion will lead to Islamaphobic attacks. To convince us further of what bad Islamaphobes we are, there have been numerous incidences of faked hate crimes against Muslims in recent months.

Of course, there are legitimate cases of Islamaphobia and hate crimes in America, and these are disgusting and unacceptable. But we are cultivating an atmosphere where, like Britain, people are afraid that anything they say or do regarding a Muslim will be interpreted as racist.

Consider the couple Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik, who shot and killed 14 coworkers at a Christmas party in San Bernardino in 2015. After the attack, a neighbor of Malik’s mother said she thought something suspicious was happening at the house but didn’t say anything because of fear that people would think she was a bigot.

The threat of Islamist terrorism isn’t going away anytime soon. And we’ve created the perfect storm by going beyond polite and reasonable cultural sensitivity toward our Muslim compatriots by carving out a special class that we’re terrified to criticize. This is going to have security repercussions in Britain, the rest of Europe, and here in the United States. In fact, it already has.

With apologies to Wallace, British law enforcement and intelligence agencies shouldn’t expect ordinary Britons to be vigilant about terrorism. They’ve gotten the message loud and clear: if you suspect a Muslim of wrongdoing, you must be a bigot.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/01/10/political-correctness-islam-made-britain-vulnerable-chemical-terrorism/,2017-01-10
The Comforting Fictions Of Obama’s Farewell Speech,"Watching Barack Obama’s speech at the 2008 DNC in Denver, I doubt I could have imagined the kind of turmoil his presidency would incite. Almost everything has changed in the subsequent years, and yet his farewell speech to the nation was brimming with the same kind of haughty lecturing we got back then.

Obama loves to conflate progressivism with patriotism, pitting the forces of decency and empathy — his own — against the self-serving profiteers and meddling reactionaries who stand in the way. All of it is swathed in phony optimism.

The president’s central case for government’s existence rests on the notion of the state being society’s moral center, engine of prosperity, and arbiter of fairness. This has never been normal. Obama speaks of government as a theocrat might of church—and his fans return the favor by treating him like a pope. This was true in 2008. And it’s true now. Just check out liberal Twitterdom.

There was much to process, and many policy claims to debunk, but for me the most grating aspect of the address were the broader fictions Obama likes to repeat.

“When Congress is dysfunctional,” Obama explained, “we should draw our districts to encourage politicians to cater to common sense and not rigid extremes.” For the president, a “dysfunctional” Congress means a Congress unwilling to pass progressive legislation. That is not the definition of dysfunctional, I’m afraid. Nor is it the definition of extreme.

There is nothing in the Constitution instructing legislators to acquiesce to the president. In the near future, the GOP Congress will be passing tons of legislation, and I can assure you neither Obama, nor his many fans in the media, will be celebrating the fact that Congress is finally “getting stuff done” or “doing its job.” Progress will no longer be measured in the number of bills signed.

Nor should it be. After all, if voters were displeased with the way legislators treated Obama’s agenda, they had the ability to replace these obstinate lawmakers with more cooperative ones. They did not. That’s because gridlock was created by a party that fooled itself into believing it could rule unilaterally. Also, after Democrats passed their massive health-care reform law — and I’m certain there were other reasons, as well — Republicans kept expanding their majorities, and not only in Congress.

Americans voted for equilibrium in DC. Congress was working exactly as it was intended. And it has nothing to do with gerrymandering or voter suppression or fake news or any of the other excuses liberals keep concocting to explain their troubles.

Moreover, the idea that Congress is catering to some “rigid extreme” because elected officials oppose policies that were passed in 2010 might be the prevailing opinion on the Left, but it has no basis in reality. Republican positions, like them or not, are well within the boundaries of normal American attitudes.

That brings me to this nugget. In his farewell address, Obama warned that “our democracy is threatened whenever we take it for granted” (because we don’t talk about politics enough, apparently!) and urged Americans to help rebuild “our democratic institutions.”

Our democracy isn’t in trouble. We just had an election, in which every citizen permitted to vote, and motivated, could do so. Our Electoral College, part of a broader system that most fairly embodies the will of voters in the nation’s 50 states, also worked exactly as intended.

Maybe Obama means we must rebuild our belief in separation of powers, because his administration displayed far more creativity in executive power than it ever did in attempting to build coalitions to pass legislation. Obama regularly ignored “norms” of governance, consistently losing cases before the Supreme Court, entering into international agreements without the Senate, creating immigration policy for millions without Congress, and using the administrative state to legislate environmental policies that couldn’t even pass when Democrats controlled both houses. Those abuses were not normal.

Nor is it normal to wish away the bad things that happened under your watch.

It’s one thing to make claims about how wonderful the recovery has been or how Obama stopped Iran’s nuclear program. Neither are true. But last night, Obama again made the extraordinary claim there has been no successful Islamic terrorism — or whatever euphemism we’re using these days — on the home front. “No foreign terrorist organization,” the president bragged yesterday, “has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland in the last eight years.”

Now, if you don’t count the attack in San Bernardino, where a ISIS-inspired couple murdered 14 people and wounded another 22; or the ISIS-inspired terrorist attack on Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, where 49 people were murdered and 53 wounded; and if you forget the Fort Hood shooting in Texas, where an Islamist U.S. Army officer murdered 13 people and wounded 32; and you skip the Boston Marathon bombings where Islamists murdered three and wounded another 264; then, perhaps, the president’s claim might have some veracity.

Otherwise, the idea is preposterous no matter how meticulously Obama constructs his sentences. This isn’t exactly as blatant a falsehood as our incoming president likes to drop on occasion, but it’s no less misleading. No, there isn’t a central planning committee meeting where violent foreign terrorist organizations hatch a specific plan to attack America. Yet, somehow, the adherents of violent theology know exactly what they need to do without checking in for instructions. Obama spent eight years refusing to acknowledge this reality — and many others.

Last night, he offered Americans a revisionist history of his entire presidency, casting himself as a resilient truth teller and champion of “democracy.” The reality is quite different.

"Thanks To Obama’s Presidency, ISIS Is Alive And Well","Over the past three years, the Islamic State has risen to be the most prominent international terrorist organization in the world. After initially dismissing them as Al Qaeda’s “jayvee team,” in September 2014 President Obama promised to degrade and destroy ISIS. Since then, he and Secretary of State John Kerry have repeatedly insisted that Islamic State is “on the run,” despite ongoing attacks in the West and elsewhere.

Now, with only two weeks left in Obama’s presidency, the reality is that ISIS is far from being defeated. Between the battle of Mosul and recent attacks in Berlin, Istanbul, and Baghdad, it’s evident that ISIS is alive and well, with a global reach.

When Obama leaves office later this month, the ongoing threat of ISIS in the Middle East and elsewhere will stand as an indictment of his administration’s failed foreign policy approach of “leading from behind,” placing domestic political concerns over American interests abroad.

What’s Going On in Mosul

The U.S.-led coalition in Iraq is continuing its efforts to wrest Mosul from ISIS control. When the offensive began in October, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi predicted ISIS would be routed from the city by Christmas. Initially, the coalition forces, including Kurdish units and Shiite militias, met with quick success in the outlying suburbs of the country’s second largest city. But once they moved into the city itself, progress slowed nearly to a halt.

Mosul is full of narrow alleyways that are well known to ISIS fighters who have had months to prepare for this type of battle. Snipers, suicide bombers, and improvised explosive devices are taking their toll on coalition fighters. Some units have reportedly lost up to a third of their troops.

The coalition began a renewed effort last week, and while they have reportedly regained control of 60 percent of eastern Mosul, it’s unclear what the coalition will face in the more heavily populated western portion of the city. Prime Minister al-Abadi is now forecasting that it will take three more months before the fighting is over. But this prediction seems doubtful. Some analysts are looking toward the summer as a likely timeline for victory. And a lot can happen between now and then to turn the tide.

A Victory in Mosul Won’t End ISIS

Even if Mosul is retaken by summer, that won’t be the end of ISIS. The U.S. commander of the coalition against ISIS predicts that it could take up to two years to deprive the Islamic State fully of its territory in Iraq and Syria. America currently has nearly 5,000 troops deployed to Iraq. How many more soldiers will we have to commit to eradicate ISIS from the Middle East?

In the wake of the renewed efforts in the Mosul offensive, ISIS has claimed responsibility for three bombings that hit Baghdad in the last few days. One of these attacks was aimed at Sadr City, a majority Shiite neighborhood. 28 people were killed in the attacks, including seven policemen.

Islamic State fighters have been launching attacks elsewhere in Iraq as well. They temporarily cut off the road that connects Mosul to Baghdad, killing 16 coalition fighters in the process. And on Sunday, five suicide bombers attacked the Shiite holy city of Najaf, killing seven.

ISIS Is Still Focused on Attacking the West

Outside of Iraq and Syria, ISIS is still proving to be a deadly threat. On New Year’s Eve, a lone gunman opened fire at revelers at an upscale Istanbul nightclub. Dressed in a Santa Claus costume, the man killed 39 people before disappearing. Turkish authorities are still searching for him. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, calling it retribution for Turkey’s assault against ISIS in Syria.

It’s not clear, however, whether the attack was motivated by Turkey’s involvement in fighting ISIS in Syria or whether this was part of a larger push on the part of ISIS to renew violence abroad. At the beginning of December, ISIS’ new spokesman called for a surge in lone wolf attacks in Europe, the U.S., Russia, and Iran. He told adherents of the group to attack people “in their markets, roads and clubs.” In the days before December 31, an ISIS affiliated group called for sympathizers to turn New Year’s Eve into a “bloody horror movie.”

Sadly, these calls for violence were made a reality in Istanbul and, prior to that, in Berlin, where a Tunisian man drove a truck into a large crowd at a Christmas market, killing 12.

Winning the Ideological Battle Won’t Be Easy

Some of this behavior—the suicide attacks in Baghdad and the renewed call for violence—may be evidence that ISIS is lashing out as it struggles to retain territory. But while the Istanbul New Year’s Eve attack may have been payback for Turkey’s offensive against the Islamist group, their past attacks have had other motivations—namely, killing infidels, Christian and Muslim alike. These recent attacks are, therefore, not just symptoms of a breakdown of ISIS; they are part of its overall strategy.

Experts are predicting that as ISIS loses territory it will shift back toward its guerrilla warfare roots. But recall that ISIS operatives were launching similar attacks at the height of their territorial control. It has always been a part of their modus operandi.

If ISIS eventually loses its territory, it will change the dynamics of the organization but it won’t make the group any less dangerous. No one considered al-Qaeda to be “jayvee” because they held no territory. Ridding ISIS of their landed caliphate is one step toward defeating them—a step yet to be completed—but it’s hardly the only one. There is an ideological battle to be won, and it won’t be easy.

Obama Helped Cultivate—Not Kill—The Islamic State

As its days dwindle, the Obama administration is far from completing its avowed objective to degrade and destroy ISIS. This is, in part, because it has lacked the moral fortitude to deal with ISIS effectively. Obama, with the collusion of the mainstream media, has refused to call out the dangers of radical Islam both abroad and at home. In fact, he won’t even acknowledge that religion has anything to do with ISIS and its allure to young men and women around the world.

What’s more, Obama’s feckless foreign policy has been marked by hesitancy and a resistance to using force. His myopic obsession with getting troops out of Iraq is what opened the way for ISIS’s rapid conquests in Iraq in the first place. And his dogged insistence to keep boots off the ground has slowed the coalition’s progress in defeating them.

ISIS may not be as strong as ever. But this varsity team hardly looks like it’s drawing its dying breath. ISIS fighters still have control of Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, and are proving difficult to defeat there. And, perhaps more importantly, they still have the power to inspire.

With little over two weeks left in his presidency, Obama will leave office having overseen the rise of ISIS. He will not be able to say the same about supervising its demise.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/01/11/thanks-obama-isis-alive-well/,2017-01-11
Former Charlie Hebdo Writer Says She Quit Because The Terrorists Won,"Last week marked the second anniversary of the Charlie Hebdo massacre. Two Islamist terrorists armed with AK-47s attacked the magazine’s offices and slaughtered a dozen people in cold blood. Zineb El Rhazoui, one of the magazine’s more notorious journalists and an outspoken critic of Islamism, used the anniversary of the attack to speak out for the first time about why she decided to leave Charlie Hebdo last fall.

In an interview with AFP, Rhazoui said the French satirical magazine has become soft on Islamic extremism. “Charlie Hebdo died on 7 January,” she said, the day their offices were stormed and their staff gunned down. What she loved about Charlie Hebdo, Rhazoui said, was its belief in “freedom at any cost,” something she says the magazine no longer cares about.

Charlie Hebdo Lays Down Its Flag

Rhazoui’s words are meant to cut. Charlie Hebdo had long prided itself as the bad boy of satirical journalism because of its willingness to write and publish criticism about anyone or anything. Nothing was off-limits, including Islam.

In 2006, the magazine decided to republish cartoons of Mohammed previously printed in a Danish newspaper, Jyllands-Posten. Charlie Hebdo was subsequently sued for inciting hatred, a lawsuit the courts eventually threw out.

In the years since, the magazine continued to feature cartoons of Mohammed, sometimes on the cover. Of course, it also featured irreverent, even offensive, cartoons of Jesus and Jewish rabbis. You may not like Charlie Hebdo. You might think they’re immature and in poor taste, and I won’t argue with you. But they have pushed the limits of free speech and encouraged debate, particularly about Islam.

Not surprisingly, Islamists took notice. Charlie Hebdo’s editors began receiving death threats and in 2011 their office was firebombed, although no one was injured. Then, in January 2015, two brothers of Algerian origin with ties to al-Qaeda attacked the magazine’s Paris office and killed 12 staff members, including their beloved editor Stéphane Charbonnier, and injured several others.

A week after the attack, the remaining staff put out a new edition showing Mohammed holding a sign that read “Je suis Charlie,” the hashtag that was used on social media to express solidarity with the magazine. Yet six months later Charlie Hebdo staff decided to stop drawing cartoons of Mohammed.

Resisting Islamic Fascism

To Rhazoui, this was a fatal blow to the fight for freedom of expression and for keeping Islam’s dictates from becoming the de facto law of the land in the West. To her, it’s also about fighting fascism.

In an interview from November in Le Figaro, she argued that Islamism is a form of fascism. Both ideologies celebrate an “absolute cult of personality” regarding their leader. In the case of Islam, that person is Mohammed, who is so sacred that it is forbidden to depict him. Islamism, like fascism, demands “uniformity of thought.”

For Islamists, and indeed many Muslims, it’s not enough that Muslims not depict Mohammed. No one else must be permitted to do so, regardless of their beliefs. Everyone in the entire world, as far as Islamists are concerned, must conform to this set of rules and strictures. This is why, for Rhazoui, continuing to publish images of Mohammed is so important to battling Islamism. It pushes back against this cult of personality that she identifies as so dangerous.

Rhazoui was not in the Charlie Hebdo offices on the day of the attack, but she’s no stranger to the trade-off between speaking out about Islam and personal safety. She now has 24-hour security and is sometimes called the most protected woman in France because of her open criticism of Islam. To her, this risk is worth it.

Terrorism Has Accomplished Its Goals

That doesn’t mean the other side’s arguments are without merit. When announcing the decision to stop drawing Mohammed, Charlie Hebdo’s editor, Laurent Sourisse, said, “We’ve done our job. We have defended the right to caricature.” He notes that while they are expected to continue exercising their freedom of expression, no one else is similarly willing to take the risk of depicting Mohammed.

Sourisse told the press that he fears the public is less and less tolerant of the magazine, and that no one would defend their right to publish a cartoon of Mohammed now. He might be right. People are also afraid to speak out, and understandably so. Last year, the magazine’s financial director, Eric Portheault, said, “We feel terribly alone. We hoped that others would do satire too. No one wants to join us in this fight because it’s dangerous.”

Despite the initial outpour of support, the magazine has continued to face criticism for its daring. A few months after the 2015 attack, Doonesbury cartoonist Garry Trudeau published an article in The Atlantic in which he accused Charlie Hebdo of committing a cardinal sin of satire, “punching downward.” In January 2016, the liberal media hordes came out in full force against the magazine for its depictions of a Syrian boy who washed up on the shores of Turkey.

International solidarity with the magazine came mainly from sympathy toward victims who suffered a terrible death, not from a true commitment to free speech. After all, many news outlets, including Jyllands-Posten, declined to reprint the cartoon.

So maybe the editors of Charlie Hebdo are right—there’s no real appetite to push back against the censorship that Islamists, and many on the Left, are pushing. Elsewhere in Europe, comments about Islam and migrants continue to spur objections to free speech. Dutch lawmaker Geert Wilders was convicted in December of “inciting discrimination” for asking a riled-up crowd whether they wanted more or fewer Moroccans in the country.

Beyond state action, a general climate of self-censorship prevails across Europe, where citizens are afraid to criticize anything Muslims do, much less Islam itself. But is the fact that no one else will do it, or that Charlie Hebdo has fewer and fewer defenders, reason enough to stop? Rhazoui says no. Sadly, she may be one of the few remaining holdouts. If the most daring publication in the world won’t publish images of Mohammed, who will?

Let's Stop Pretending The Obama Administration Was 'Scandal Free',"In his final few days in office, President Obama and his pals have been frantically spinning his tenure in the White House as a “scandal-free” eight years.

Just watch this exchange between CNN’s Jake Tapper and White House chief of staff Denis McDonough on Sunday in which McDonough claims the Obama administration has been free of scandal.

Denis McDonough: I'm proud the Obama administration has been ""historically free of scandal"" #CNNSOTU https://t.co/p7re4TnxaM — CNN (@CNN) January 15, 2017

McDonough’s rhetoric echoes that of President Obama, who said last week he was the first president in modern history that “hasn’t had a major scandal in the White House.” You can also watch this video montage of Obama and friends repeatedly insisting his tenure was “scandal free.”

So. Much. Spin. It’s almost as if Obama realizes that his legacy — which is comprised largely of executive orders that can easily be undone under a new president — is toast. To suggest an enduring legacy his team wants folks to fixate on his “scandal-free” administration because President-elect Donald Trump has said he plans to tear up the Iran nuclear deal and will work with Congress to repeal Obama’s signature health care law, effectively erasing two of Obama’s largest “accomplishments.”

To his credit, Obama wasn’t caught having an extramarital affair with a White House intern, but that doesn’t mean he or his administration were free of scandal. The helpful folks over at Grabien have compiled a list of the Obama administration’s worst scandals and gaffes. So far there are 730 of them, but for the sake of space and time, I’m going to highlight five of the worst.

1. Fast and Furious

Remember “Fast and Furious,” the Bureau of Alcohol Firearms and Tobacco’s illicit gun-running operation that used tax dollars to funnel guns into the hands of Mexican drug lords? The ATF was reportedly using the operation as part of a campaign to push for additional gun control measures. This operation eventually led to the deaths of at least two American border patrol agents and the whistleblower who spilled the beans was later fired by the ATF, a move he says was politically motivated and part of an effort to punish him for going public. To this day, more than 1,000 guns remain missing as a result of this scandal.

This shouldn’t need to be said: restricting Americans’ constitutional right to bear arms is not what the president, or his employees, should be doing. That two Americans were killed in such a constitutionally questionable operation makes it all the worse.

2. Benghazi

In 2011, Obama’s State Department left four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, to be killed by terrorists in Benghazi, Libya. In the weeks leading up to the attack, other countries withdrew their diplomatic presence from the region, but Secretary of State Hillary Clinton forced Americans to stay in a compound that did not have adequate security measures. She also ignored multiple requests for additional security from Stevens in the final moments of his life while he and his companions were in the midst of a deadly terror attack.

Afterwards, the Obama administration tried to cover up the true nature of the attack as part of backlash against an inflammatory video published online. In reality, Clinton knew the danger these men were in and simply didn’t care. When they begged and pleaded for help, Obama’s State Department essentially shrugged and said “figure it out for yourselves.”

3. That Time Obama Pretended a Massive Oil Spill Wasn’t Happening

On April 23, 2010, the same day the U.S. Coast Guard pronounced 11 Deepwater workers dead, Barack and Michelle Obama headed to North Carolina for BBQ and a vacation. Obama didn’t visit the gulf area until May 2, several days after Gov. Bobby Jindal declared the region to be in a state of emergency. When he does finally visit, he leaves soon after to play golf.

This isn’t the only time Obama chose to have fun instead of visiting the site of a tragedy. He took two weeks to visit San Bernardino after terrorists killed 14 people. When he finally did visit the site of the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil at that time, he only did so during a pit stop en route to his family’s annual vacation to Hawaii.

4. Obamacare

From the skyrocketing premiums to extremely long wait times in emergency rooms, Obama’s signature health-care law has been plagued with scandal after scandal. The rollout of Healthcare.gov was a huge disaster. The website, which was supposed to be a quick and easy way for Americans to shop and compare prices for insurance plans in the exchange marketplace, was a glitchy heap of garbage. As it turns out, one of the executives at CGI Federal, the company that received a no-bid contract to build the site, was a classmate of Michelle Obama — spurring many to suspect that cronyism and special interests plagued the project from start to finish.

Despite assurances from the president that “if you like your health care plan you can keep it,” millions of Americans lost their health insurance plans because Obamacare essentially outlawed them. Obama’s Health and Human Services then used the law to bully nuns and a Christian-owned businesses for refusing to provide contraceptives to their employees on the grounds that it violated their conscience.

5. When Obama’s Tax Collectors Targeted Conservative Groups and Got Away With It

Under Obama, the IRS targeted conservative groups by flagging tax-exempt applications from organizations with conservative-sounding names to require additional screening. When individuals complained about how the IRS was intentionally ignoring applications from some groups, they were intimidated by the agency to keep their mouths shut.

The IRS’s treatment impeded many conservatives groups from getting off the ground, which may have had a major political impact: a 2013 study by the American Enterprise Institute concluded that the IRS’s actions may have swung the 2012 election. Yet at the height of the scandal, the federal agency decided to hand out more than $70 million in bonuses to the same paper-pushers who bullied conservative organizations.

In 2015, the Department of Justice announced that after a two-year-long investigation into the matter, they would do nothing about about it and that Lois Lerner, the woman allegedly responsible for the entire ordeal, was off the hook. Meanwhile the same Justice Department announced it would go after the undercover reporters who exposed Planned Parenthood’s organ harvesting scheme, yet would not look into whether or not the nation’s largest abortion provider did anything wrong.

President Obama’s tenure has not been without scandal. To pretend otherwise is not just embarrassing, but gaslights the struggles of those who have suffered at the hands of his carelessness and intolerance. It tells the family members of the Benghazi victims that their deaths were no big deal. It also sends a message to conservatives and religious Americans alike that the way they were personally victimized by factions of his administration is acceptable. Obama’s misdeeds need to be acknowledged to hold his administration and legacy responsible.

Here Are Foreign-Born Terrorists Reporters Can’t Believe Exist,"When arguing with the Left about matters of national security and terrorism, one becomes accustomed to their habitual moving of goal posts and artificial construction of sample sizes that deliberately exclude relevant cases.

The most notorious example, of course, is the beloved “since 9/11…” canard, such as the oft-repeated although false claim that since 9/11 right-wing terrorists have killed more Americans than Islamic terrorists.

The recent executive order by the Trump administration on immigration led to an urgent desire to proclaim that there is no terrorism threat from immigrants. The most egregious example: A tweet from The New York Times’ White House correspondent Maggie Haberman, who is also a CNN analyst. She posed the question, “Other than San Bernardino shootings, has there been a terrorist attack involving a non-US-born attacker since 9/11?”

Of course, there is no sensible reason for excluding San Bernardino shooter Tasheen Malik, who was born in Pakistan, from a list of terror attacks. The attack killed 14 and took place only last year.

But even within the confines of such a ludicrously constructed sample, the question surprised more up-to-speed denizens of Twitter, who quickly bombarded Haberman with lists of successful and unsuccessful attacks carried out by non-U.S.-born individuals, including some of the most notorious recent terror attacks.

Yes, Foreign-Born Immigrants Have Committed Terrorism

Among such individuals: the Tsarnaev brothers of the Boston Marathon bombing, who were both born abroad. Tamerlan was born in Kyrgyzstan in 1986, and Dzhokhar was reportedly born in Dagestan.

The 2015 Chattanooga Recruiting Center shooter, Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, was born in Kuwait and lived in Jordan before migrating to the United States at the age of six. He killed five people.

Ohio State University attacker Abdul Razak Artan, who ran over several fellow students with a car before attacking them with a butcher knife, was a refugee born in Somalia who had only been in the United States for two years.

Ahmad Khan Rahimi, born in Afghanistan, detonated a bomb near a 5K run event, then another in downtown Manhattan in October of last year.

Dahir Adan, a Somali born in Kenya who immigrated to the United States as a child, launched a mass stabbing attack at a St. Cloud Minnesota mall in 2016. And these are only a few recent examples.

Let’s Just Define Away Counterexamples

While it might be amusing to imagine that a mainstream media figure of some note is totally oblivious to any of the details of recent terror attacks, it’s almost beside the point. Had Haberman known better, perhaps she’d have simply constructed a question that did meet what appears to be her preformed opinion that foreign-born individuals are nearly incapable of representing a threat.

That was the position CNN took in its piece on the Trump administration’s executive order. The piece moved the goal posts yet again, insisting that no refugee had carried out a fatal terror attack in the United States. That’s surely cold comfort to the families of those killed by Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, two Iraqi refugees settled in Bowling Green, Kentucky.

After their fingerprints were discovered on Iraqi IEDs, the two Iraqi refugees were caught in an FBI counterterrorism investigation, where Alwan bragged about using a sniper rifle to kill American troops abroad. The two plotted to kill returning U.S. troops as well. An IED constructed by Alwan is believed to have killed four Pennsylvania National Guardsmen in 2005.

That case resulted in a six-month freeze on Iraqi refugee resettlement in 2011 as U.S. authorities attempted to clamp down on serious screening problems. But, according to CNN’s twisted logic, these Iraqi refugees were never a threat. Ironically, the more attacks American law enforcement successfully prevent or mitigate, the less of a threat there is, according to the CNN model.

If one were truly interested in whether there is a terror threat from individuals born abroad, one would examine the totality of activity, not a narrowly constructed definition aimed to minimize it. That’s what senators Ted Cruz and Jeff Sessions did last June when they examined 580 individuals successfully prosecuted on terrorism offenses from September 2001 until 2014. According to the senators, 380 were foreign-born and at least 40 were refugees. While not all of those cases involved successful or attempted terror attacks, all involved cases that were terrorism-related.

Haberman’s offhand tweet is a snapshot of the willingness of the mainstream media to engage in reflective self-censoring, a kind of doublethink, where reporters seem to remain proudly unaware of key evidence that would contradict their pre-established conclusions. Unfortunately for The New York Times correspondent, not everyone on social media was inclined to play along.

Here’s What Trump’s Immigration Order Says And How It Needs To Be Fixed,"There are many strong feelings on many sides about President Trump’s executive order that adjusts U.S. policy towards refugees and visa processing from select countries. Sadly, very little of this commentary is informed by facts about either the EO itself, or about crisis migration policy in the United States generally.

Because of the administration’s excessive haste to act and media personalities’ haste to judge, reasonable discussion of American crisis migration policy has been all but snuffed out. Understanding U.S. policy towards crisis migrants is hard.

If you want sound-bites and one-liners, this article won’t be of much use to you, because it’s an effort to take a serious look and figure out what’s really going on in this EO. If you actually want to understand U.S. immigration policy, you’ve got to use some critical thinking, a practice all-too-rare when “the narrative” needs to be advanced on TV.

So, if you have the patience to understand what the EO actually means and the effects it may have, read on. I will go through all the major provisions of the EO one by one. We’ll skip the fluff in the first two sections, and start with the meaty bit, Section 3.

Section 3: The Visa Ban

The media has focused on the blanket ban on all visas for all people (except diplomats) with citizenship from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen. This means no tourists, no students, no immigrants, no refugees, no nothing. The EO does include permission for Customs to give “case-by-case” exceptions, but there do not appear to have been many exceptions yet (I could find only one documented case), and no guidance was given to Customs about what rules to use for making such exceptions.

The ban is not permanent, lasting only 90 days, but, as with the refugee ban, can be renewed or extended. Indeed, Section 3(e) of the EO actually orders the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to come up with a list of countries for a more permanent ban. So this EO is teeing up for a more permanent ban in the future.

Some critics have claimed this EO is a “Muslim ban.” That’s debatable. The countries selected were based on a list provided by the Obama administration, and the Obama administration had already imposed stricter visa screening requirements on those countries.

However, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani has claimed that President Trump did explicitly say he wanted to ban Muslims. Yet most Muslims will be unaffected. The vast majority of Muslims and Muslim countries are in Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, or Central Asia. Within the Middle East, large countries like Egypt, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia were not restricted.

Some EO supporters have claimed the seven banned nations were selected due to a unique terrorist threat. This is not quite true. The Obama administration did identify them as places of concern, and most do have active sectarian conflicts and terrorist activity, but, the truth is, they have no common thread. Many unstable or violent places were not included (Chad, Central African Republic, Mali, Egypt, Ukraine, Nigeria, etc). Several of these even involve similar large-scale jihadist insurgencies similar to those observed in the banned countries. Iran, meanwhile, has no violent insurgency at all.

Furthermore, not a single American has died as a result of terrorist attacks committed by any citizen of the seven banned countries in this millennium.* Of course, this doesn’t mean, in the absence of a ban, no attack would occur in the future, but these countries have not posed a unique risk in the past. Additionally, countries whose citizens have perpetrated attacks, like Pakistan or Saudi Arabia, were not banned.

EO critics have claimed these countries were selected to avoid Trump’s properties, implicitly rewarding countries for doing business with the Trump Organization. This view is likewise hard to support with facts. Many countries with no presence of the Trump organization but with violent insurgencies were not banned, like Chad or South Sudan. Many Muslim countries with no Trump properties were not banned, like Afghanistan or Oman.

The truth is, there is no single rational factor that correlates with the seven banned countries. They do not share close religious similarities (Iran, Yemen, and Iraq have large Shi’a populations; Syria is largely Alawi and Sunni; Libya and Somalia are heavily Sunni). They do not all have insurgencies. Their governments are not all enemies of the United States; some, like Iraq, are even our close wartime allies!

Section 3(g): Rules for Exceptions

Aside from arbitrary countries, the EO was poorly administered. It became effective almost immediately upon issuance, giving Customs no time to develop rules and practices or train personnel. It impacted even people who boarded planes before the president declared it.

Plus, it was unclear who should be banned. What if a person served as a U.S. military translator in Iraq? Is he or she banned? Thus far, the answer is yes. What if they have dual citizenship between the United Kingdom and Syria? Banned too! What about foreigners who are lawful permanent residents of the United States? They were initially banned as well, but DHS has since announced they will be allowed in. It is unclear if the White House supports this change.

It is reasonable for the administration to restrict admission of people from countries of unique concern. The president has the power to do this. Both President Bush and President Obama used this power in moments of crisis to ensure national security. But that power must be exercised wisely: government agencies need clear guidance, not “case-by-case” exceptions with no rules about who gets in and who doesn’t. They need time to prepare implementation, and we need a consistent policy, not one that waffles every few hours as the protests and judicial orders ebb and flow.

Section 4: Vetting

Much has been made of the need for more vetting, and I agree with that need. However, few commentators have taken the time to review the proposed vetting changes. The central change proposed is the creation of a national identity database for immigrants that tracks documents, helps identify document fraud or forgeries, and that allows diverse federal agencies to collaborate.

Such an individual level identity-verification database would indeed be highly useful, and is certainly legal. It might not find many terrorists, but it probably will find lots of visa fraud, which is a serious problem worth fixing. However, some immigrants do go on to become citizens. Large national databases of personal information about citizens should raise red flags for conservatives. Thus we will need rules about how this database is to be used and developed.

Section 5: Large Changes to U.S. Refugee Policy

The executive order makes many major changes to refugee policy. Section A halts all new refugee arrivals for 120 days, pending implementation of improved vetting procedures. Section B orders the State Department to prioritize religious minorities when refugee admissions begin again. Section C indefinitely excludes all Syrian refugees, even after the 120-day pause ends. Section D reduces the total, maximum refugee arrivals from 110,000 to 50,00. For reference, the typical cap has between 60,000 and 80,000, but President Obama raised it to 110,000. Section E creates another “case-by-case” exemption, that State and DHS may admit unique individuals, or those already in transit to the United States. This is a lot to unpack, but I’ll try to do it quickly.

What Is a Refugee?

But before we can discuss this order, we should make sure we know what a refugee is.

I have extensively discussed that here in the past. Currently, European states are inundated with crisis migrants from Africa and the Middle East who have arrived by foot, car, boat, and plane, demanding the recognition of rights assigned to them by international treaties to which all developed nations are party.

These un-vetted crisis migrants arrive without warning, in disorganized fashion, and claim a right called “asylum,” or “asylee status.” To put it bluntly, asylum is a kind of illegal immigration with special human rights claims.

Asylum-seekers housed outside of refugee camps in large numbers can overwhelm administrative bureaucracies and may prove nearly impossible for security services to police.

The United States traditionally does not accept a large number of asylees. Indeed, the most we ever accepted was 39,000 in 2001, while refugee admissions have usually been around 60,000 to 100,000 per year, except right after 9/11.

There’s a reason the U.S. has always preferred refugee resettlement over asylum-seekers: as Europe is discovering, asylum-seekers housed outside of refugee camps in large numbers can overwhelm administrative bureaucracies and may prove nearly impossible for security services to police. Europe’s problems with millions of asylees are serious, difficult to solve, and, thankfully, are distinctly European problems. The United States does not face even remotely similar challenges with crisis migrants.

“Refugees” such as those the EO discusses are crisis migrants who flee to a designated UN-monitored refugee camp. They remain in that camp or its environs, and do not proceed to a third country and seek long-term residence. They receive UN-provided aid, and generally must prove they are innocent people disrupted by war rather than combatants.

After a refugee has been in a camp, registered with the United Nations, and proved basic identity, they can try to prove that returning home is impossible, and express a desire to be permanently resettled abroad.

Most crisis-migrant-associated attacks have been carried out by asylees, not resettled refugees.

To be clear, asylees do not forswear their former homes: refugees essentially do. They are announcing to friends and family alike that their old life is done, a new one must begin. After clearing a round of UN-vetting, they are “submitted” for resettlement. Partner countries, mostly the United States, can then receive them for resettlement, after further rounds of vetting. This process can take anywhere from 6 months to 10 years, with one to three years being fairly normal.

The vetting process is thorough, but imperfect. While rates of crime and terrorism are lower for refugees than for asylees, and lower than rates for native-born U.S. citizens, they are not strictly zero if we include the second generation. However, the most successful crisis-migrant-associated terrorist attacks in the United States, like the Boston bombing, were carried out by individuals who arrived via asylum, or whose parents arrived that way, not, apparently, true refugee status.

The same rule holds for European terrorism: most crisis-migrant-associated attacks have been carried out by asylees, not resettled refugees! This is not surprising given that refugees are extensively vetted, while asylees are not. Again, the European experience is unlike the issue we face in the United States.

Section 5(a) and 5(d): How Cap-and-Pause Works

Now that we know what a refugee is, we can explore the changes made. Let’s start with the cap-and-pause issue. Administrative barriers, lack of suitable applicants, or policy factors mean that the United States usually undershoots its refugee cap. As a result, a 50,000 refugee cap means there will be fewer than 50,000 refugees admitted; 50,000 is the maximum legal amount, not an actual target. Regarding the 120-day halt to admissions that applies to all refugees, it is unclear why the Trump administration chose to block all countries, instead of just those from the specified visa-ban countries.

Additionally, that’s 50,000 admissions for Fiscal Year 2017, which ends in September 2017. From October to January 2017, 32,000 refugees have already been admitted in FY2017. All interviews and admissions are paused until late May. It is unlikely the State Department can vet 18,000 refugees and get them moved between late May and late September, especially if the new vetting process is made more intensive.

As such, this cap-and-pause strategy is a subtle way of ensuring that probably substantially less than 50,000 refugees will be resettled in FY 2017. This is especially likely if the 120-day pause is extended. For reference, the only time the United States has had such low refugee admissions is the period immediately after 9/11.

Section5(b): The Religious Minority Preference

President Trump has stated that the goal of prioritizing persecuted minorities is to implicitly prioritize Christians facing persecution in the Middle East. However, while that may be the intention, that is not what the text says. It says minority religions experiencing persecution shall be prioritized; Christianity is not mentioned.

Legal or not, this prioritization will fail in its stated goal of protecting vulnerable minorities.

This matters, because U.S. and international law already establishes religious persecution as a valid consideration in granting refugee status. Persecutors are to be denied refugee status, while their victims are categorically eligible. The president’s order to prioritize minority religions is not out of line with, say, President Obama prioritizing refugees from Syria.

Many presidents have opted to prioritize certain specific concerns at specific times. Admitting only Christians could create legal problems, but if the rule includes Muslims when they are a minority, as in Burma, or Yazidis in Iraq, then it is likely compliant with existing law. Legal or not, however, this prioritization will fail in its stated goal of protecting vulnerable minorities.

Most refugees do not come from Syria, Iraq, or the other countries the Trump administration has specified. In 2016, 43,000 refugees were admitted from the seven Muslim-majority countries for which additional visa restrictions were announced. Fifty-four thousand came from other countries. In other words, the majority of refugees being denied entry aren’t even from high-risk countries.

Of the 43,000 from the visa-ban countries in 2016, 7,000 were non-Muslims who could face serious difficulties if they remain in Muslim-dominated refugee camps. In other words, Muslims coming from these high-risk countries amounted to about 36,000 people.

But keep in mind that the United States admitted a total of 52,000 non-Muslim refugees in 2016. This means that even if the administration did manage to hit their 50,000 refugee cap (unlikely), and even if there were not a single Muslim in that crowd, there would still be 2,000 fewer non-Muslim refugees! No matter how you cut the numbers, the religious minorities this EO purports to help come out worse off.

We have no explanation for why a Seventh Day Adventist from the Congo or a Pentecostal from Ukraine is viewed as a security threat. There is no rationale whatsoever for denying these people entry. I’ve been to a Ukrainian Pentecostal church. Although I’m a Lutheran and thus tend to be on the stodgy side of things, I assure you, they’re swell folks!

Section 5(c) and 5(e): Little Protection For Syrian Religious Minorities

Section 5(c) states that, even after the 120-day halt to refugee admissions, we still won’t accept Syrian refugees. Consider that for a moment. If the goal is to protect religious minorities subject to persecution, then why would the EO create an enduring ban on all refugees from the country with the most active persecutions?

Some have suggested that section 5(e) offers an outlet. This section does give case-by-case discretion to State and DHS. However, section 5(e) also empowered State and DHS to grant exemptions for refugees we have already admitted who are in transit to the United States: in fact, exemptions have not been granted for those refugees!

Refugees have been stopped at airports, despite explicit orders here saying that in-transit refugees do not have to be stopped. In sum, there is little reason to believe this unexplained case-by-case exemption authority will actually be used to allow in religious minorities. In practice, Section 5(c) is an abandonment of Syrian religious minorities.

Section 7: Biometric Tracking

Again, most media coverage has ignored this provision. The United States has been trying to implement full biometric entry-exit tracking for all people for years now, and the project has taken a while to complete. This EO is ordering DHS to double down and get the job done, which could indeed help improve the security at airports. Getting this system finished would be a real benefit for all Americans and for the world.

Section 8 and 9: Making Travel Harder for Everyone

Before this EO, people who visit the United States on a temporary visa could drop their passport off at a U.S. consular office (think something like a Customs office) and have it renewed more-or-less automatically, as long as there were no red flags picked up by State or DHS. Section 8 ends that program, and requires all visa renewals to go in for another interview.

This will add tons of work for U.S. Consular officers abroad, and inconvenience many travelers to the United States. This affects every country in the world except the 38 with visa-free travel to the United States, so it is surprising it has gotten so little media attention. In order to handle this workload, the EO authorizes a hiring binge of visa interviewers. Yes, that’s right: amidst a hiring freeze, the federal government can now hire lots more embassy workers for the menial task of asking tourists what they plan to see in the United States.

Section 9 is related, and is aimed at punishing countries that charge excessive fees on U.S. travelers. This might help lower visa fees for Americans, so could do some real good! However, it could also lead to many countries simply refusing to cooperate, and everyone facing higher travel costs on all fronts, making it costlier to do business, and harder for foreign tourists to visit the United States and buy our products. It is unclear right now what the effect will be.

Section 10: The Public Terrorist List

Section 10 is kind of like a sex offender registry, but for terrorism by foreigners. It requires DHS, every 180 days, to announce a list of foreign nationals who have even been charged with terrorism or gender-based violence.

Now, on its face, this is not unreasonable: most of this is public record anyways, it’s just now being collected in one place. However, many critics have noted that listing only foreign nationals could make it look like only foreign nationals commit acts of terror. However, most terrorist attacks in the United States are carried out by American citizens like one of the San Bernardino attackers, or Omar Mateen at the Pulse nightclub. It is unclear why only foreign nationals are viewed as posing a terror threat worthy of public notice.

Fix It, and Fast

The current EO was rolled out in a haphazard way that damages any effort to have a serious conversation about refugee admittance and the security concerns of many Americans. It poisons the well of debate. Reasonable people can disagree about how many refugees we should have, but using a 120-day halt to game the numbers and make hitting your own publicly announced cap nearly impossible seems underhanded.

Using a 120-day halt to game the numbers and make hitting your own publicly announced cap nearly impossible seems underhanded.

Most reasonable people would agree that banning people who have never been associated with any terrorist attack in our country (say, Bhutanese Hindus) doesn’t make much sense. Reasonable people can disagree about the right security precautions for Syrians, but most people would agree that at least the persecuted religious minorities should be given a categorical exception to any ban, not just an unused “case-by-case” exemption.

Reasonable people can disagree about how much vetting we should be doing (probably more!), but surely nobody thinks the solution is to force the State Department to stop all vetting for 120 days. Reasonable people can disagree about how to handle travel from dangerous, war-torn countries, but a blanket ban that hits U.S. permanent residents, students at American universities, and that separates mothers and their children seems over the top.

This EO can be fixed. DHS’s decision to admit U.S. permanent residents is an important first step. We need more fixes, and fast: an end to any halt on refugees from countries with no visa ban, a categorical exemption for religious minorities in Syria, a more historically normal refugee cap like 70,000, maybe even a special additional cap dedicated to religious minorities, if the Trump administration is sincere about helping these people suffering for their faith.

Keeping Americans safe must always be the first priority for any president. But while that desire for safety is understandable, it does not excuse an executive order that is simply not well thought out. We need our leaders to be wise, not just aggressive, in tackling our national challenges. This EO can be fixed, it should be fixed, it is not even that hard to fix, if the administration truly wants to keep Americans safe and display to the world the strength of the American way.

Correction: This sentence — “Furthermore, not a single American has died as a result of terrorist attacks committed by any citizen of the seven banned countries in this millennium”– has been changed to reflect that no fatalities have occurred, and the following clarification added below.

*However, somewhere between 2 and 41 Somalian refugees have been charged with terror-related offenses. Of those up to 41 potential refugee criminals, no more than 3 involved attacks on American soil; the rest were all related to support of radical Islamist groups abroad. The exact number is uncertain as a charged person’s immigration status is not always publicly announced.

These attacks should not be generalized to all refugees, however: Somalian refugees have vastly lower levels of education than other groups: 3% higher education attendance versus 43% for Iraqis, 29% for Iranians, 14% for Syrians, and 13% for Sudanese (Libya and Yemen have sent negligible numbers of refugees). Somalian refugees are also more likely to be Muslim (99.7%, versus about 60% for Iraq and just 5% for Iran) and fighting-age males (27.4%, versus 25.4% for Iraq, 27.2% for Iran, 18% for Syria). Somalia is a far less modernized and urban country than Syria, Iraq, or Iran, and so the transition to life in America is more jarring.Somalian refugees have also seemed to form tighter-knit ethnic communities than many other groups, creating Somalian neighborhoods. These are all risk factors for terrorism.

That said, it remains the case that better than 99.99% of Somalian refugees have never undertaken any hostile action against the United States government, and no Somalian refugee has killed an American in a terrorist attack. It should also be noted, many Somali refugees are active participants with the FBI and DHS in rooting out violent Islamic jihad at home and abroad; indeed it is likely there are more Somalian refugees working for or with American security agencies than with terror organizations.

Sean Spicer Is Right. Women And Children Could Be Terrorists,"At Monday’s White House press conference a reporter asked spokesman Sean Spicer about a report that a five-year-old boy was detained at Virginia’s Dulles Airport because of the president’s temporary travel ban, calling into question Spicer’s statement that the ban is necessary to protect American citizens from threats.

Spicer’s response is sure to ruffle feathers: Everyone needs to be vetted from seven countries President Obama had earlier targeted with travel restrictions “to make sure, if there is a five-year-old, that they’re with their parents and that they don’t pose a threat. But to assume that just because of someone’s age or gender, or whatever, that they don’t pose a threat would be misguided and wrong.”

He’s exactly right, despite those who say advocates of the ban are afraid of widows and orphans, as Obama said about GOP politicians who supported such measures back in 2015. Instead of banning women and children, some suggest we let them in and ban only the men—because they’re the real threat, right? Wrong. We know from a great deal of evidence that women and children are involved in terrorist attacks. Even babies are used as cover for terror.

‘Even Women Must Fight’

Just last week, Nigerian officials warned that “babies are terrorists’ newest weapon.”

Female suicide bombers carrying infants set off explosive devices in Madagali on Jan. 13 after they were let through a security checkpoint where they were mistaken for civilians, the BBC reported. The women killed themselves, two babies and four others. The women — believed to be from the homegrown Islamic extremist group Boko Haram — could signal a horrifying trend of terrorists using infants in order to avoid detection prior to attacks.

That incident “came just two weeks after two teenage girls blew themselves up and injured three civilians at a checkpoint outside Madagali.” As I wrote back in 2015, female suicide bombers and the use of children aren’t freak occurrences.

Since the 1980s, women have accounted for nearly a quarter of attacks in several countries, including Iraq, Egypt, and Israel. Some research indicates that since 2002 women have carried out 50 percent of suicide attacks in Sri Lanka, Turkey, and Chechnya. According to an article in the Los Angeles Times that calls these attackers “Terror’s ‘invisible women,’” “a younger generation of female jihadists has come to believe that acts of violence can be just as liberating politically and spiritually for women as for men. A religious woman can deflect her parents’ or husband’s objections by invoking the name of religion, which trumps all. The new mantra is ‘even women must fight.’”

The Center for American Progress has written that America’s ability to deal with this radicalization is woefully inadequate, making for a gaping hole in U.S. counterterrorism strategy: “terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda and the Taliban continue to exploit uniquely female motivations as a tool to recruit female suicide bombers to attack U.S. soldiers and international aid workers.”

‘The Role of Women Within ISIS Is Increasingly Important’

The fact is, female suicide terrorists are on the rise, and it’s becoming “increasingly important to acknowledge and address this threat to American lives and interests.” In September last year, French police arrested three women planning a terror attack on a Paris train station. Another incident that same month also involved a woman, who was charged in a plot to blow up Paris’s Notre Dame Cathedral.

In Nigeria last year, three female bombers entered a safe haven camp “disguised as displaced persons” and killed 58 people. Two of the young women set off their explosives, but the third didn’t when she realized her parents and siblings were among the intended victims.

Jihad experts in Europe issued a warning last summer that “nearly 300 ‘highly educated and tough,’ radicalized French women are currently in Syria with the Islamic State, plotting attacks on their return to Europe.” “Out of the 700 French nationals currently fighting alongside ISIS in Syria, 275 are women. Jihad experts have warned that these women are often better educated than the men, and are more knowledgeable about Islam.”

According to sociologist and Islam expert Farhad Khosrokhavar, “A teenager can become radicalized in less than 10 days.” “Many young women are ‘naïve’ and truly believe that joining an insurgent group like ISIS is ‘exotic’ and in support of a ‘humanitarian cause’, said Mr Khosrokhavar.”

Islamologist Mathieu Guidère agreed, saying “the role of women within ISIS is becoming ‘increasingly important.’” They are also becoming more common the West as ISIS has issued new directives to enlist women. We saw this with the San Bernardino terrorist, Tashfeen Malik, a woman from Saudi Arabia who was following ISIS rules that allowed women to participate in jihad.

Women Are Very Successful Bombers

Terrorist organizations relish using women because they are extremely successful bombers.

Mia Bloom from the International Center for the Study of Terrorism attributes their success to several factors, most notably the fact that many people still do not expect women to be involved in violence. The common social assumption that women are inherently weaker, gentler, and more peaceful than men discounts their ability to engage in such lethal activity. That assumption allows female suicide terrorists to be overlooked by and escape through security inspections in many conflict zones, despite recent attempts to correct this security lapse.

Their attacks are also more lethal. They’re able to more easily reach high-profile targets and carry out more assassinations because of the lack of security focus. For example, “Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s 1991 assassination by a Tamil Tiger female suicide bomber, who was close enough to touch his feet when the bomb went off, shows how much closer women can get to their targets in many scenarios.”

These unique capabilities are probably why women are responsible for 65 percent of all assassinations among groups that use female suicide terrorists, even though they only make up 15 percent of total suicide bombers in these same groups, according to Lindsey O’Rourke.

According to The New York Times, many woman want to join the ranks of ISIS: “Roughly 10 percent of its Western recruits are female, often lured by their peers through social media and instant messaging.”

Indeed, despite stereotypes about their domesticity and passivity — the idea that they must always be under men’s influence or tricked into joining — women are drawn to groups like the Islamic State by many of the same forces as men: adventure, inequality, alienation and the pull of the cause. Once there, they commit violence against other women, including as part of all-female brigades enforcing female morality codes requiring modest dress and sex segregation. They operate checkpoints and go on home raids; they are also reportedly recruiters, trainers of female suicide bombers, wives and homemakers, fund-raisers and propagandists. They also help sanitize the group’s image by posting photos of themselves drinking milkshakes on Instagram and writing chatty, lighthearted tweets.

The article makes the point that we need to shift our gender stereotypes about the threats of women from terrorist regions. “Terrorists are strategic about using women, in increasingly chilling ways. To fight them, we have to move past simplistic assumptions about gender and terror and get serious about helping women and girls who are on this deadly path, as well as their would-be victims.”

This Extends to Children, Too

Sadly, even children are being radicalized. As I wrote previously, “In Nigeria, four women blew themselves up and a ten-year-old girl with an explosive belt was taken into police custody. CBS News has reported that ‘It is difficult to know how many children have been trained in Iraq and Syria, but there have been reports the number in recent months is in the hundreds.’”

It’s a tactic the Taliban and other terrorist networks have perfected, recruiting children to kill as they yell, ‘Allahu Akbar.’ PBS has reported as recently as this week that children and teens are being trained as ISIS suicide bombers. ‘It’s also a record of one particularly disturbing way the group is trying to expand its influence: training children and teenagers to become the next generation of jihadis,’ PBS writes. The children who are being trained are sometimes as young as five years old. This ISIS video is a disturbing picture of what we’re facing on the terrorist front. It shows lines of young children participating in drills and chanting verses from the Quran.

As reported in the Huffington Post, child suicide bombings are on the rise.

A study in February for Combating Terrorism Center at West Point military academy that examined Islamic State propaganda on child and youth ‘martyrs’ between January 2015 and 2016, found three times as many suicide operations involving children over the year. ‘They represent an effective form of psychological warfare—to project strength, pierce defenses, and strike fear into enemy soldiers’ hearts,’ the study said. ‘Islamic State is mobilizing children and youth at an alarming rate.’

The Daily Mail reported in 2015 that ISIS has been kidnapping children to brainwash them into becoming suicide bombers. They are taken to bases in Iraq and Syria for training. A 12-year-old boy was caught before blowing himself up in Iraq, terrified but determined to carry out his task. Here are pictures of him bursting into tears when police removed his explosive belt.

The unsettling truth, though, is far more unpalatable. For there is no denying that these children know they are wearing an explosive vest and have been given clear instructions and training regarding who to target and how to cause as many casualties as possible.

In Germany, a 12-year-old local German-Iraqi boy had been radicalized to set off a bomb in his hometown. “The stalkers of the so-called Islamic State have been searching out, grooming and inciting young terrorists in France and Germany for more than a year now,” the report said. “According to the German broadcaster WDR, the boy received instructions for building the bomb via the messenger app Telegram.”

Terrorists Will Exploit Known Loopholes

The effort to use women and children is insidious. Certainly, most are not a threat. That is not the point. The same is true of all immigrants and refugees. Most are peaceful. However, when it comes to bringing unknown refugees and immigrants into the United States from hostile regions that are now training young children and women to be terrorists—and using babies as cover—would it not be wise to vet them as thoroughly as we can?

We simply can’t discern the good from the bad without more information, especially regarding women and children. We must do what we can to determine if they are who they say they are. Is this lacking compassion? Is this not wise? Is a temporary ban that offers exceptions in extreme cases so inhuman?

While many Americans want to show compassion by opening our borders and often cite religious reasons for it, it is not the job of our government to be the savior of the world. President Trump’s first duty and priority is the safety and security of the American people. When we don’t know who the enemy is, it is our government’s duty to do everything it can to find out. This includes vetting anyone who could possibly be a threat.

A temporary ban for these purposes is not evil. It is not bigoted. It is not cruel. It is prudent and considerate as we seek to protect the lives of our loved ones while still doing everything we can to help others in genuine need. Our empathy extends to those seeking refuge, but it also extends to our fellow citizens, our family, our friends, and our neighbors here at home. They deserve a safe haven, too.

Why It’s Wrong To Compare Terrorist Attacks To Generic Gun Violence,"On Friday, an Egyptian man armed with two machetes attacked a group of security guards patrolling the Louvre Museum in Paris. The man, who yelled “allahu akbar” during the attack, was shot and taken to the hospital. Thankfully, no one was killed. The attack still terrified Parisians and many across the West. Why? Because of the attacker’s intent and our own vulnerability in our day to day lives.

Since President Trump signed his executive order on immigration two weeks ago, social media has been flooded with memes and graphs showing how few people have died at the hands of immigrants from Muslim-majority countries who’ve committed acts of terrorism. The Left uses this narrative to argue that we don’t need to worry about Middle Eastern terrorism or refugees coming into the country.

But this misunderstands, on a deep level, the psychology of terrorism and the importance of intention.

Terrorism Aims to Destabilize Society

Statistics about terrorism are often accompanied by the number of gun deaths that occur every year. This is a typical tactic of the Left. Whenever Islamist terrorism comes up, they change the conversation to guns and gun control.

There’s no doubt that gun violence in America is out of control. But comparing terrorism to gun violence misses the importance of intention, and how strongly it affects peoples’ sense of security. This is at the root of why terrorism frightens people so much.

It matters whether your potential attacker is trying to steal money from you, or is trying to kill you in the name of religion. The result might be the same tragic end, but the American public senses that there’s something infinitely more sinister about being the victim of a plot versus being the victim of a crime. And that’s what these ISIS-inspired attacks are: a plot.

The New York Times recently reported that many of the so-called lone wolf attacks that we’ve seen over the past few years were really coordinated by operatives in Syria. They aren’t just random, unrelated acts of violence by isolated, mentally ill individuals, as the mainstream media would have us believe. They are part of a broader strategy that is rooted in the religio-political ideology of Islamism.

That’s why we treat terrorism differently from a law enforcement point of view. Because it’s directed not just at murdering our citizens, but also at destabilizing our country. Gun violence is a terrible problem. But its perpetrators aren’t trying to destroy our way of life. And they aren’t working in a coordinated effort. That is what scares people.

Terrorism Makes People Feel Helpless

And people are afraid. In 2016, a survey on what Americans fear most found that terrorism filled the number two and number four slots, even though the chances of being the victim of terrorism is miniscule. But that’s not why people are afraid. They’re scared because there’s a sense that it could happen anywhere, anytime.

For the most part, a person can avoid going into a bad neighborhood, or dealings with criminals. This might help decrease their chance of being the victim of gun violence or a knife attack or a mugging.

But there’s nothing they can do to mitigate their likelihood of being the victim of a terror attack. Terrorist attacks feel random. For most people, that is scarier than almost anything else.

A study in the 1980s examined what influences peoples’ sense of how much danger they’re in. It found that a lack of control over a situation will inflate a person’s perception of risk. The study similarly found that uncertainty had the same effect. Being unsure about what’s going to happen and knowing we’re helpless to prevent it increases how afraid we are.

What the D.C. Sniper Showed Us About Random Violence

I was in Washington, D.C. visiting my brother and sister when the D.C. sniper was on the loose. People were terrified. The sniper could strike anywhere. There didn’t seem to be a pattern to whom or where he struck. There was nothing you could do to improve your odds. (Although my sister and I may have run in zig-zags leaving a metro station in Arlington to improve our chances.)

This is the same mentality behind the fear of terrorism—even though, statistically, it’s virtually impossible that you will be the next victim. Their fear is compounded because they know that we live in a society that’s too politically correct to do much about it. They’re reminded of this every time the media rushes to blame anything but religious ideology whenever a terrorist attack occurs.

So, even though the Louvre attacker didn’t have a gun or a bomb, and could only have done so much damage before being stopped by police, it still shakes our sense of security. It reminds us how vulnerable we are as we go about our daily lives, and how easy it is for someone to take advantage of that.

It’s also a reminder that there is a cadre of people around the world who would kill us as soon as look at us. That’s a pretty scary prospect.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/02/07/wrong-compare-terrorist-attacks-generic-gun-violence/,2017-02-07
SNL’S Kellyanne Conway Sketch Shows The Left’s Empathy Gap,"Over the weekend, Saturday Night Live aired a Kellyanne Conway sketch that turned out to be very controversial, even for journalists who are generally very anti-Trump in their signaling. The depiction of Conway as a Fatal Attraction sex fiend obsessed with the limelight and furious at being closed off from CNN isn’t funny, it’s just disturbing – even if you don’t know her or her family. But the real indication here is in how quickly SNL moved from a depiction of Conway that was considered empathetic and showed a harried family woman who couldn’t escape the crazy demands of working for Donald Trump to a crazed lunatic obsessed with getting in front of a camera. It’s a total inversion of their earlier sketches, and it shows what happens when partisanship totally skews the perspective comedians have on the characters they’re mocking.

The saddest part about this moment is how revealing it is of the illiberalism of some pockets of American society. There was no mass breakdown in feelings of neighborhood in the past several elections. Republicans did not like losing in 2012 or 2008, Democrats did not like losing in 2004 or 2000, but it would be hard to find reports of the losing side being so petty and vindictive toward supporters of the victor. See instead the scene today, where Washington, D.C. leftists are screening out Trump supporters in ads for roommates, housing laws be damned.

In one recent ad, a couple in the area who identified themselves as “open-minded” and liberal advertised a 500 dollar room in their home: ‘If you’re racist, sexist, homophobic or a Trump supporter please don’t respond. We won’t get along.’



In another, two women in their 20s were searching for a roommate to take over a lavender-colored room in their Columbia Heights apartment for 550. The women detailed their love of happy hours, a ‘good Netflix sesh,’ pho and tacos. ‘We’re open to any age/gender identity/non-identity,’ they added, ‘so long as you didn’t vote for Trump.’

Stella Morabito explains that what this is really about is years of historical revisionism in our education system.

We need to ask ourselves: What brought us to this place where the losing side has so utterly and violently rejected the peaceful transfer of power from one president to another, and previously agreed-upon electoral process and rules? It’s past time to ponder the quote from Thomas Jefferson: ‘If a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be.’



Let’s face it. Today’s street theater is the culmination of decades of radical education revision. The radical Left’s systematic attack on the study of Western Civilization has essentially been an attack against the study of any and all civil societies. It is an attack on the features that make a society civil and free. Those features include freedom of expression, civil discourse, the Socratic method of figuring out truth, value of the individual, and a common knowledge of the classics of history and literature that help us understand what’s universal in the human experience. All of that had to go.



Now, as we see students marching to demonize as ‘fascists’ proponents of free speech, their ignorance is in full view. This is really a full frontal attack on the rule of law, the Constitution, and a system of checks and balances that guards against the consolidation of centralized power.

The irony of a situation where the left has no empathy for those who disagree with them is that this act of #resistance against Republicans and conservatives will only turn off those people who might otherwise be won over by a competing message. If your only political message is grievance, it does little to move others who do not share your grievance. If the only message is be like us or you’re a racist homophobe, then the conversation stops early. It’s only by being more open that you have the capacity to win others to your side. Leftists should be doing the opposite – they should be inviting Trump supporters as roommates and endeavoring to convince them of the rightness of progressive views. Instead, by slamming the door in their face, it just convinces Trump supporters that the modern left is illiberal, intolerant, and only interested in associating with their own kind.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/02/13/snl-kellyanne-conway-sketch-shows-the-lefts-empathy-gap/,2017-02-13
Riot-Prone Mobs Are A Product Of America’s Cult-Like Education System,"There will be more street theater in the days to come. Every week after President Trump’s inauguration, the headlines have been full of protests: at local townhalls for GOP members of Congress, campus events, counter-protesting pro-life demonstrations. If you are of sound mind and watched the anti-Trump demonstrations unfold on Inauguration Day, then during the recent anti-speech riots at the Cal Berkeley and New York University campuses, two developments probably stood out to you.

First, you could see how violent rioters systematically infiltrated and punctuated those purportedly “largely peaceful” protests. I dare say, the Black Bloc presence and body language looks eerily similar that of ISIS terrorists, right down to the black hoods and masks.

Second, there is a particularly cult-like feel to the behavior of these mobs: the incoherence, blind rage, encouragement of lawlessness, and utter hostility to anyone who doesn’t conform to their mindset. It’s an anger sustained by vilification tactics reminiscent of the “two minutes hate” in Orwell’s novel “1984.”

Rather than acting as individuals who exercise rational thought, participants in these mobs act more like atomized parts of manufactured hives. They have been deployed at the drop of a hat—at airports, town halls, campuses—no doubt to create the illusion of mass resistance to a duly elected president and his administration. Such mobs are also aggressively pre-packing and swarming town halls of GOP members of Congress in solidly GOP districts.

To what purpose? The professed hope, as stated by founding member of the Revolutionary Communist Party of the USA Carl Dix as well as Princeton University professor Cornel West, who are founders of the Soros-funded group refusefascism.org, is to mobilize “tens of millions” of resisters into the streets to bring down the Trump administration. Sen. Tim Kaine recently lent them his relatively moderate voice by calling for people to resist the Trump administration “in the streets.” Former President Obama gave them a shout-out as well.

If aggressive mobs can deploy enough warm bodies through their organized pyramid scheme of recruitment, the reasoning goes, then law enforcement will be overwhelmed and have to throw in the towel. Or maybe what’s left of civil society will devolve to civil war.

We’re In an Ideological Cold War

Those who are pushing for sustained street resistance seem to be banking on two things. First they are betting that mainstream Americans won’t realize until it’s too late that we are in the midst of a virtual civil war that could turn violent. Dennis Prager recently wrote of this Second Civil War, warning Americans to wake up to it. Second, agitators are also wagering that Americans will not have the stomach for the prolonged fight they intend to bring to the streets, a point noted by psychologist Tim Daughtry in his book “Waking the Sleeping Giant.”

So is this some kind of a joke? Revolution in the streets of America that overturns the election results? So far it all sounds so goofy, at least where it doesn’t get violent. We can watch in wonder as a shrieking NYU professor verbally assaults numerous police officers with the sort of impunity only afforded to the far-left. We can assure ourselves that there aren’t that many irrational people. Even if true, however, that’s beside the point. Too many citizens are at sea in understanding what freedom even means.

We need to ask ourselves: What brought us to this place where the losing side has so utterly and violently rejected the peaceful transfer of power from one president to another, and previously agreed-upon electoral process and rules? It’s past time to ponder the quote from Thomas Jefferson: “If a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be.”

Destroying Our Education System Got Us Here

Let’s face it. Today’s street theater is the culmination of decades of radical education revision. The radical Left’s systematic attack on the study of Western Civilization has essentially been an attack against the study of any and all civil societies. It is an attack on the features that make a society civil and free. Those features include freedom of expression, civil discourse, the Socratic method of figuring out truth, value of the individual, and a common knowledge of the classics of history and literature that help us understand what’s universal in the human experience. All of that had to go.

Now, as we see students marching to demonize as “fascists” proponents of free speech, their ignorance is in full view. This is really a full frontal attack on the rule of law, the Constitution, and a system of checks and balances that guards against the consolidation of centralized power.

That’s the whole point of the education these students have been fed. In fact, a lot of 1960s agitators, including domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, decided to place their bets on radical education revision. For at least 40 years, Ayers has been devoted to transforming schools from places of actual education to places of coercive thought reform. As Andrew McCarthy recently pointed out in National Review: “It was a comfy fit for him and many of his confederates, once it dawned on them that indoctrination inside the schoolhouse was more effective than blowing up the schoolhouse.”

If you review the history of radical education reform, it’s clear these agitators have been committing mind arson on the children, undermining their ability to think independently and clearly. (For more on this, read Robin Eubanks’ book “Credentialed to Destroy.”)

How to Short-Circuit a Child’s Thinking

Radical education reformers have made a point of removing context from children’s education, and to squash their natural curiosity, undermining their capacity to think. They have done this in five ways: 1) by withholding the basic tools and codes of learning, such as suppressing phonics for reading, as well as clarity in standard arithmetic; 2) by withholding the content knowledge necessary to connect dots in understanding history and civics; 3) by withholding and demeaning literature that reveals universal human experiences and shared understanding, such as the classics and Shakespeare; 4) by de-stabilizing a child’s sense of self and identity. This is a natural byproduct of de-sexing every child, which happens through mandates to teach kids about transgenderism; and 5) by promoting relational aggression against any child or parent who might resist this totalitarian program. Radical education reform encourages schools and communities to single out those who disagree with this coercive program as misfits, bigots, or religious nuts.

All of the above would subvert anybody’s ability to think clearly. It leaves children unmoored from reality and in a constant state of anxiety about being socially rejected by peers or teachers for thinking thoughts deemed wrong. Their personal relationships are dictated and controlled according to their adherence to the party line of the radical ed reformers. Who wouldn’t be in a state of confusion after churning his way for 13 years through such a system of merciless indoctrination?

Without a grasp of history, students end up with a gaping memory hole, left adrift whenever trying to fill in the blank, trying to understand cause-and-effect of human events not as they actually happened, but according to the politicized scripts they’ve been assigned to memorize. So instead of really learning the context of what happened during the American Civil War—for example, a full account of history’s chain of events and the interactions of the real human figures—they are primarily fed a political gruel that triggers in them hyper-emotional reflexes to words like “confederate flag” or “Jefferson Davis Highway.”

The ability to think clearly and independently relies entirely on a foundation of context and a shared reality with others, as well as an openness to free inquiry. All are now sadly lacking.

Stoking Relational Aggression

Sex education in the schools has become a platform for Planned Parenthood to push its abortion agenda and encourage kids to have sex, which really just adds up to another assault on their privacy. The program to de-sex children by feeding them the lie of gender ideology and insisting their biological sex isn’t real only adds to a lack of context, causing confusion and loss of moorings as they try to adapt to being forced to think of themselves as the other sex, or having fluid identities, or no identity at all.

On top of all of this, America’s politicized public schools dictate a culture that inculcates resentments, labelling, and guilt-mongering in Maoist fashion. It’s bound to have a destabilizing effect on a child’s development. By high school too many are become dependent upon their overlords in the education establishment telling them what to say, what to believe, what to do: Go into the streets to protest Trump’s inauguration! Vote Dem! Here’s some condoms, go have sex! Viva abortion! If you ever get married, expect to get divorced. Get a degree in pseudo-studies. Don’t read classics (Eeewwww, dead white guys.)

America’s politicized public schools dictate a culture that inculcates resentments, labelling, and guilt-mongering in Maoist fashion.

Now picture these kids at college, away from home for the first time. What do they get? Relational aggression in hyperdrive. Relational aggression can be defined as a type of aggression that is “intended to harm others through deliberate manipulation of their social standing and relationships.” Ironically, so much of the socialization kids seem to experience in schools cultivates that feeling of separation and isolation from others, or the constant threat of it.

Increasingly colleges are requiring “diversity” training for freshmen, which basically puts them on notice that they will become non-persons if they say one wrong word or think one wrong thought. (For more on this dark side of campus culture, see the book just published by humanities professor Robert Oscar Lopez.)

The thought policing goes into high gear in programs that indoctrinate young people with privilege theory, basically telling them that growing up in a happy family is a sign of unearned “white” privilege that hurts kids who didn’t get the experience of a family vacation, or what have you. Basically, radical education reforms have been training students to hate their parents, their heritage, or anyone who doesn’t get with the program. It all adds up to an elaborate game of cooties. So you can graduate from college only to face a rehash of the schoolyard. And it gets worse.

Priming Cannon Fodder for an Ideological War

The last 50 years have produced a huge wave of kids who are functionally uneducated, even if they’re at the top in their class at elite schools. So many are unable to think independently, lack context, and try mightily to adapt to various PC lines. All of the above must be like living in a fog, or floating in the cold depths of outer space with nothing to hold on to. It’s bound to weaken relationships, and create the loneliness epidemic we are seeing in today’s society.

The last 50 years have produced a huge wave of kids who are functionally uneducated, even if they’re at the top in their class at elite schools.

They have learned through their environmental studies, non-stop identity politics, and a steady diet of hostility towards Christianity that if they want to be accepted, they must bow to the politically correct formula. After so much indoctrination and propaganda, a human being becomes highly malleable and vulnerable to a cult mindset.

Indeed, cults operate by disrupting recruits’ capacity to think independently and clearly. So it is always key to isolate their victims and to induce self-censorship of different viewpoints. Because political correctness stands in the way of free speech, it stands in the way of real conversation — and friendship.

What do we have at the end of this half-century process? Voila! Cannon fodder for violent demonstrations, untrained athletes in a foot race to societal suicide.

The Differences Between Real and Cultish Education

Margaret Thaler Singer was perhaps the twentieth century’s most eminent expert on cults. If you want to understand just how vulnerable humans are to coercive thought reform, read her book “Cults in Our Midst: The Hidden Menace in Our Everyday Lives.” If you don’t have time, you should at least look at these two pages that include her table showing how real education differs from four other methods of persuasion and influence.

The five methods on the “Continuum of Influence and Persuasion” are: education, advertising, propaganda, indoctrination, and thought reform (i.e., brainwashing). Look at the table, please. Singer describes how each method of persuasion operates in terms of openness, ethics, deceptiveness, structure, methods, and so on.

Real education does not have a propaganda component. It is not in any way deceptive. It takes raw information from a variety of bodies of knowledge and lays them out for learning and discussion. The exchanges are open, and do not depend on spouting forth a politically correct answer.

You’ll see how advertising, propaganda, and indoctrination vary in a number of ways. But on the far end of the scale is thought reform. This is another term for brainwashing, or the process of coercive persuasion. It is a closed method of persuasion. It is one-sided and takes place without the subject’s knowledge of the intent to reshape his or her mind. This exactly how cults operate on their recruits.

This calculated deception to prevent someone’s awareness that there’s an agenda to program his thoughts is the number one hallmark of cultish thought reform.

The purpose of the recruit is to be deployed to recruit others, all to promote the cult leaders’ agenda. Cults operate like the Borg of Star Trek. Their goal is simply to keep growing with no end in sight, looking to absorb everyone into their mindset. The big problem today is that cults aren’t just your little scattered UFO clans. Rather, they seem to have taken on global proportions.

The tragic truth of radical education reform is that it has served only to get youth to adopt political views in accordance with the radical reformers’ goals. They obediently go out to these demonstrations or do door-to-door work for whatever power-consolidating agenda item serves the elites, because they have been conditioned to know that doing otherwise will get them socially rejected.

It’s all very Pavlovian and psychologically manipulative. They know the script, but can’t tell you what it all means because they lack the context, the capacity to think independently of the threats of political correctness. And it all happened without them knowing what hit them or their families really knowing either. This calculated deception to prevent someone’s awareness that there’s an agenda to program his thoughts is the number one hallmark of cultish thought reform. (Not incidentally, Singer was defamed for advocating that the public become aware of how coercive persuasion works so people could develop countermeasures.)

We Live in the Age of the Cult Mindset

I don’t think it’s fair to call these recruits “snowflakes,” because the triggering mechanisms were implanted into them largely through education reforms that stifle the natural curiosity of children and manipulate the universal human fear of social rejection. They are more like prisoners, victims of mind-hacking. It’s like they’ve been intellectually knee-capped.

Even if you don’t agree that college campuses have a rape culture, there can be no denying that many have developed a mind rape culture. In the end, many of these students are ripe to serve as recruits for the “resistance,” promoting an agenda to bring about a system that rejects, in perpetuity, the right to think for oneself and speak freely.

If Americans ever fully regain an appreciation of the rule of law and their Bill of Rights, future historians might just peg this era as the Age of the Cult Mindset. Perhaps you know a lot of folks who are not stuck in the delusional thinking. Yet all it takes to induce a scary Twilight Zone scenario on whole populations is a few obsessive-compulsive control freaks who have reins of power, an organizing infrastructure, and the iron will to make puppets of us all.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/02/13/todays-riot-prone-mobs-product-americas-cult-like-education-system/,2017-02-13
"When Obama’s National Security Advisor Lied, Media Laughed","Buried deep beneath the Michael Flynn hysteria this week was Judicial Watch’s release of newly obtained State Department documents related to the Benghazi terrorist attack on September 11, 2012. One email confirms—again—that the Obama administration knew the day after the attack it was not a random act of violence stemming from an anti-Muslim video. That was the excuse shamefully propagated by top Obama administration officials (including the president himself) and swallowed whole by a media establishment desperate to help Obama win re-election six weeks later.

According to the summary of a call on September 12, 2012 between State Department Under-Secretary Patrick Kennedy and several congressional staffers, Kennedy was asked if the attack came under cover of protest: “No this was a direct breaching attack,” he answered. Kennedy also denied the attack was coordinated with the protests in Cairo over the video: “Attack in Cairo was a demonstration. There were no weapons shown or used. A few cans of spray paint.”

It’s somewhat ironic—galling?—that this email was disclosed the same day the anti-Trump universe was spinning into the stratosphere over Flynn’s resignation as President Trump’s national security advisor. It begs for a little trip down memory lane, to a kinder, gentler time when the media gave a great big pass to another national security advisor in the days after four Americans, including an ambassador, were murdered in Libya by Islamic terrorists under her watch.

Lying to Us Only Matters If We Dislike You

Fun fact: While Trump press secretary Sean Spicer fielded 55 questions on February 14 related to the Flynn debacle, Obama’s press secretary Jay Carney received only 13 questions from reporters on September 12, 2012, three of which were set-ups to blast Mitt Romney’s criticism of the administration after the attack. 55 to 13.

So as we now suffer through yet another patch of media mania, conspiracy theories, and unsubstantiated claims about how Trump hearts Russia, as well as the daily beatings endured by Spicer, let’s reminisce to when the media and Obama’s press flaks spun, deflected—even joked about golf and “Saturday Night Live!”—less than a week after Benghazi.

The day after Hillary Clinton’s deputy had that call with key Capitol Hill staffers, including advisors to senators Durbin, Feinstein, and McGaskill, to dispute the notion the attack was about an anti-Muslim video, here’s what Carney said: “I think it’s important to note with regards to that protest that there are protests taking place in different countries across the world that are responding to the movie that has circulated on the Internet. As Secretary Clinton said today, the United States government had nothing to do with this movie. We reject its message and its contents. We find it disgusting and reprehensible.”

On September 14, hours before the remains of the Benghazi victims would arrive at Andrews Air Force Base, Carney was still blaming the video. Just steps from the Oval Office, Carney opened his briefing with this: “First of all, we are obviously closely monitoring developments in the region today. You saw that following the incidents in response to this video, the president directed the administration to take a number of steps to prepare for continued unrest.”

Carney went on to mention the video/film/movie another 30 times during his briefing. He stuck with his story even after some reporters pushed back, citing other sources who said it was indeed a pre-mediated attack. One reporter said several senators admitted the “attack on Benghazi was a terrorist attack organized and carried out by terrorists, that it was premeditated, a calculated act of terror,” and asked Carney, “is there anything more you can — now that the administration is briefing senators on this, is there anything more you can tell us?”

Carney: “Again, it’s actively under investigation, both the Benghazi attack and incidents elsewhere. And my point was that we don’t have and did not have concrete evidence to suggest that this was not in reaction to the film. But we’re obviously investigating the matter…” Who cares, Sean Spicer called Justin Trudeau Joe, OMG!

Susan Rice’s Audacity of Trope

But of course nothing matches the audacity of trope by one of Obama’s top national security advisors, then-United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice, on September 16, 2012. Rice went on several Sunday shows to peddle a story she knew was completely phony, one that was already quickly unraveling even as most in the media and administration tried to keep it intact.

You can read most of her comments here, but Rice repeats the line that Benghazi attack was not premediated and was connected to the demonstrations in Cairo over the video (a document obtained by Judicial Watch last year shows Hillary Clinton met with Rice a few days before her television appearances). Which presidential administration is fact-challenged, again?

In a press gaggle on Air Force One the next day, guess how many times Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest was asked about Rice’s comments? Ten? Five? One? Not once. Let me repeat that. The day after an Obama national security advisor was on five news programs to blame a terrorist attack on a YouTube video, not one reporter asked the White House about it. I actually had to re-read the transcripts several times, even checking the date over and over, to make sure this was accurate. Her name did not even come up.

No discussion about the investigation. No discussion about emerging evidence from around the world that Benghazi was indeed a terrorist attack. (The only time it was mentioned was when Jen Psaki criticized Mitt Romney’s comments about how the administration handled Benghazi and questioned whether he was ready for “primetime.”)

Here’s what they did discuss: Debate prep, Occupy Wall Street, and the Chicago’s teachers strike. An actual human reporter asked this: “It was a beautiful weekend for golf and he wasn’t out on the course. Is it safe to assume maybe he was doing some preparation at the White House?” WHAT? Then they joked about football and “Saturday Night Live.”

Sometimes the hypocrisy, double standard, and outright lies by the media under the Trump presidency is funny. Sometimes it is infuriating. But never was the media’s complicit sheep-like coverage more evident than it the days after Benghazi, behavior you can never imagine now. They have yet to admit their mistakes and failures, even as more evidence is revealed.

Remember that the next time you want to worry about how Trump is responsible for undermining the media’s integrity and credibility.

Correction: This article previously implied Rice was held the national security advisor title at the time of the Benghazi attack. At the time she was a national security advisor who served on Obama’s National Security Council, but took that specific title in July 2013.

"ISIS Is Retreating In Syria And Iraq, But It’s Nowhere Near Over","ISIS is losing more and more territory in Syria and Iraq, but what about its holdings elsewhere in the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia? As ISIS continues to be squeezed by Iraqi, Syrian, and Turkish forces, it may look to these regions as places to regroup or form a kind of backup caliphate. We should also expect it to continue changing its tactics as it tries to survive.

The U.S.-led coalition in Iraq is continuing to push ISIS out of Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, after moving into eastern Mosul last month. Last week, Iraqi forces took over the Mosul airport and began to move into the western half of the city, where they have already retaken one neighborhood. Although western Mosul is expected to pose more of a challenge, Iraqi officials predict the battle for Mosul will be over by the summer.

As ISIS’ territorial control weakens in Iraq, the Iraqi air force launched airstrikes across the border for the first time last Friday, a sign of its resolve to destroy the group. Meanwhile, ISIS is losing control of its stronghold in northern Syria as it faces losses on multiple fronts. Turkish-backed Syrian rebels routed the Islamic State from the strategic city of al-Bab, while over the weekend, Syrian forces took neighboring territories held by ISIS.

These victories have come with setbacks, of course. Although Iraqi officials declared eastern Mosul “liberated” last month, ISIS sleeper cells have continued to launch attacks there and the group is using increasingly sophisticated drones to drop grenades on civilians and aid workers. Residents also report that neighborhoods that were supposedly cleared still contain many ISIS sympathizers. In response to losing al-Bab, ISIS retaliated with car bombs late last week that killed more than 60 people. ISIS is also engaging guerrilla warfare. In February, ISIS detonated a car bomb in the Shiite suburb of Sadr city outside Baghdad that killed at least 48 people.

The Sinai Peninsula

ISIS set up shop in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula in late 2014, under the moniker ISIS-Sinai Province, or just Sinai Province. In October 2015, the group bombed a Russian airliner on its way to the resort town Sharm-el-Sheikh, killing all 224 on board. Sinai Province is violently opposed to the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who banned the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood after coming into office.

Sinai Province is allied with Hamas, a Muslim Brotherhood offshoot, working together on smuggling tunnels running from Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula. This has led to an unusual level of cooperation between the Egyptian government and Israel. In return for choking Hamas tunnel access to Egypt, the Israelis have been helping the Egyptian military fight Islamic State on the Sinai Peninsula. ISIS has launched several rocket attacks into Israel, including twice last month.

Last week, Islamic State released a video instructing its followers in the Sinai Peninsula to target Coptic Christians. Several Copts have been killed in the last ten days, causing 118 Coptic families to flee the region since last Thursday. In December, an ISIS suicide bomber targeted a Coptic cathedral in Cairo, killing 25.

Pakistan and Afghanistan

Pakistan and Afghanistan are experiencing increasing problems with ISIS as the group has worked to expand its presence in Southeast Asia. The ISIS affiliate, ISIS-Khorasan Province, or ISIS-KP, claimed responsibility for the bombing of a Sufi shrine last month in Pakistan that killed 88 people, as well as a similar bombing in November that killed 50.

ISIS-KP emerged in Pakistan and Afghanistan in early 2015. Its leadership is comprised mainly of Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TPP) and Afghan Taliban defectors. Their base is in Afghanistan, although the porous border between the two countries allows militants to pass easily back and forth. Pakistan has accused Afghan officials of refusing to take action against the group and has taken punitive actions like closing border crossings that are key to trade between the two countries. Although long reluctant to admit ISIS’ presence in Pakistan, officials finally acknowledged in September that the group poses a serious threat to the country.

ISIS has been trying to establish a caliphate in Nangarhar province in eastern Afghanistan, but according to the top U.S. general in Afghanistan, the group has lost control of several districts in that province over the past year. However, ISIS still poses a significant security threat as it continues to attack the military and Shiite communities. Last month alone, ISIS killed 17 Afghan soldiers, gunned down six Red Cross aid workers, and launched a suicide bomb outside of Afghanistan’s Supreme Court that killed at least 20 people. The United Nations reported that civilian casualties from ISIS attacks increased by a factor of ten from 2015 to 2016 in Afghanistan.

Libya

When ISIS emerged in 2014, it took advantage of the failed Libyan state to gain a foothold along its coast. Remember that after Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and murdered, the country descended into a violent civil war. ISIS’ stronghold was in Sirte, although it also held territory in Benghazi, Tobruk, and several other areas. It was on a Libyan beach that ISIS beheaded 21 Egyptian Christians in a graphic propaganda video.

After a seven-month-long campaign, which included U.S. airstrikes, ISIS was driven from Sirte. However, ISIS is still considered a threat. The group is thought to be regrouping in the desert, forming underground cells throughout the country, and continuing to attack the Libyan military and plotting attacks in Europe. In January, U.S. planes bombed two ISIS training camps, killing 80.

Yemen and Somalia

Much like in Libya, ISIS has taken advantage of the ongoing civil war in Yemen to insert itself and gain territory. The group continues to launch multiple suicide bombings and attack Yemeni military forces. ISIS is not as powerful nor does it hold as much territory as al-Qaeda does. However, as ISIS loses ground in Syria and Iraq, there is increasing concern that militants will join its affiliate in Yemen.

ISIS first emerged in Somalia in 2015 as a small group that broke away from al-Shabaab, the Islamist group loyal to al-Qaeda. Last fall, ISIS in Yemen briefly seized a town along the coast and last month attacked a hotel in the Puntland region. While their presence in Somalia is believed to be small and much inferior to that of al-Shabaab, Somalia is a de facto failed state and would be a relatively easy place for militants in Syria and Iraq to flee to and regroup.

This Is a Global War that Requires Global Cooperation

As ISIS continues to face territorial losses in Iraq and Syria, we should expect to see more drone attacks and suicide bombings in these two countries, much like al-Qaeda’s guerilla warfare tactics. We may also see ISIS look toward its holdings, both large and small, from Africa to Southeast Asia, as a way to reorganize and begin their project anew.

To defeat ISIS in these countries, or prevent their small presence from metastasizing, each country will need to have the resolve and the resources to pursue them aggressively. Quasi-failed states and countries bogged down in violent civil wars will struggle to do this. The United States must promote stability in these countries if we want to see ISIS’ influence and violence to come to an end.

Countries where ISIS has gained a foothold will also need to be open to coordination across the border. This will prove difficult for some, like Pakistan and Afghanistan, who have ongoing border disputes and are deeply distrustful of one another.

ISIS is a global problem and will require a global solution. This means stability, determination, and cooperation. It may also necessitate leadership from a major world power. But in today’s climate of populist nationalism, Western countries may be reluctant to come forward. Unfortunately, that leaves Russia and Iran to fill the void—unless and until the United States decides to take up its discarded mantle of leadership.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/03/01/isis-retreating-syria-iraq-nowhere-near/,2017-03-01
Feminists Can't Decide If Attacks On Kellyanne's Appearance Are Sexist,"To its credit, the New York Times printed an article this week about sexist attacks on President Trump’s adviser and former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway: “Sexist political criticism finds a new target: Kellyanne Conway.”

What powerful political woman is mocked for her clothes, is the target of pictures on Twitter depicting her as haggard and is routinely called a witch and a bitch? If you guessed Hillary Clinton, you’re right. But if you guessed Kellyanne Conway, you’re right, too.

The Times spoke with various feminists, political professionals, and scholars about attacks on Conway and how they parallel those made on other powerful women: The witch memes, the word-that-rhymes-with-witch memes, the attacks on their hair, skin, clothes and age.

Conway became the first female campaign manager to oversee a winning presidential campaign in 2016, but the most famous “tribute” is probably the “Saturday Night Live” portrayal of her in the unhinged stalker role from “Fatal Attraction” threatening journalists over screen time.

The way she sat on a sofa became an entire news cycle and subjected her to crass sexual jokes from at least one Democratic congressman, who eventually gave a qualified apology. To her credit, Chelsea Clinton called on him to apologize, while Rep. Nancy Pelosi punted.

There is some debate in feminist circles as to how much defending Conway deserves when she headed up a campaign for a man who is on record saying openly crass and sexist things. This is an evergreen debate about conservative women, whom many feminists believe, at best, stand on feminist shoulders to join with men to impede women’s progress.

“I think some of the reticence that might be coming across in not a huge chorus of defense …is the feeling that she doesn’t have our back,” said Gillian Thomas, a senior staff lawyer of the Women’s Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union. “It’s a shame,” Ms. Thomas continued. “If women were more united and speaking up at this behavior, including when it’s perpetrated by the left, we’d all be a lot better off.”

Feminist website Jezebel asks, “What Do Feminists Owe Kellyanne Conway?” With respect, it’s the wrong question. If feminists think Conway, a successful political professional, working mom, and entrepreneur in her own right long before she met Donald Trump, is a mere pawn of the patriarchy, why make the standards of behavior subject to her relationship to men they don’t like? You think there’s danger for women in a Trump presidency? Fine. The careers of Sen. Ted Kennedy and President Bill Clinton teach us there’s plenty of danger for women in changing the rules for behavior depending on the party of the perp.

As feminists know well, the sexist attacks wouldn’t disappear if she were liberal. Since when in feminist thought does the behavior of the victim mitigate the sins of the attacker?

The question is what feminists owe themselves, and intellectual consistency is a precious gift these days, more at a premium by the moment. Give that gift to yourself, like one of those diamond rings professional women buy themselves to subvert the expectations of the patriarchy.

Instead, in hubs of online feminism, there have been some painfully perfunctory denunciations of gross sexism. Take Slate’s parsing of model Emily Ratajkowski’s defense of first lady Melania Trump against accusations she’s a “hooker,” uttered by a New York Times reporter at a fashion event.

This one seems pretty cut-and-dried, and Ratajkowski’s tweets were just that.

Sat next to a journalist from the NYT last night who told me ""Melania is a hooker."" Whatever your politics it's crucial to call this out for — Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) February 13, 2017

what it is: slut shaming. I don't care about her nudes or sexual history and no one should. — Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) February 13, 2017

Gender specific attacks are disgusting sexist bullshit. — Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) February 13, 2017

A man with a considerable platform went after the first lady with the grossest of sexual and sexist accusations, and a woman with a platform called him out for it. Now, we all tweet slay, gurl, slay, right? Wrong.

So there you go: Don’t call anyone a hooker in the presence of Emily Ratajkowski, because she is not here for that. While protesting slut-shaming is a valid stance, if this seems like an annoying nontroversy, well, that might be an even more a valid stance. It’s not funny or amusing that a reporter saw fit to throw around the word hooker, but it’s also not clear that calling it out was the best use of Ratajkowski’s energies or platform.

This is Regina George feminism. It’s slut-shaming the shaming of slut-shaming. Keep your mouth shut, model, unless you’re saying exactly what I say you should in exactly the way I prescribe. You know, for solidarity. The piece acknowledges the apology of Jacob Bernstein in passing, the man who caused a “nontroversy” by calling the first lady a hooker in public, before moving on to nitpick Ratajkowski’s social media brand of “woke model.”

The headline attacks Ratajkowski for receiving thanks from Melania for defending her against charges she’s a “hooker,” saying it means “something is very wrong.” Something’s wrong, but it ain’t that.

In a better piece at Jezebel, we nonetheless find that feminists are pretty confused about very basic rules they have enforced for years. Like, don’t comment on the appearance of women in power, thus reducing them to a measure of their conformity to patriarchal beauty norms.

The latter rule is so strictly enforced, I was afraid during the primary season to say when Carly Fiorina looked utterly bangin’ in her sometimes delightfully unconventional clothes or compliment Hillary Clinton on a particularly flattering blazer.

With the same painfully perfunctory tone, like a toddler asked to apologize to her sister, the writer grudgingly does her “duty as a woman, [saying] Peterson is right, comparing Conway’s looks to Skeletor is sexist, boring, and cliché. There are undoubtedly ways to satirize Conway without resorting to traditional frames of misogyny; ways to delegitimize her power without bothering about her complexion.”

Do you sense a but? There’s a but. But, you see, the way Conway presents herself is itself a political message that must be combatted, therefore conveniently putting her appearance back on the table as valid political critique.

First, let me concede there’s a fine line when it comes to clothing. I don’t think it should be off-limits. It’s fun to talk about, it’s undeniably an important part of how women in the public eye present themselves, and it offers a pleasant contrast to the stultifying universe of men’s fashion choices, particularly in politics.

But the issue of Conway’s appearance—both her clothes (apparently it’s sexist to criticize her clothes) and her body—still remains.

Her body, too, huh? The idea that Conway’s choice to wear dresses and style her hair long makes her essentially a walking talking point for Trump’s worldview is nonsense. Oh, but we’re digging in:

“But there’s an odd framing of Conway’s appearance here as a politically neutral entity or, worse yet, a bold resistance of the expectations of an aging woman, feminist in its own right. But the presentation of the body, particularly Conway’s representation of herself as trenchantly feminine, is by no means neutral. Indeed, the body and the rhetoric that surrounds it is central to Trump’s worldview reflected in both speeches and policies. Trump’s political deployment of the body is, more so than the internet’s casual sexism, perhaps the greatest challenge to feminism.”

This is just pseudo-intellectualizing of “haha, what the F is Kellyanne Conway wearing?” or “she looks like a walk of shame today.” If you’re gonna go there, just, ahem, lean in.

I’m right-of-center, Trump-critical, often disagree with Conway, and I wear dresses and long hair. So do many liberal women in my line of work. Do trolls have license to go after my physical attributes because my embrace of “femininity,” which looks the same as my liberal colleague’s work clothes, perpetuates a patriarchal system of oppression? Is my sleeveless sheath just another arrow in my quiver of hegemony?

No, that’s just people wanting to find an excuse to make fun of women in the same ways men have made fun of women for years and pat themselves on the back for it.

The definition of feminism is technically clear, but the feminist movement is often not.

I’m not an expert, so I’ll quote someone who is. This criticism of Conway’s look sounds very much like the other side of the emasculating-powerful-woman attacks used on Hillary: “Whereas Hillary is called castrating or shrewish, Conway is often called a slut. The implication is that she is using femininity to control men,” Marjorie J. Spruill, author of “Divided We Stand: The Battle Over Women’s Rights and Family Values That Polarized American Politics” told the Times.

Feminist writers keep a running tally of starlets and pop stars who aren’t sure they want to identify as “feminist” when asked. Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, Kelly Clarkson, and even Beyonce have transgressed by being too uncertain about whether and how they embrace the label. The chorus of criticism ensues: “Why would you not embrace ‘feminism’? It just means equality of the sexes!”

The definition of feminism is technically clear, but the feminist movement is often not. It’s about equal treatment of the sexes until it’s about different standards for women. It’s about women and men being capable of all the same things unless it’s about the special circumstances for which women must be compensated. It’s about being empowered until it’s about a indecipherable hierarchy of privilege and victimhood. It’s about equality of the the genders until it’s about using the exact right verbiage to refer to the many other genders about which you may or may not have been briefed in the last three weeks (I’m not being flippant; it changes quickly). It’s about all women until it’s about a civil war between white feminists and WOC. It’s about the choice to treat one’s body as one wants until one’s choice is to wear a dress and work a job feminists don’t like. Or, work that job without wearing red on A Day Without a Woman.

These tepid denunciations of sexism, which morph into justifications of a more tepid form of sexism, are just another example of how the target is in constant motion for being a good feminist. I bet Ratajkowski thought she was safely in the right by denouncing a man who called the first lady a hooker, but she wasn’t.

This week alone, a female British TV and radio presenter denounced Emma Watson’s lovely Vanity Fair shoot in the name of feminism, telling her to put her breasts away if she’d like to have thoughts (to her credit, Gloria Steinem forcefully backed Watson). Media trumpeted the Brawny paper towels brand’s decision to put a woman on its packaging for Women’s History Month as part of its #StrengthHasNoGender campaign. Because someone was finally brave enough to make a woman the face of a household cleaning product! For progress. And on International Women’s Day, the feminist movement told women not to work outside the home.

Is it any wonder, when women are asked whether they’re “feminists,” they don’t know exactly what they’re committing to?

"Anti-Semitism Is Real, But The Sudden Concern Over It Is Fake News","On March 7, a unanimous U.S. Senate noted the spate of threats directed at Jewish institutions in the last several weeks, and asked the Trump administration to help them deal with their heightened security needs.

The request conveyed in a letter to two of President Trump’s cabinet secretaries represented a true national consensus about the egregious nature of these incidents. After initially being slow to react, the administration has consistently expressed its condemnation of these attacks. But partisans are still seeking to blame Trump for them, and the resulting attention has created something of a panic among some in the Jewish community.

There is no evidence these incidents represent anything but the actions of isolated individuals. And as former Anti-Defamation League head Abe Foxman pointed out, they don’t constitute a crisis. But it is also true that attacks on Jews have always accounted for the lion’s share of religion-based hate crimes, as documented by FBI statistics. The attention given to that chronic problem, which had been largely ignored in the mainstream media (especially when compared to the disproportionate focus on an alleged post-9/11 anti-Muslim backlash), ought to be welcomed.

The UN Has Never Showed True Support For Israel

But those who care about the issue (independent of the urge to pile on Trump) got a wakeup call the day after the congressional letter was sent. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights decided to weigh in on the issue in an address to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, and included a diatribe against Trump. When the UN—one of the world’s leading sources of incitement and hypocrisy about Jew hatred—thinks it safe to join the gang tackle of Trump on this issue, it’s clear that the great anti-Semitism scare of 2017 has officially jumped the shark.

UN High Commissioner Prince Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein gave a broad survey of international human rights problems in his address. But unsurprisingly, he devoted a disproportionate amount of time to attacking Israel and delegitimizing its right of self-defense. Just as egregious was his choice to criticize Trump and the United States alongside the enumeration of outrages committed in genuine tyrannies like Iran.

He demanded that the administration provide “greater and more consistent leadership” to deal with anti-Semitism—but that concern was slipped in alongside denunciations of U.S. immigration law enforcement, and alleged attempts by Trump to “intimidate” the press and the courts.

Using Anti-Semitism As A Weapon Against Trump Is Wrong

Trump’s comments about the media and judges who rule against him do him no credit. But Hussein’s statement failed to note that, unlike virtually every other country he had mentioned apart from democratic Israel, neither the freedom of the press nor the independence of American courts are in any danger.

At the same time, he appeared to argue that anyone who wished to cross into the U.S. had the right to do so—whether they had legal permission or not. It’s a standard no one would apply to any other nation in the world.

But while the UN attacks on Trump’s immigration stands were staggering in their hypocrisy, the fact that the prince felt free to throw in a mention of anti-Semitism is a clear sign that discussion of that issue has now slipped the bonds of rationality.

We All Ought To Condemn Hate, No Matter What

All persons of good will, regardless of their faith, ought to condemn hate and those who practice it. The willingness of some American Muslims to show solidarity with Jews at this time—as Jews have consistently done when Muslims were attacked in this country—should be welcomed.

But when people like Palestinian activist Linda Sarsour—who routinely engages in anti-Semitic attacks on Israel’s right to exist and to self-defense—start using anti-Semitism as a cudgel with which to attack Trump, sensible persons should realize what is going on. The same is true when the UNHRC, of all places, begins expressing concerns about anti-Semitism.

We should not stop caring about bomb threats at JCCs because a UN official mentions them in a forum frequently used for Jew-bashing. But this attention shift suggests the issue is being exploited for other purposes.

We’re Seeing A ‘Rising Tide Of Anti-Semitism’

President Trump has largely brought this on himself because of his willingness to engage in attacks on groups and individuals. But a “rising tide of anti-Semitism” is, as President Obama’s State Department noted, spreading across the globe. The issue is too important to be reduced to the level of a political football for the purpose of Trump-bashing.

When the UNHRC starts addressing the terrorist war on Israel’s existence, as well as attempts to deny the rights of Jews to their ancient homeland and holy places, then it can start lecturing the Jewish state’s only superpower ally about bomb threats at JCCs. The same is true of those who support a BDS (boycott, divest, sanction) movement that is part of a war on the Jewish people.

Those who are genuinely worried about anti-Semitism in the U.S. should regard the UN’s attention as a warning—a warning that the issue has been hijacked for purposes that have nothing to do with the security of their community.

Political Islam Is Today’s ‘Long March Through The Institutions’,"The following is an excerpt of the Hoover Institution publication “The Challenge of Dawa: Political Islam as Ideology and Movement and How to Counter It,” by Ayaan Hirsi Ali. You may read the full report here. ​ This excerpt was originally published in Defining Ideas. ​Copyright © 2017 by the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University.

It is refreshing and heartening that President Trump acknowledges the need for an ideological campaign against “radical Islam.” This deserves to be called a paradigm shift.

President Bush often referred to a “war on terror,” but terror is a tactic that can be used for a variety of ideological objectives. President Obama stated that he was opposed to “violent extremism” and even organized an international summit around this subject. Yet at times he made it seem as if he worried more about “Islamophobia” than about radical Islam.

In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in 2012, Obama declared: “The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam.” In what follows, however, I shall refer to “political Islam” rather than radical Islam.

Political Islam is not just a religion as most Western citizens recognize the term “religion,” a faith; it is also a political ideology, a legal order, and in many ways also a military doctrine associated with the campaigns of the Prophet Muhammad. Political Islam rejects any kind of distinction between religion and politics, mosque and state. Political Islam even rejects the modern state in favor of a caliphate. My central argument is that political Islam implies a constitutional order fundamentally incompatible with the U.S. Constitution and with the “constitution of liberty” that is the foundation of the American way of life.

Yes, Islamists Have Everything to Do with Islam

There is no point in denying that political Islam as an ideology has its foundation in Islamic doctrine. However, “Islam,” “Islamism,” and “Muslims” are distinct concepts. Not all Muslims are Islamists, let alone violent, but all Islamists—including those who use violence—are Muslims. I believe the religion of Islam itself is indeed capable of reformation, if only to distinguish it more clearly from the political ideology of Islamism. But that task of reform can only be carried out by Muslims.

Insisting that radical Islamists have “nothing to do with Islam” has led U.S. policy makers to commit numerous strategic errors since 9/11. One is to distinguish between a “tiny” group of extremists and an “overwhelming” majority of “moderate” Muslims. I prefer to differentiate among Medina Muslims, who embrace the militant political ideology adopted by Muhammad in Medina; Mecca Muslims, who prefer the religion originally promoted by Muhammad in Mecca; and reformers, who are open to some kind of Muslim Reformation.

These distinctions have their origins in history. The formative period of Islam can be divided roughly into two phases: the spiritual phase, associated with Mecca, and the political phase that followed Muhammad’s move to Medina. There is a substantial difference between Qur’anic verses revealed in Mecca (largely spiritual in nature) and Qur’anic verses revealed in Medina (more political and even militaristic). There is also a difference in the behavior of the Prophet Muhammad: in Mecca, he was a spiritual preacher, but in Medina he became a political and military figure.

It cannot be said often enough that the United States is not at war with Islam or with Muslims. It is, however, bound to resist the political aspirations of Medina Muslims where those pose a direct threat to our civil and political liberties. It is also bound to ensure that Mecca Muslims and reforming Muslims enjoy the same protections as members of other religious communities who accept the fundamental principles of a free society. That includes protection from the tactics of intimidation that are so central to the ideology and practice of political Islam.

Background on Today’s State of Affairs

The conflict between the United States and political Islam in modern times dates back to at least 1979, when the U.S. embassy in Tehran was seized by Islamic revolutionaries and 52 Americans were held hostage for 444 days. In the decades that followed, the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the 1998 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania reminded Americans of the threat posed by political Islam.

But it was not until the 9/11 attacks that political Islam as an ideology attracted sustained public attention. The September 11, 2001, attacks were inspired by a political ideology that has its foundation in Islam, specifically its formative period in Medina.

Since 9/11, at least $1.7 trillion has been spent on combat and reconstruction costs in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The total budgetary cost of the wars and homeland security from 2001 through 2016 is more than $3.6 trillion. Yet in spite of the sacrifices of more than 5,000 armed service personnel who have lost their lives since 9/11 and the tens of thousands of American soldiers who have been wounded, today political Islam is on the rise around the world.

Violence is the most obvious—but not the only—manifestation of this trend. Jihadist groups have proliferated all over the Middle East and North Africa, especially where states are weak and civil wars rage (Iraq, Libya, Somalia, and Syria, not forgetting northern Nigeria). Islam-inspired terrorists also have a global reach. France is in a permanent state of emergency, while the United States has been profoundly shaken by terror attacks in Boston (the Marathon bombers); Fort Hood, Texas; San Bernardino, California; Orlando, Florida; and Ohio State University, to name but a few.

Of the last 16 years, the worst year for terrorism was 2014, with 93 countries experiencing attacks and 32,765 people killed. The second worst was 2015, with 29,376 deaths. Last year, four radical Islamic groups were responsible for 74 percent of all deaths from terrorism: the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), Boko Haram, the Taliban, and al-Qaeda. Although the Muslim world itself bears the heaviest burden of jihadist violence, the West is increasingly under attack.

How large is the jihadist movement in the world? In Pakistan alone, where the population is almost entirely Muslim, 13 percent of Muslims surveyed—more than 20 million people—said that bombings and other forms of violence against civilian targets are often or sometimes justified in order to defend Islam from its enemies.

Disturbingly, the number of Western-born Muslim jihadists is sharply increasing. The United Nations estimated in November 2014 that some 15,000 foreign fighters from at least 80 nations have traveled to Syria to join the radical jihadists. Roughly a quarter of them come from Western Europe.

Yet the advance of political Islam manifests itself not only in acts of violence. Even as billions are spent on military intervention and drone strikes, the ideological infrastructure of political Islam in the United States continues to grow because officials are concerned only with criminal conspiracies to commit acts of violence, not with the ideology that inspires such acts.

According to one estimate, 10−15 percent of the world’s Muslims are Islamists. Out of well more than 1.6 billion, or 23 percent of the globe’s population, that implies more than 160 million individuals. Based on survey data on attitudes toward sharia in Muslim countries, total support for Islamist activities in the world is likely significantly higher than that estimate.

What Scholarship on Political Islam Says

There are two sets of academic literature aimed at helping policy makers grapple with the threat of radical Islam. In the first set, Islamic religious ideas form a marginal factor at best. Authors such as John Esposito, Marc Sageman, Hatem Bazian, and Karen Armstrong argue that a combination of variables such as poverty and corrupt political governance lies at the root of Islamic violence. They urge the U.S. government and its allies to tackle these “root causes.”

The ideology underlying Islamist violence must be tackled if our efforts are to be successful.

For these authors, devoting attention to religious motives is at best irrelevant, and at worst a harmful distraction. They are not concerned about political Islam as an ideology, only about individual acts of violence committed in its name.

A second set of scholars—which is growing in importance—sees a radical ideology derived from Islamic theology, principles, and concepts as the driving force of our current predicament. Scholars such as Michael Cook, Daniel Pipes, Jeffrey Bale, and David Cook, and authors such as Paul Berman and Graeme Wood, acknowledge that factors such as poverty and bad governance are relevant, but argue that U.S. policy makers should take seriously the religious ideology that underlies Islamist violence.

The failed polices since 9/11 (and even before) in the struggle against radical Islam were built on false premises derived from the first set of literature, which absolves Islam wholly of the atrocities that it inspires. As the failure of American strategy since 2001 has become increasingly clear, however, the view has gained ground that the ideology underlying Islamist violence must be tackled if our efforts are to be successful.

This view is not only held by a few Western scholars. All over the world, there are now Muslims who are engaged in a long-overdue process of reassessing Islamic thought, scripture, and laws with a view to reforming them. These Muslim reformers can be found in positions of leadership in some governments, in universities, in the press, and elsewhere. They are our natural allies. An important part of our future policies in the war on Islamic extremism should be to encourage and empower them.

It’s Time to Understand Dawa

From 9/11 until now, the dominant Western response to political Islam has been to focus only on “terror” and “violent extremism.” This approach has failed. In focusing only on acts of violence, we have ignored the ideology that justifies, promotes, celebrates, and encourages those acts. By not fighting a war of ideas against political Islam (or “Islamism”) as an ideology and against those who spread that ideology, we have made a grave error.

In focusing only on acts of violence, we have ignored the ideology that justifies, promotes, celebrates, and encourages those acts.

If Islamism is the ideology, then dawa encompasses all the methods by which it is spread. The term “dawa” refers to activities carried out by Islamists to win adherents and enlist them in a campaign to impose sharia law on all societies. Dawa is not the Islamic equivalent of religious proselytizing, although it is often disguised as such by blending humanitarian activities with subversive political activities.

Dawa as practiced by Islamists employs a wide range of mechanisms to advance the goal of imposing Islamic law (sharia) on society. This includes proselytization, but extends beyond that. In Western countries, dawa aims both to convert non-Muslims to political Islam and to bring about more extreme views among existing Muslims. The ultimate goal of dawa is to destroy the political institutions of a free society and replace them with strict sharia. Islamists rely on both violent and nonviolent means to achieve their objectives.

Dawa is to the Islamists of today what the “long march through the institutions” was to twentieth-century Marxists. It is subversion from within, the use of religious freedom in order to undermine that very freedom. After Islamists gain power, dawa is to them what Gleichschaltung (synchronization) of all aspects of German state, civil, and social institutions was to the National Socialists.

There are of course differences. The biggest difference is that dawa is rooted in the Islamic practice of attempting to convert non-Muslims to accept the message of Islam. As it is an ostensibly religious missionary activity, proponents of dawa enjoy a much greater protection by the law in free societies than Marxists or fascists did in the past.

Worse, Islamist groups have enjoyed not just protection but at times official sponsorship from government agencies duped into regarding them as representatives of “moderate Muslims” simply because they do not engage in violence. Islamist groups that have been treated in this way include:

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)

The Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC)

The Islamic Society of North America (ISNA)

The International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT)

The Islamic Society of Boston

For organizations engaging in dawa, the main elements of the strategy are:

to have well-organized Islamist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood claim to speak on behalf of all Muslims, while marginalizing Muslim reformers and dissidents.

to take ownership of immigration trends to encourage the “Islamization” of Western societies by invoking hijra, the emigration of the Prophet Muhammad from Mecca to Medina.

to reduce women to the status of reproductive machines for the purpose of demographic transformation.

to take advantage of the focus on “inclusion” by progressive political parties in democratic societies, then to force these parties to accept Islamist demands in the name of peaceful coexistence.

to take advantage of self-consciously progressive movements, effectively co-opting them.

to increase Islamists’ hold over the educational system, including some charter schools, “faith” schools, and home schooling.

Typically, Islamists study target societies to identify points of vulnerability. In the United States, Islamists focus on vulnerable African-American men within prison populations, as well as Hispanic and Native American communities. Recent targets of Islamist infiltration include the Women’s March and Black Lives Matter.

Agents of dawa also systematically lobby private-sector organizations, governments, and international bodies:

They seek to pressure governments to accede to Islamist demands on the grounds of freedom of religion or status as a religious minority.

They urge the United Nations and the European Council to combat “Islamophobia” by devising what amounts to censorship guidelines for politicians and journalists and by punishing those who dissent.

They press institutions such as the Associated Press to distort the language they use to suit Islamist objectives.

They wage sustained campaigns to discredit critics of radical Islam.

The Sinews of Dawa

The global infrastructure of dawa is well funded, persistent, and resilient. From 1973 through 2002, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia spent an estimated $87 billion to promote dawa efforts abroad. Josh Martin estimates that, since the early 1970s, Middle Eastern charities have distributed $110 billion, $40 billion of which found its way to sub-Saharan Africa and contributed heavily to Islamist ideological indoctrination there.

Nongovernmental organizations in Kuwait, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia continue to distribute large sums overseas to finance ideological indoctrination and activities. Powerful foundations such as the Qatar Foundation continue to grant financial support and legitimacy to radical Islamic ideology around the world.

Many Islamic charitable foundations use zakat (mandatory charity) funds to mix humanitarian outreach with ideological indoctrination, laying the ground for future intolerance, misogyny, and jihad, even if no violence is used in the short term. When informal funding mechanisms are included, the zakat funds available could reach “hundreds of billions of dollars” worldwide each year.

The Key Problem Is Using Our Freedoms to End Them

Let it be said explicitly: The Islamists’ program is fundamentally incompatible with the U.S. Constitution, religious tolerance, the equality of men and women, the tolerance of different sexual orientations, and other fundamental human rights.

The biggest challenge the United States faces in combating political Islam, however, is the extent to which agents of dawa can exploit the constitutional and legal protections that guarantee American citizens freedom of religion and freedom of speech—freedoms that would of course be swept away if the Islamists achieved their goals.

We ignore at our peril the ideological infrastructure that supports political Islam in both its violent and its nonviolent forms.

In 2010, one senior American intelligence analyst summed up our predicament: “In the US there are First Amendment issues we’re cognizant of. It’s not a crime to radicalize, only when it turns to violence . . . America is thus vulnerable to a threat that is not only diversifying, but arguably intensifying.”

To give just one example: A cleric in Maryland, Imam Suleiman Bengharsa, has openly endorsed the Islamic State, posted gruesome videos, and praised terrorist attacks overseas. As of February 2017, however, he remains a free man and U.S. authorities insist nothing can be done against him because he has not yet plotted to commit a specific act of violence. One expert has said that Imam Bengharsa “can take his supporters right up to the line. It’s like making a cake and not putting in the final ingredient. It’s winks and nods all the way.” This is what we are up against.

The global constitution of political Islam is formidable. The Muslim Brotherhood, with its numerous American affiliates, is an important component, but not the only one. Even if one were able to eliminate the Brotherhood overnight, the ideological infrastructure of dawa would remain powerful. The network of radical Islamist preachers, “charities,” and organizations that perpetuate political Islam is already well established inside and outside the United States.

To resist the insidious advance of political Islam, we need to develop a strategy to counter not only those who use violence to advance their politico-religious objectives—the jihadists—but also the great and complex ideological infrastructure known as dawa, just as we countered both the Red Army and the ideology of communism in the Cold War. Focusing only on “terror” as a tactic is insufficient. We ignore at our peril the ideological infrastructure that supports political Islam in both its violent and its nonviolent forms.

It is not just that jihad is an extension of dawa; according to some observers, it is dawa by other means. Put differently, nonviolent and violent Islamists differ only on tactics; they share the same goal, which is to establish an unfree society ruled by strict sharia law. Institutionally, nonviolent Islamists have benefited from terror attacks committed by jihadists because such attacks make nonviolent Islamists appear moderate in the eyes of Western governments, even when their goals and values are not. This is known as the “positive radical flank effect. Ian Johnson, a writer for the Wall Street Journal, observed:

Al Qaeda was the best thing to happen to these [Islamist] groups. Nowadays, our bar is so low that if groups aren’t Al Qaeda, we’re happy. If they’re not overtly supporting terrorism, we think they’re okay. We don’t stop to think where the terrorism comes from, where the fish swim.

Dawa must therefore be countered as much as jihad.

Yet, as things stand, dawa cannot be countered. Its agents hide behind constitutional protections they would dismantle unhesitatingly were they in power. In 2017, Congress must therefore give the president the tools he needs to dismantle the infrastructure of dawa in the United States and to counter the spread of political Islam at home and abroad.

Its agents hide behind constitutional protections they would dismantle unhesitatingly were they in power.

While recognizing that our freedoms are sacrosanct, we must also remember the wise words of Karl Popper, who memorably identified what he called “the paradox of tolerance,” namely that “unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance.”

If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be unwise.

But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols.

We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.

Why Trump’s Surgical Strikes In Syria Are The Right Strategy,"On Tuesday, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime launched a chemical weapon attack against his own people—many of whom were sleeping. More than 70 men, women, and children were killed by the nerve agent Sarin, which typically causes agonizing asphyxiation and death.

According to CNN, Assad denied he had used the nerve agent on his own people, insisting, instead, that a routine bombing mission hit a rebel-operated nerve gas “factory.” Assad employed a similar excuse after a 2013 Sarin gas attack, arguing anyone could make Sarin, which he called the “kitchen gas.”

Chemical weapons experts find this explanation highly improbable. Sarin, especially the binary agent type used in the attack, is extremely difficult to manufacture outside of a controlled lab environment.

While the world universally condemned Assad for this attack, it was clear that Russia would not quickly or easily allow a United Nations action aimed at curbing Assad’s power. Because Assad’s attack employed a weapon of mass destruction that even the Nazis refused to use, Tuesday’s actions represented something much more sinister than even the indiscriminate slaughter of small children.

Because Assad continues to possess WMDs, and has now used them twice, a U.S. response was warranted. President Trump acted decisively on Thursday night, sending 59 cruise missiles to destroy a large military installation and airfield Assad had used to launch his nerve gas attack. While some cheered this act, others—especially on the far Right—decried it as unnecessary, illegal, and further evidence that the U.S. meddles where it should not. I disagree, and think Trump got it exactly right with his response.

Assad’s Attack Is a Threat to U.S Interests

Assad, like other madmen and dictators around the world, has been murdering his citizens for years. Approximately 500,000 civilians have been killed in Syria’s multi-year civil war, and we have largely left Syria and its people to figure out the conflict on their own. I do not applaud the doctrine suggesting the United States should be the world’s policeman, nor do I believe it is the United States’ place to punish the perpetrator of every atrocity. The world is a big place, and U.S. resources cannot create universal peace and harmony.

But, much more than a heinous war crime, Assad’s actions represent a dangerous precedent that is directly threatening to U.S. interests at home and abroad. His use of WMDs in time of conflict represents a rare use of a weapon that more than 175 nations have banned, and has only been used in war four other times since World War I (once by Assad in 2013).

If Assad were allowed to act with impunity—which is essentially what happened following his 2013 use of Sarin—every dictator the world over would rightly understand that the United States turns a blind eye to the development and use of WMDs of all kinds, even in the back yards of U.S. allies. How can the United States assert the moral right to call for the denuclearization of North Korea when we care little about the use of a different WMD in Syria? What do we do when a WMD isn’t merely used in our allies’ back yard, but in our own?

Trump Is Telling Syria Not to Mess With Protective Norms

That’s why Trump’s actions were so important. Far from committing us as a participant in Syria’s civil war, or putting us on a collision course with Russia, Thursday’s precision strike sent a robust message.

It was the strongest indication in years that the United States does care about the development, possession, and use of WMDs. It demonstrated that the United States has the ability to assert its power to protect allies and force change at any time, in any location around the world.

It showed that when the United States makes a demand, unfriendly regimes should take note and comply. It re-drew the red line that use of a WMD so strongly represents. Finally, it reinforced in the mind of Assad and every other rogue dictator the world over that those 59 cruise missiles could just as easily have been sent to visit the presidential palace in Damascus, or in some other capital city.

The United States is not the world’s policeman. But the United States is the leader of the free world. In that role, the United States demands certain minimum standards of international comportment. The use of WMDs has been universally decried, and represents a direct threat to our interests in the Middle East and worldwide. Trump was right to assert those interests, and burnish our reputation as the shining city on the hill we’ve been for so long.

What National Interest Does Bombing Syria Serve?,"The United States bombs a country’s airfield, and the president whom Washington’s foreign policy community once universally considered to be a lemon is now credited with being a resolute commander-in-chief who faced down an atrocity with flying colors. A headline in the Huffington Post couldn’t have summarized this dynamic better: “Cable News Praises Trump on Syria, Because Bombing Stuff is ‘Presidential.’”

Blowing up a couple dozen planes from a war criminal’s arsenal makes us all feel good for a few days, especially if it’s in retaliation for a horrible war crime against innocent men, women, and children. Outside of a shot across the dictator’s bow, however, serious observers of world affairs are having a very difficult time explaining what strategic effects the missile attack on a Syrian military airport had.

There certainly hasn’t been any tactical effect—a fleet of combat jets that dropped the sarin gas on a small town in northwestern Syria was up and running a few hours after the strike happened. That the Assad regime felt comfortable bombing the same town and taking off from the same airfield is all the evidence one needs to successfully argue the deterrent impact of last weeks’ operation was minimal.

Assad may think twice about using chemical weapons again — although human rights activists have already reported that Syrian pilots are resuming air operations with chlorine munitions — but Damascus doesn’t need to use those weapons to prosecute the war.

Is President Trump prepared to launch additional military strikes on Syria if barrel bombs continue to rain on opposition neighborhoods, killing 50 to 100 civilians at a clip? And if not, how exactly did the Tomahawk missile attack do anything to help decrease the violence, let alone end the war?

Despots Aren’t Afraid of Missiles Aimed at Weak Dictators

The Trump administration clearly believes the strike on the Sharyat airfield will send Bashar al-Assad a clear warning: Use chemical weapons again at your own risk. But Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is taking that belief one step further, claiming that the attack last week will have a wide-ranging impact on the world’s other despots.

“The message that any nation can take,” Tillerson told ABC News, “is [i]f you violate international norms, if you violate international agreements, if you fail to live up to commitments, if you become a threat to others, at some point a response is likely to be undertaken.” It’s much the same logic the Bush administration used after the invasion of Iraq, when neoconservatives in Washington said Saddam’s downfall would force countries like Iran and North Korea to either ship up or shape out.

This is a comfortable argument to buy into because it suggests the United States is an all-powerful force that can coerce other nations to act in accordance with American values. Yet there are several issues with that belief, a big one being that different leaderships react in different ways to the same events, as no government has identical national interests.

If Tillerson, for instance, thinks sending several dozen Tomahawk missiles into a Syrian airfield will convince Kim Jong-un to magically see the light and eliminate Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons programs out of fear or desperation, he severely overestimates Washington’s ability to frighten other nations from doing what they perceive to be in their best interest.

Therein lies one of the major problems with President Trump’s decision to use military force against the Syrian government: It reinforces to other nations like Iran, Russia, China, and North Korea that their working assumptions about the United States are correct. Instead of changing how they do business, these governments are reassured that the policies that they’re pursuing should not only continue, but be better resourced.

Aggression Can Also Escalate Aggression

North Korea and China are perfect case studies on how military action in Syria may reverberate in other areas of the world.

”The reality of today,” a North Korean government official told the state news media, “shows that we must stand against power with power and it proves a million times over that our decision to strengthen our nuclear deterrence has been the right choice…Only military power of our own will protect us from imperialistic aggression.”

Pyongyang is clearly using the attack in Syria last week to reaffirm a belief its leadership has had about the United States for seven decades: that they are still in the regime change business, are scheming behind the scenes, and have no compunction or hesitation with dropping a several dozen bombs on a sovereign nation’s air base. To Pyongyang, the events of last week are a godsend — a justification in real time of the reasons North Korea must not contemplate any arrangement that results in eliminating their nukes.

Chinese analysts have a somewhat different perspective. Shen Dengli, a professor at Fudan University, summed it up this way: “If the United States gets trapped in Syria, how can Trump make America great again? As a result, China will be able to achieve its peaceful rise…Even though we say we oppose the bombing, deep in our hearts we are happy.”

The view from Beijing, rather than fear at what the Syria attack portends for the future of North Korea, is one of encouragement and endless possibilities — let the United States get bogged down in another Middle Eastern sandpit, because Beijing will then be able to assert itself in the Asia-Pacific with minimal U.S. pushback.

Trump’s decision to use force in Syria last week is instructive: The rule of unintended consequences is alive and well in international politics. Decisions powered by emotion to accomplish a short-term objective can have long-term ramifications.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/04/18/national-interest-bombing-syria-serve/,2017-04-18
How The Champs-Élysées Attack Affects The French Presidential Election,"Last night in Paris, at least one gunman got out of a car at the Champs-Élysées and opened fire on police with an AK-47 assault rifle, killing one officer and injuring two others. The gunman was shot dead at the scene and police have issued a warrant for a second man who reportedly arrived in Paris from Belgium. ISIS claimed responsibility in record time—two and a half hours.

These kinds of small-scale terror attacks are, sadly, becoming commonplace in Europe, and to some extent also here in the United States. But what makes this one extraordinary is that it occurred just three days before France’s highly competitive presidential election—and just two days after a terror plot was broken up in Marseilles, with police seizing guns and bomb-making materials, and arresting two radicalized French nationals.

The top four presidential candidates are all within a stone’s throw of one another, and it’s anyone’s guess which two will make it to the second round of voting. But one thing is fairly certain: the Thursday night terrorist attack will benefit only one candidate—Marine Le Pen.

Nobody Wants This to Be the New Normal

The shooting took place while the 11 presidential candidates were on a French television special, giving them the opportunity to make statements on the spot. Independent centrist Emmanuel Macron, who leads Le Pen and her National Front party in the most recent polls by a razor-thin margin, sent his condolences and said the job of a president is to protect the country. But he also said, somewhat incredibly, that these kinds of attacks will be a regular occurrence in the coming years.

Macron might be right about that, and it’s probably the most realistic response, but it won’t play well with French voters. What voter wants to hear his potential president essentially respond to a terrorist attack with “Get used to it”?

Le Pen, on the other hand, said the “nightmare is beginning once again” but that she doesn’t “want to tell our children to get used to living with terrorism.” According to Le Pen, “permissiveness and naiveté are finished.”

Compared to Macron’s defeatist-realist statement, Le Pen could come out looking like the strong national leader France needs, even if voters find many of her views disagreeable. After all, fear for one’s safety or the safety of one’s country can have a strong influence on voters.

In addition, the attack fits nicely into Le Pen’s campaign narrative. She has been openly critical about Muslims in France, and claims to promote “true” French values and patrimony. She rails against the lack of assimilation in the Muslim community (not without reason), and much of her campaign platform is focused on immigration and national security.

Is Doubling Down on French Identity Helpful?

This attack might therefore give her the extra bump she’s been hoping for to ensure her a spot in round two of voting. Yet there is little to suggest that Le Pen’s policies would ameliorate the country’s Islamist problem. And have no doubt, France does have a problem on its hands.

But Le Pen’s approach will almost definitely alienate the French-Muslim community further. She will widen the divide by promoting the culture of the “Français de souche,” a contentious term for French citizens whose family lines goes back generations, and denigrating the nouveau français, or immigrants.

Of course, Le Pen’s plan to shut down immigration will not improve French security, given that the overwhelming majority of terrorist attacks in Europe (and the United States) are perpetrated by the children of immigrants, not immigrants themselves.

Why Islamists Might Want Le Pen In Power

There’s good reason to believe ISIS was involved in planning, not just inspiring, Thursday’s attack, considering the swiftness with which it claimed responsibility, and the fact that the terror group knew the attacker’s name. But given Le Pen’s strong rhetoric against ISIS and Islam in France, why would the Islamic State plan two attacks in one week, knowing full well that it would benefit Le Pen alone among the candidates?

One possibility, as elaborate as it may sound, is that if Islamists want to keep French Muslims from integrating into French society and encourage them to resist through violence, it would be in their best interest to have Le Pen in power. A Le Pen presidency would give the Islamic State the narrative they need to radicalize a very susceptible French Muslim community.

As we know, ISIS is incredibly media-savvy. It strains credulity that two attacks were planned for the week before the election with just enough time for the media to really dig into them but not enough time for them to fade from voters’ memories. The timing doesn’t seem like coincidence.

It’s hard not to think that the men arrested in Marseilles, or whoever helped them plan, knew full well the result a terror attack could produce in Sunday’s elections. When police prevented the well-planned plot, the terror cell, with or without direction from ISIS, went to Plan B—a man with a machine gun on the Champs-Élysées.

Regardless of how Thursday’s attack came to pass, it will almost certainly help Le Pen in Sunday’s election. But it will hurt future prospects of quelling the tensions between France and its Muslim community, or of stifling Islamist influence in those communities—something that was never going to be easy in the first place.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/04/21/champs-elysees-attack-affects-french-presidential-election/,2017-04-21
"Attack Sebastian Gorka’s Ideas, Not His Credentials Or Person","Andrew Reynolds may be a good professor of global studies, but he’s pretty bad at basic research, at least where Sebastian Gorka is concerned. Reynolds recently made a startling accusation that Trump advisor Gorka’s PhD dissertation was short on research and approved by an unqualified committee at an unserious academic institution. He called Gorka a “fraud—a charlatan of the most brazen hue.”

This story has gained traction, as Gorka (second only to Stephen Bannon) elicits especially intense reactions from opponents. Gorka has been subjected to intense media and public scrutiny, including being run off the stage at Georgetown by students who also questioned his credentials and accused him of anti-Semitism, and tarred by comedian Samantha Bee. The ensuing feeding frenzy apparently nearly cost Gorka his White House post.

I write not so much in defense of Gorka, whose policy views are not my own, but in defense of the truth. What Reynolds and many others have been saying about Gorka runs from the merely unwarranted to the demonstrably false.

Who Is Sebastian Gorka, Anyway?

If the name is unfamiliar, Gorka is a deputy assistant to President Trump, and because of that would be a figure of controversy no matter how mild-mannered in person. Gorka is not mild-mannered. In place of the usual academic hesitancy, laden with qualifications, he offers arresting candor.

Moreover, he has come in for special hatred from Reynolds, it seems, because Gorka displays hallmarks of academic respectability—dapper dress, English accent, PhD credentials—while espousing views many academics find embarrassing, wrongheaded, and even scandalous.

Hatred, however, is no justification for libel. A little online digging was all it took to show Reynolds’s assertions to be unsubstantiated. The search began at Corvinus University of Budapest’s library, Gorka’s alma mater, where online versions of both his dissertation and a shorter summary are available. Reynolds directs much of his criticism at the qualification of external reviewers listed in the summary, and he assumes they were the only reviewers.

But why assume that? Labeling them “external” already implies they’re not the only reviewers and, indeed, a current university policy document requires a committee with internal members, external members, and a public defense. Reynolds would need to know the exact composition of the committee to reach his conclusion, and he offers no evidence of such knowledge. It seems to me before you try to destroy a man’s career, this is the sort of detail you make sure you get right.

Let’s Look at That Dissertation

Gorka’s dissertation document is 240 pages total, with 264 footnotes in 195 pages of the main text, all fairly standard. His superviser, Lánczi András, is a professor at Corvinus University, head (rektora in Hungarian) of the Political Science Institute, and a former Fulbright research grant recipient in the United States. Those are standard, even impressive, credentials and certainly pass the initial smell test.

There was also a second adviser, professor Stephen Sloan, who is a distinguished fellow for the Global Perspective Office at the University of Central Florida (UCF) where he was previously Lawrence J. Chastang Distinguished Professor of Terrorism Studies. Sloan’s PhD is in comparative politics from New York University (NYU), a university of considerable prestige.

Gorka’s dissertation identifies Sloan’s affiliation as Temple University, also a top research university. Around the time Gorka completed his dissertation, a press release from Syracuse University identified Sloan as “a terrorism expert from the University of Central Florida and Temple University,” so nothing appears to be amiss there, either.

Either Reynolds has blundered rather embarrassingly, or (much more likely) this is a mendacious ideological attack—and a sloppy one at that. Academics justly bristle at phony claims to the hard-won respectability attendant upon a PhD. The path to a terminal degree is arduous, the demands extreme, the costs—both personal and financial—great. But in using concerns about academic rigor and credibility as a cloak of respectability around a nakedly ideological attack, it is Reynolds, not Gorka, who has damaged academia.

He has helped poison an environment where personality is supposed to be subordinate to reasoned debate, where ideas are supposed to matter more than prestige, and where the truth is supposed to be the standard against which all claims are measured. Reynolds has an impressive CV; he is entitled to disagree with Gorka and on debatable matters of policy may even be right. But his baseless attack violated the standards he’s supposedly defending.

He could have, and should have, used his considerable research skills and resources to go a little deeper and discover the facts about Gorka, then gotten on with the business of the actual disagreement: crucial matters of domestic and foreign policy for which we all need and benefit from the valuable insights of academic experts. Reynolds just couldn’t resist the temptations of righteous indignation instead. The ideologue never can.

Danger Flares After Erdogan Bodyguards Beat U.S. Citizens,"Since the nation’s founding, America has been isolationist and interventionist, pacifist and aggressive, a mortal enemy of Great Britain and the closest of allies. Yet one thing has remained consistent: Americans don’t tolerate foreign nations wantonly violating the rights of our citizens.

A dramatic video surfaced of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s bodyguards violently assaulting protestors outside Turkey’s embassy in Washington DC. Another, more recent video appeared to show Erdogan speaking to his bodyguards just before the attack took place and watching as the scene unfolded. This kind of incident has become all too common in Turkey, but was a shocking sight in the United States.

In its official response, the Turkish embassy denied wrongdoing, called the bodyguards’ obviously aggressive actions (which included kicking a woman curled up on the ground) “self-defense,” and insinuated that the protestors were aligned with terrorists. The D.C. Metropolitan Police harshly condemned the attack, saying in a statement: “The actions seen outside the Turkish embassy yesterday in Washington, D.C. stand in contrast to the First Amendment rights and principles we work tirelessly to protect each and every day.”

This isn’t the first incident between the Turkish Presidential Protection Department and Americans in Washington. Just last year, they accosted journalists outside the Brookings Institution and have had numerous run-ins with the U.S. Secret Service. While these improprieties have mostly met little practical response, the latest incident was far more egregious and public. The Turkish response so far has been dismissive and unapologetic although Americans are appalled by the video.

To remind the democratically challenged Turks, the American electorate’s mood, and therefore its leaders, can become hostile when U.S. citizens are routinely attacked or threatened.

‘A Good Thrashing’

In one of the earliest examples of American intervention overseas, President Thomas Jefferson deployed the infant U.S. Navy to attack Barbary pirates on the North African coast. While most nations simply bribed the pirates to stop harassing their ships, Americans found the continual capture and imprisonment of our citizens on the high seas to be intolerable. Jefferson’s intervention led to a short, violent conflict in which several Barbary leaders were toppled and their gangster regimes reduced to vassal states of more powerful neighbors.

It wasn’t only small powers that the United States was willing to tangle with when American rights and sovereignty were violated. The United States went to war with Britain, then a towering global power, after repeated British impressment of American sailors and an infamous incident in which the British Navy attacked an American warship because it refused inspection just off the coast of Virginia.

What followed was a brutal three-year struggle in which the far weaker United States battled with the British Empire at great cost. The United States proved to be more trouble than the fight was worth, so the two sides worked out a status quo treaty.

In another case, President Andrew Jackson, to whom President Donald Trump has drawn a connection, took immediate military action in response to a Malaysian nabbing of an American cargo ship. He deployed U.S. warships to the area, and his navy secretary simply told the dispatch to give the Malaysians “a good thrashing.”

The American warships sailed into the offending Malaysian port and laid waste to it. Its disproportionate use of force was shocking to many, but the American people generally accepted it as comeuppance for the outrages against U.S. sovereignty. These are just some of the numerous incidents in American history in which even seemingly small infractions of citizens’ rights have led to foreign conflict.

An Alliance in Decline?

No actions have been taken against participants in the Turkish attack, and so far the State Department has cautiously danced around the issue. Several Republican senators have condemned the incident and asked for an apology from Turkey, but it remains to be seen what the Trump administration will do in response.

The spontaneous brawl was a reckless move for a regime that depends so much on its partnership with the United States, and a show of disrespect not only to American law, but to America’s most deeply cherished beliefs and customs. While the United States has built a long-term relationship with Turkey—first to counter the Soviet threat in the Cold War, and now to counter the Islamist terrorist threat in the Middle East—there is now less certainty that the two countries truly have aligned interests.

Despite Turkey’s inclusion in NATO as an important member, the U.S.-Turkey alliance is under strain. While U.S. presidents have bitten their tongues on Turkish human rights abuses and, of course, the Armenian genocide (which the Turkish government still denies), the two nations have become increasingly at odds in regard to Syria. It’s also unclear how committed Turkey is to destroying the Islamic State—a top U.S. foreign policy goal.

While this story may soon get buried by the news cycle, it could signal a long-term fracture in this important relationship. American history is full of “bend but don’t break” incidents in which foreign regimes have treated Americans badly. But when the American people see violations of American rights go unpunished, in the past it has rapidly changed the electorate’s mood and led to violent conflicts.

While Turkey and the United States are unlikely to go to war, public reaction to the flagrant abuse of American citizens by Erdogan’s delegation could exacerbate the long-term decline of the two countries’ relations. If the Turkish government continues to let these incidents fester without apology or control, the American people will push their leaders to rupture the long-standing alliance.

Erdogan and the Turkish embassy would be wise to remember that when the patience of the American people snaps, it breaks savagely and unpredictably.

Manchester Bombing Foreshadows Another Fraught Ramadan,"The suicide bomber in Monday night’s terrorist attack in Manchester, England has been identified as 22-year-old Salman Abedi. He was the son of Libyan refugees who fled Muammar Gaddafi’s regime, but Abedi grew up in Manchester. According to police, he was “known to authorities,” but it’s not entirely clear in what capacity, and worshiped at a mosque suspected of funding jihadists. Abedi’s brother has been arrested, according to British police, and there have been raids throughout the city in connection with the bombing.

Although this isn’t only a foreign policy matter (the West has a real problem with the radicalized children of immigrants from Muslim-majority countries) the attack and bomber’s profile, as far as we currently know, are stark reminders of the continued threat of ISIS and why the United States needs to adopt policies that encourage stability in the Middle East.

Ramadan: a Month of Prayer for Many Different Reasons

The horrific bombing, which left 22 dead and more than 50 wounded, comes just four days before the beginning of the Muslim holiday of Ramadan that goes until June 24. Ramadan is the month when the Quran was supposedly revealed to the prophet Mohammed. It is a time of fasting, prayer, and contemplation for Muslims around the world. But it has also been a time of heightened terror attacks. Last year, experts predicted that Ramadan would bring an increase in terror attacks from ISIS, and it did.

During the month of Ramadan in 2016, ISIS claimed responsibility for: the stabbing of a police office and his partner in France; the Ataturk Airport bombing; the Orlando nightclub shooting; and an attack in Dhaka, Bangladesh that killed 24. In the weeks that followed Ramadan, the Nice attack occurred, killing 86 and injuring hundreds; a French priest’s throat was slit in his church; and in Germany there was an attack on a train in Würzburg and a bombing near a music festival in Ansbach.

It’s possible that the bombing on Monday night will be the first in a series of attacks in the West during Ramadan and the summer months. The bombing also happened to have coincided with the fourth anniversary of the killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby, who was brutally hacked to death in southeast London by two men carrying knives, who then tried to behead him.

The Ripple Effects of ISIS Losses in Syria and Iraq

Whatever the reason for the timing, the Manchester bombing is a stunning reminder that despite ISIS losing territory in the Middle East, its appeal isn’t totally lost on young Muslims living in the West. While we don’t yet know whether Abedi traveled overseas to train with ISIS—although it appears he travelled several times to Libya, where his parents are believed to have returned after Gaddafi’s ouster in 2011—the attack also reminds us of the concerns experts have had for some time about the ripple effects of ISIS’s gradual loss of territory in Syria and Iraq.

As I have previously written, analysts have worried that as the Islamic State loses its foothold in the Middle East, foreign fighters will begin flowing back home, armed with extensive military training and a radical Islamist ideology. The U.S. coalition partners fighting ISIS in places like Mosul are trying hard to ensure that they don’t let any fighters, foreign or otherwise, slip through with the thousands of refugees fleeing ISIS-controlled areas and melt back into the general population, but there’s no way for anyone to catch them all.

It’s not surprising, therefore, that of the 850 or so British citizens who went to fight with ISIS, about 400 have returned to England. But there’s also concern that as ISIS loses its territories in Syria and Iraq and returns to its al-Qaeda roots, it will ramp up its campaign to radicalize in the West, and homegrown terror attacks will increase. In addition to returning ISIS fighters, British security services are monitoring another 3,000 potential terrorists. But as Abedi’s case so terribly demonstrates, the police can’t keep track of them all, nor can they predict which ones will turn out to be high-risk.

The Never-Ending War

It’s unknown if Abedi received direct guidance from ISIS or was instead inspired by them. However, authorities don’t think Abedi had the know-how to make the bomb he detonated, raising concerns that he may be part of a larger cell and a bomb-maker could be assisting other would-be attackers.

That is, in part, why Secretary of Defense James Mattis said Friday that the total annihilation of ISIS is necessary to prevent the threat from hopping from location to location without disappearing. Even if the Manchester attacker wasn’t a foreign fighter, the continued existence of ISIS risks the radicalization and activation of aspiring jihadists in the West. The risks, and the cost, are too high. “Total annihilation” isn’t mere hyperbole in this case; it’s a strategic imperative.

But any U.S. strategy for defeating ISIS—or al-Qaeda—must rest on the knowledge that total annihilation is unlikely for one important reason. These terrorist groups thrive in unstable countries and failed states, which the Middle East and North Africa have in spades. They will always move into and expand in regions where this instability flourishes. We’ve seen this in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Somalia, and Afghanistan.

So, while President Trump’s speech over the weekend urging the leaders of Muslim countries to take the initiative in fighting terrorism was the right message, it was also perhaps naïve not to see that the United States will have to promote regional stability in all the ways it can, including a more robust military presence in the Middle East, in order to give ISIS and al-Qaeda no quarter.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/05/24/manchester-bombing-foreshadows-another-fraught-ramandan/,2017-05-24
"Politicians May Be Afraid To Name Islamic Terror, But Morrissey Isn’t","In the wake of the horrific terror attack at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, United Kingdom, an unlikely famous Mancunian offered perhaps the most sober analysis of the situation. It was Morrissey, the mopey symbol of a wallflower generation, who let loose on Facebook to confront his country’s abysmal record on and response to radical Islamic terror. Here’s what the former Smiths front man had to say:

Celebrating my birthday in Manchester as news of the Manchester Arena bomb broke. The anger is monumental.

For what reason will this ever stop? Theresa May says such attacks ‘will not break us’, but her own life is lived in a bullet-proof bubble, and she evidently does not need to identify any young people today in Manchester morgues. Also, ‘will not break us’ means that the tragedy will not break her, or her policies on immigration. The young people of Manchester are already broken – thanks all the same, Theresa. Sadiq Khan says ‘London is united with Manchester’, but he does not condemn Islamic State – who have claimed responsibility for the bomb. The Queen receives absurd praise for her ‘strong words’ against the attack, yet she does not cancel today’s garden party at Buckingham Palace – for which no criticism is allowed in the Britain of free press. Manchester mayor Andy Burnham says the attack is the work of an ‘extremist’. An extreme what? An extreme rabbit?

In modern Britain everyone seems petrified to officially say what we all say in private. Politicians tell us they are unafraid, but they are never the victims. How easy to be unafraid when one is protected from the line of fire. The people have no such protections. Morrissey

23 May 2017.

There is a lot to unpack here. First and foremost is his frustration at a British government whose policies do not put its own citizens’ safety first. It isn’t clear if Morrissey’s criticism of Prime Minister Theresa May’s immigration policies is rooted in her promise to reduce immigration, or her failure to deliver on that promise. What is clear is his belief that May is not willing to name the victims. She is not willing to fully accept the consequences of a vastly changing United Kingdom, and the dangers that are becoming increasingly apparent.

His criticism of the mayors of London and Manchester is much clearer. They will not name the evil that killed 22 people, including children as young as eight years old. They will not call it radical Islamic terrorism. They call it extremism, but as Morrissey points out, “an extreme what? An extreme rabbit?” It’s a damning line, quick and cutting, as is his style.

Morrissey says we all know who is committing these attacks and why, but politicians are too fearful to say it. Although he does not use the term “political correctness,” the implication is obvious. The lyricist who has never been afraid to speak unpopular truths is calling out the British government for coddling the terrorists who kill kids.

No Excuses for Religion Gone Rabid

Morrissey’s politics have always been hazy. He is a fervent anti-monarchist who wrote the lyrics for an album called “The Queen Is Dead.” He also penned a song about Tory Prime Minister Maggie Thatcher called “Margaret on the Guillotine.” On the other hand, his song “National Front Disco” calls for “England for the English,” and nothing in the song mocks that position.

Predictably, the progressive music zines have been quick to attack Morrissey. Here’s Spin Magazine: “[R]ather than simply extending sympathies to the families of the concert attendees who died and were injured, the singer-songwriter’s comments focused on his own ‘anger’ at the situation, and what he deemed an insufficient response on the part of British leaders, including Prime Minister Theresa May and Queen Elizabeth.” Well, God forbid he criticize the government. We can’t have that.

His statement in the wake of the concert attack is clearer than his song lyrics, and it’s not the first time. In the wake of the Orlando massacre at a gay nightclub, Morrissey had this to say:

Although the gunman who massacred 49 people at an Orlando gay club is said to have been ‘repulsed’ by homosexuality, he nonetheless left behind a slew of self-adoring ‘selfies’; a handsome man gazing enchantedly at his own face. It is therefore acceptable for him to lovingly admire his own maleness, but it is not OK for other men to like other men. Does Islamic scripture say it is fitting for a man to sit alone taking adoring photographs of himself? I doubt it.

The finest lyricist of his generation has just about had it with Islamic terrorism and its apologists. These constant attacks do not “happen to be committed by Muslims,” they are committed by Muslims because a perverse version of that religion has spread far and wide. As he is quick to condemn the sins of the Catholic faith he was born into, he is equally quick to condemn Islam’s faults.

This is a lesson we would all be wise to learn. We don’t need to treat the people of Mohammed with kid gloves any more than we treat the people of Abraham or Christ that way. When in the pursuit of religious goals we repress, oppress, or kill, we are at odds with the nature of our faiths. Morrissey’s demand that Islamic extremism be called Islamic extremism is of a piece with his many criticisms of Catholicism. That criticism of his own people’s faith puts him in an excellent position to criticize the excesses of other faiths.

The Poet’s Truth

Poets put into succinct and meaningful words those things we struggle to express. They play in nuance and moments, allowing us some clarity. Throughout his remarkable career, Morrissey has always done so. “Everyday Is Like Sunday” can be viewed as a song against nuclear proliferation, just as “Reel Around The Fountain” can be heard as a pro-life anthem.

Morrissey’s statement on the Manchester attack is as clear as anything he has ever written. And we should heed it. We are vulnerable. People want to kill us, and while politicians live safe and sound the people live under the threat of terror. This terror has a name, whether we are willing to say it or not.

When I heard of the attack on Manchester, even before reading Morrissey’s statement, my thoughts turned first to his words. In his song, “Suffer Little Children,” from the Smiths’ first album, he writes: “Oh Manchester, so much to answer for / Edward, see those alluring lights? Tonight will be your very last night. / A woman said, I know my son is dead, I’ll never rest my hands on his sacred head.”

The song is about the Moors Murders of the mid-1960s, in which five children were murdered by a disturbed couple. The atrocity happened during Morrissey’s greenest youth in Manchester and left a mark on the man. Now, in his twilight, Morrissey has once again seen innocent children massacred. He will not be shy about placing blame where it belongs—on Islamic terror—and we shouldn’t be shy about it either.

Meet The WWII Soldier I Remember On Memorial Day,"Listening to “Holy, Holy, Holy” made my grandfather cry. One day at church, after playing the old hymn with our worship team, I walked over and sat down next to him. He was about 81 at the time. Tears were streaming down his cheeks.

When he was 18 years old, my grandfather became a soldier. During World War II, he fought in the 86th infantry Blackhawk Division (341st Infantry Division, Company F). After landing in Europe, my grandfather journeyed across France before arriving in Germany. Likely in Helberhausen, from what I can guess, some friends in his company discovered a deserted mansion house. Inside were all sorts of ornate and lovely things.

The friends dressed up in fancy clothes and hats they discovered inside, stuffing pillows under their clothing and taking pompous pictures. They posed with a tiny little boy who wanted his picture taken. They put on a play, and made themselves a meal from what remained in the kitchen, then sat around together and enjoyed the quiet evening. A talented musician among them found an accordion in the house. He sat among his buddies, playing “Holy, Holy, Holy.”

The next day, Grandpa told me, nearly all those men—including the accordion player—died in battle. He would describe the moment of shock when they were attacked. They were proceeding down a quiet road, when suddenly they came under fire. I heard him tell this story many times, each time as if he’d never told it before. Each time as if he was trying to go back and wrest some sanity, logic, or control from the chaos of it.

My grandfather’s experience likely happened during the Ruhr Pocket offensive. This description seems to fit his experience:

After being held in tactical reserve at Helberhausen, the 341st was motorized und moved out at 0600. The 2nd Bn., 341st Infantry were placed in the point of the attack with the Cannon Co., 341st Inf. attached. At 1200 the general attack started with a road block near Brugge being the first objective to fall. At 1600 the force was brought to a halt by small arms and panzerfaust fire, with several vehicles being knocked out with severe casualties. The 2nd Bn. was able to regain the offense after a slight delay and continued to gain until the battalion reached Priorie (“Priorei”). At Priorie, the 341st ran into one the well-established flak emplacements which were scattered throughout the Ruhr; such as at Bonzel and Seigen (“Siegen”). The entire 2nd Bn. was pinned down for a lengthy period and Cannon Co., 341st attempted to come to their assistance. A panzerfaust hit one personnel carrier killing four men and wounding ten others. Pfc. Rudolph A. Kovic, of Pittsburg, was a crewman on a Cannon Co. gun and his crew was subject to intense fire from a nearby house. On his own initiative he secured a bazooka and advanced to within 50 yards of the house and destroyed it, capturing 18 Germans. When Co. F. 341st Inf. was halted by the heavy opposition near Priorie. Pfc. Lynwood B. King, Jr., of Savannah, Ga., received severe flesh wounds. Nevertheless he refused medical assistance and continued to fight with the platoon until the enemy strong point was reduced. By 1800 the enemy forces were in rout at Priorie and the 2nd Bn., 341st continued the attack and at 2400 on April 13, the Black Hawk units were drawing up on the outskirts of the huge industrial city of Hagen, where the 341st set up a perimeter defense. During the day, Generals Eisenhower, Bradley and Hodges visited the 341st Regiment CP at Attendorn. After the ordeal the 2nd Bn., 341st had been through the previous day in advancing to the outskirts of Hagen, it was relieved at 0600 by the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the 341st Inf. and the 2nd Bn. went into regimental reserve.

This skirmish may be a footnote in the history books. But for my grandfather, it changed his life. In the grand scheme of things, the loss of life was “balanced out” by overarching victory. But that 18-year-old lost nearly all his friends in one day.

I’ve read through my grandpa’s scrapbook, and I’ve heard his stories. But sadly, as a kid, I researched my Grandpa’s experiences, or considered how his story fit into the larger themes and battles of World War II. It felt so distant: mumbled quietly in my Grandpa’s thoughtful, murmuring voice, every story took on the fuzzy feeling of a black-and-white film. The losses he experienced seemed too distant, too far off to associate with our own time.

I’m delving into the stories now. But I feel that I’m too late: I should have asked my grandfather more questions while I still could. I should have pulled out whatever resources I could find, and unearthed more facts about the battles that troubled and scarred him. I should’ve discovered the names of old war friends he remembered, and tried to track them down for him.

The burden we feel to the past should be great. Often, sadly, it is not. We listen to the murmured stories without reverence. Death is too far from us, tragedy too distant.

My generation is perhaps the most distanced from war. Our country’s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are distant fact for many, their costs fully understood by few outside the military community. The 9/11 attack is the closest many millennials have gotten to the sort of shock and horror experienced by those young men—many of them just boys—in World War II.

When we think of trigger warnings these days, we often think of students on college campuses. But when I think of trigger warnings, I think of my grandfather listening to “Holy, Holy, Holy”—and of the joy that dissolved into horror in less than 24 hours. Many of us can’t even comprehend living with the pain of such memories.

When my grandfather returned home from World War II, widespread understanding of PTSD was still limited. After marriage and children, his episodes of grief were difficult for his wife and children to understand. He didn’t open up about his war experiences, or start talking about “Holy, Holy, Holy,” until my childhood years—after he’d become a Christian.

Following World War II, my grandpa went on to become a pharmacist. He made exquisitely detailed model ships in his spare time that took him years to finish. He took up watercolor painting, completing hundreds of paintings in his lifetime.

He’d wake up early and fix his grandkids eggs, bacon, and toast, or bake biscotti and chocolate chip cookies for us to enjoy after a long road trip. He helped his wife complete her crossword puzzles (in pen, pre-Google). After I got my first story published in World Magazine as a college student, he sent me a huge bouquet of flowers, with a note that said, “To the best journalist in the world.”

My grandpa made peace with his past, with the tragedy, chaos, and death it wrought. But it took decades and a transformative conversion experience to help bring that peace. Meanwhile, I enjoyed the fruit of his labor and sacrifice: the comfort and solace of safety, the sweetness of freedom and security from danger.

When my grandfather passed away last year, I sang “Holy, Holy, Holy” and “Amazing Grace” with him one last time. Although he couldn’t speak aloud, his jaw moved along to the words of the songs. We’ve been blessed beyond comprehension, to grow up with the peace we’ve had. But may we never forget that we stand on the shoulders of giants.

Today, to the soldiers who’ve fought in countless battles, who bear countless scars—I want to say thank you. Thank you for your sacrifice, for your thankless labors. Thank you for bearing up under the tragedies and the horrors of the past. You are not forgotten.

Politico Attacks Animal Activism Organization Because A Trump Is Involved,"In its increasingly absurd attempts to discredit all things Trump, the mainstream media has latched onto an animal rights organization because it’s connected to someone with the last name Trump. In an article titled “Lara Trump’s controversial pet issue,” Politico’s Darren Samuelsohn looked for anything he could find against the wife of Donald Trump’s son, Eric. That’s right, not even Trump’s daughter-in-law is safe from media hit pieces.

So what did Politico find that’s so “controversial” about the organization Lara Trump helps? Did they kill more animals than they saved, like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has? Are they a front for some insidious money-laundering scheme? Do they secretly abuse the animals they claim to help?

No, of course not. Politico could find nothing the organization does wrong, but one member of the Beagle Freedom Project’s leadership team spent nearly six years in jail for sending online threats to a company that conducts product tests on animals. This man’s name is Kevin Kjonaas, but he goes by Kevin Chase. He’s BFP’s head of operations, and wasn’t named in the article until paragraph six. Lara Trump was named in the headline and first paragraph.

In an interview with Politico, Chase said he never told Trump about his criminal past. Maybe she could be faulted for not looking into the past of every person who works for a particular charity, but who does that, honestly? A source close to Trump said she didn’t know Chase “very well and was not aware of his past.”

It’s another trumped-up story designed to make it look like no one with the last name of Trump is capable of doing anything right. This particular story is shameful and knocks a perfectly legitimate organization—albeit with far leftist leanings—in an unwavering attempt to hurt the First Family.

BFP seeks so end animal testing. One may not agree with that premise (other animal rights groups have said animal testing is heavily regulated already), but the organization does what any organization with an agenda does: Lobby. It lobbies lawmakers to stop testing products on animals. It won an award from Microsoft for a social media campaign, and reported $1.6 million in income in 2015.

That’s the other interesting part about this hit piece: Politico is attacking an organization with a far leftist view in order to hit a Trump. Think about that scorched earth mentality for a moment.

This also brings up a dilemma that many on the Left—and Right—have grappled with. Is someone who does something criminal never allowed a second chance? Do we want Chase cast out of society forever because of his previously awful tactics? Or is it that we just want to never hear from him again? Truly, the only reason anyone is hearing about him now is because the media has an agenda against the Trumps, and will damage anyone who associates with them. Chase did his time, and he should be allowed to live and work free from attacks.

This is not the first time the mainstream media has written an exaggerated hit piece on the Trumps. On Inauguration Day, The New York Times reported that Trump had “purged” all the “climate change references” from the official White House website, when in reality it was just a routine change between administrations. There have also been numerous attacks lodged against Ivanka Trump’s business, even though she appears to be attempting to bring her father more in line with leftist positions.

Lara Trump wants to be the first member of a presidential family who works on behalf of animals. Her work and the people who work with her should not be attacked just because of her last name.

Here’s What We Know About The London Terrorist Attack So Far,"Officials are searching for three suspects who reportedly plowed into a crowd of about 20 people with a white van on London Bridge and then proceeded to stab individuals with 12-inch hunting knives late Saturday night.

Seven were reportedly killed in the attack, but the official death toll has not been tallied as of yet, Daily Mail reports.

“Police said they fired shots after reports of stabbings in the nearby Borough Market area, and that they were also responding to an incident in the Vauxhall area further west, but gave no immediate details,” Reuters reported.

Police are now saying that the Vauxhall incident is not connected to the violent attacks that occurred in Borough Market and on The London Bridge, according to CNN.

Last week, 22 people died at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester in what officials said was the most deadly terror attack in the U.K. since 2005. ISIS later claimed responsibility for the attack.

The bomber’s father and his two brothers were arrested and it has been reported there was a terror ring involved in planning and carrying out the attack. In the immediate aftermath of last week’s attack, London police were on high alert for fear that another attack might happen imminently.

"After London Bridge, World Is Sick Of Politicians Downplaying Terrorism","As if on cue, in the wake of Saturday’s terrorist attack in London political leaders are trotting out the usual treacly lines that have become so rote. But the words they pretend will provide comfort to anyone but the most naïve are borderline worthless. Worse, they’re an insult to the families who have had to experience the shocking pain of the sudden loss of a family member or friend at the hands of a terrorist.

Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, called Saturday’s attack “deliberate and cowardly,” and asked “all Londoners to remain calm and vigilant today and in the days ahead.” Most notably, he said: “You will see an increased police presence today, including armed officers and uniformed officers. There is no reason to be alarmed by this. We are the safest global city in the world.”

What a thing to say at a time like this. Shouldn’t Britons be alarmed? Isn’t Saturday’s attack in London, coming as it did on the heels of the Manchester bombing, deeply disturbing? Why isn’t Khan more concerned about the threats that are so obviously at the doorstep, or better put, in Britain’s streets? Does anyone really take comfort from being told about swift police response times after yet another terrorist attack?

Our Politicians Can’t Handle the Truth

The sad truth, and getting sadder with every attack, is that the political class has little interest in doing what would really be necessary to combat Islamist terrorism, let alone talk about it. They don’t want to talk about how Britain’s lax immigration policies over decades led to hundreds of thousands of immigrants entering the country with varying degrees of willingness to assimilate and adopt Western values. They don’t want to openly criticize the blatant problems with the multiculturalism the UK has pursued for years and the obvious impact it has had on the immigrant population.

Oh no. This would cost them too much. It would shatter the façade of political correctness that’s been constructed over our “civilized” western world, and destroy the illusion, so vital to the political class, that Western values are universal.

The politicians are only willing to give speeches about how united we are and how terrorists cannot tear us apart. But the truth—so clear and obvious—is that with every attack the West becomes more and more divided. We are not united, not by a long shot. Before the bodies of the poor souls who were killed Saturday by radical Islamists were even identified, the Left and Right were at one another’s throats. On that score, the terrorists emerge victorious every time.

Yes, there are beautiful and touching scenes of strangers helping one another, opening their homes, offering free rides. This is a reminder of the goodness that still exists as part of our shared humanity. But such gestures don’t, ultimately, unite us. Neither do candlelight vigils and marches through the streets of Paris—or tearful pop concerts in Manchester.

The Intellectually Weak Attack Anyone More Courageous

There’s little to no tolerance in polite society for the kind of honesty for which many in the West are hungry. The Washington Post ran a headline Sunday that read, “World Leaders Call For Unity After London Attack. Trump tweets the complete opposite.” The article chastises President Trump for not joining in the fake condolences and platitudes of the political elite, and praises those elites for their messages of hope. But what, exactly, are they saying we should be hopeful for?

Trump, who is often wrong, was correct in tweeting Sunday that, “We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people.” A growing number of those people are scared, and sick of turning on the news to hear of yet another heartbreaking attack then hearing the same meaningless bromides from their leaders.

They want a leader who doesn’t just try to inure them to this kind of random violence but stands up and says that we’re not going to take it, that this isn’t an acceptable status quo. Whether Trump is that leader is highly debatable, but at least he’s making a nod toward it.

But whenever political leaders do dare to talk candidly about some of these problems, there’s intense pushback and outrage. Take Trump’s travel ban. Like it or hate it, the ban was aimed at curbing immigration from countries that are de facto failed states. These are places where a terrorist could easily go unnoticed by whatever remnant of a security service remains and fly to the United States undetected. When Trump unveiled his travel ban earlier this year, America practically devoured itself with protests at airports, counter-protests, and a wave of lawsuits. The reaction robbed us of any real chance of having a conversation about the ways in which we might need to reconsider our immigration policies for the sake of national security.

The Real Message: Get Used to It

British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday that “enough is enough” and that Britain can’t “pretend that things can remain the same.” Is she just campaigning? Parliamentary elections are, after all, next week. Or is she finally saying what needs to be said? If things cannot remain the same, will May come out and say what exactly needs to change?

Even if she does mean it, and even if she does spell out what must change, she won’t be able to do anything significant in Parliament because most of the political class will remain opposed to any drastic policy changes.

Our political leaders are basically telling us that this kind of terrorism, random and deadly, is the price we have to pay for their policies of multiculturalism and political correctness. They know that their weak platitudes can’t stop terrorism, and so do the people. They might as well come out and say what they mean: get used to the new normal.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/06/05/london-bridge-world-sick-politicians-downplaying-terrorism/,2017-06-05
London Attack Suggests Stop Pretending Western Values Are Universal,"Speaking at a vigil on Monday for the victims of the recent terrorist attack in London, Mayor Sadiq Khan had a message for the “sick and evil extremists” out there: “As a proud and patriotic British Muslim, I say this: you do not commit these disgusting acts in my name.”

That drew polite applause. He went on, as if to leave no doubt that whatever else the attackers were they were not true Muslims: “Your perverse ideology has nothing to do with the true values of Islam,” adding that a united London stood in defiance of an attack on “our values and our way of life.”

We’ve come to expect such talk from western political elites when they’re confronted with the brutal reality of homegrown Islamist terrorism. But behind these banalities is the great conceit that “western values” are universal. Khan and his milieu are fond of pretending that all Muslims in Britain have more or less the same “values and way of life” as the concertgoers who were blown up last month in Manchester, or the crowds that were attacked while drinking at pubs in Borough Market on Saturday night.

It is not polite to say so, but this is simply not true. Although they might be a minority, a not insignificant number of Muslims in Britain and across Europe do not share Khan’s values or his ideas about Islam. Their numbers and influence is of course a matter of debate, but it is long past time for European leaders to admit that western values are not universal.

If—and it’s a big if—Europe’s political leaders really want to do something to stop these attacks and not simply learn to live with them, they will have to face the reality that many of their own citizens do not much care for western values. And they will have to consider what it might require to address that reality in the years to come.

Not All Muslims Think Like Mayor Khan

On Monday, British officials named two of the three London bridge terrorists: Khuram Shazad Butt, a 27-year-old British citizen born in Pakistan, and Rachid Redouane, a 30-year-old whom police said claimed to be Moroccan and Libyan.

It appears that these men were Muslims—or at least they considered themselves to be Muslims, Khan’s disapproval notwithstanding. Butt was reportedly a member of a group called al-Muhajiroun that supports ISIS and wants Britain to become a Muslim nation. Both men were followers of the radical British cleric Anjem Choudary, who was sentenced to five years in prison last year for supporting ISIS, and according to one neighbor, Butt’s wife wore a face-covering niqab.

Accounts of the attack seem to confirm the terrorists’ motive. The mother of one of the victims told the press that her son had stepped outside the bar when a man ran up to him and said, “This is for my family. This is for Islam,” and stuck a knife in him.

In her remarks Sunday, Prime Minister Theresa May tried her best to speak candidly, saying that Britain “cannot and must not pretend that things can continue as they are.” She’s right about that, and also right that Britain is far too tolerant of extremism (although, like Khan, no mention of what kind of extremism). Stamping it out, she added, “will require some difficult, and often embarrassing, conversations.”

That last phrase is telling. The only possible reason confronting “extremist” views might be embarrassing is because so many British Muslims hold such views—and the prime minister knows it.

Although it’s true that a majority of British Muslims don’t hold extremist views, a sizeable minority don’t exactly hold western views, either. Polls bear this out. Last year, an ICM poll examining the attitudes of British Muslims found that more than half think homosexuality should be illegal. Almost half said they didn’t think it was acceptable for a gay person to be a teacher, nearly a quarter believe that Sharia law should be introduced in some parts of Britain, and 39 percent agreed that “wives should always obey their husbands.”

While some conservative Christians might agree with that last bit, being a fundamentalist Christian doesn’t entail the same sort of beliefs and practices as being a fundamentalist Muslim—things like female genital mutilation and honor killings, both of which are on the rise in Europe (PDF).

As Europe’s Muslim population grows, so grows the ranks of those who adhere to a strict interpretation of their faith, more akin to the way Islam is practiced in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. A survey of 9,000 Europeans published in the Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies in 2015 found that Islamic fundamentalism is not a marginal phenomenon in Europe. The study’s author, Ruud Koopmans, defined religious fundamentalism in three ways: 1) believers should return to the eternal and unchangeable rules laid down in the past; 2) these rules only allow one interpretation and are binding for all believers; 3) religious rules should have priority over secular laws.

The study looked at Turkish and Moroccan immigrants and the children and grandchildren of such immigrants, as well as native European Christians. Based on the study’s parameters, “between 40 percent and 45 percent of European Muslims have fundamentalist religious ideas, that is they agree with the three definitions of the term,” said Koopmans.

The survey found that if each definition is taken individually, across the first and second generations almost 60 percent say they would return to the roots of Islam, 75 percent believe there is only one possible interpretation of the Quran, and 65 percent say that religious rules are more important to them than the laws of their home country. Compare those results to the Christians surveyed, only 4 percent of which agreed with the three definitions of religious fundamentalism.

How Much Do We Really Believe In Western Values?

European leaders know all this. The former head of Britain’s Equality and Human Rights Commission said the findings of the ICM poll were “extremely worrying” and suggested that on many issues British Muslims are a “nation within a nation.”

None of this means that most European Muslims hold radical views or support ISIS. But it does mean that empty slogans about how all of Britain is united are not going to address the problem that the prime minister tried to address in her remarks on Sunday: that Islamic extremism has been given room to breathe in Britain.

The fact is, many thousands of Muslims in Britain, as well as Muslims throughout Europe, do not share what Prime Minister May and Mayor Khan and the rest of the political elite consider to be universal western values. It is uncomfortable, even embarrassing, to admit to ourselves that a great many Muslims in Britain and Europe do not much care for the West as such. Things like gay rights and women’s equality and free speech and the rule of law simply do not demand their respect. They do not cherish western culture or seek to preserve western traditions. Their allegiances lie elsewhere.

It is even more embarrassing to admit that we westerners do not much care for these things ourselves anymore—at least not enough to demand that our fellow countrymen, regardless of religion and creed, adopt them and teach their children to revere them. Until we start demanding that kind of unity, Muslim extremists will have room to breathe in the West.

Wednesday Terror Attack On Tehran A Peek Into Internal Fault Lines,"In an exceedingly rare occurrence, Iran was the target of a coordinated terror attack on Wednesday morning that left at least 12 dead and many more injured. ISIS was quick to claim responsibility for the dual bombings of two symbolic locations in the heart of Tehran, making it the first Islamic State attack in the majority-Shiite Islamic Republic since the group emerged in 2014. Iran subsequently announced that the attackers were Iranian nationals who had joined ISIS.

Iran is looking to place the blame anywhere but on domestic unrest among its Sunni minority. But Iranian Sunnis should expect a harsh crackdown in the weeks and months to come, whether they were involved or not.

The first attack happened at Iran’s parliament, where it appears four men entered the building dressed as women, opened fire, took hostages, and detonated at least one suicide bomb. All four attackers are believed to have been killed. The other attack, involving a female suicide bomber, was launched at the Ayatollah Khomeini mausoleum, a de facto shrine to the founder of the Islamic Republic. Iranian security services say they foiled a third attack, although few details are known.

The locations were carefully selected to strike at the heart of the country. The first, a symbol of Iran’s government, reveals its vulnerability. The second targeted the soul of the country’s revolutionary past. Iran is exceedingly proud that it was able to overthrow the shah in its 1979 revolution and thereby shrug off American influence. In other words, Wednesday’s attacks seem not to have been randomly or spontaneously inspired by ISIS, but carefully planned to hit a nerve and grab international attention.

ISIS’s Increasing Interest in Iran

Surrounding countries have been the targets of Islamic State terror attacks over the last several years but no plot had yet been successfully carried out in Iran, although Iranian officials claim to have foiled several ISIS schemes.

But in recent months, ISIS has ramped up its propaganda in Iran, including publishing, for the first time, four issues of its magazine, Rumiyah, in Persian, and putting out a Persian-language video calling on Iranian Sunnis to rise up against the Shiite government. These aren’t the first instances of Persian-language ISIS propaganda, but they represent a significant increase after years of failing to inspire Iran’s Sunni population to join the Islamic State’s movement.

Some experts have speculated that recruitment efforts were unsuccessful because of Iran’s relative stability, while conflicting reports indicate that Iran has prevented as many as 1,500 Iranians from joining ISIS, likely through Tehran’s notoriously heavy-handed police measures.

So far, nothing is known about the attackers, and Iranian authorities are being characteristically tight-lipped. So it remains unclear whether the recent propaganda push was successful in recruiting Iranian Sunnis to launch the attacks or whether they are the work of ISIS members from Syria or Iraq who infiltrated the country.

Regardless, it represents a significant setback for the Iranian government, which has boasted about how safe Tehran is compared to major cities in neighboring countries (the last major attack in Iran was in 2010 and involved a Sunni extremist group) and has downplayed the threat from ISIS. When the Persian-language ISIS video first came out in March, Iranian officials said it was a sign of Islamic State’s desperation and increasing impotency.

But the group’s ability to coordinate this attack, along with its success in planning and inspiring two attacks in Britain in the past two weeks, shows just how complex the matter is. Losing its territorial holdings—its “caliphate”—does not, it would seem, translate to a decrease in the threat posed by the group in the Middle East or in Europe.

What This Terror Attack Says About What Happens Next

Now that ISIS has proven its capability to strike at the symbolic heart of Iran, expect to see a simultaneous downplaying of the attacks alongside a crackdown on the Sunni population. Iran’s speaker of the parliament has already called Wednesday’s attack a “minor issue.” Above all, Tehran doesn’t want to appear weak or let on that it has domestic problems like other countries in the region that have experienced disastrous instability during and after the Arab Spring.

Iran’s Revolutionary Guard lashed out at the Saudis on Wednesday, claiming they were somehow responsible for the attack, which they also tried to tie to President Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia last month: “World public opinion, especially in Iran, sees the fact that this terrorist act was perpetrated soon after the meeting of the US president with the heads of one of the reactionary regional states that has always supported … terrorists as to be very meaningful.”

This, too, is part of a strategy to deflect the idea that ISIS, or Iran’s Sunni minority population, pose a threat to the regime or the country’s stability. It’s easier for Iran to blame its traditional enemy in the region, the Saudis, and its international nemesis, the Great Satan (America).

But at the same time it downplays the significance of the attacks, expect Iran to crack down on Sunnis within its borders. Sunnis, who make up just 9 percent of Iran’s predominantly Shiite population, already experience persecution in Iran: they are harassed and have been imprisoned, Sunni teachings are reportedly banned in public schools, and Sunni mosques and schools are not allowed to be built.

Their treatment makes them an obvious target for ISIS recruitment, and Iranian officials know it, despite what they say publicly. Whether Wednesday’s attacks turn out to have been perpetrated by Sunni Iranians or ISIS members from outside the country, things are about to get a lot worse for Iran’s Sunni population. Also, the tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, already elevated by the break in diplomatic ties between the Arab Gulf states and Qatar, an Iranian ally, just escalated even more.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/06/08/wednesday-terror-attack-tehran-surprise-peek-internal-fault-lines/,2017-06-08
Why Censoring The Internet Would Make It Harder To Fight Terrorism,"U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May has called for greater regulation of the Internet to combat the growing threat of Islamist extremism. Addressing the public after the latest attack on London—the third act of Islamist terrorism in the U.K. this year—May rightly placed blame for the string of recent attacks on “the evil ideology of Islamist extremism.”

“Defeating this ideology is one of the great challenges of our time,” she said. “But it cannot be defeated by military intervention alone. It will only be defeated when we turn people’s minds away from this violence and make them understand that our values—pluralistic British values—are superior to anything offered by the preachers and supporters of hate.”

To combat this evil ideology, May has proposed greater regulation of the internet, imposed through international agreements, in order to “prevent the spread of extremist and terrorism planning.”

“We cannot allow this ideology the safe space it needs to breed,” May said. “Yet that is precisely what the internet, and the big companies that provide Internet-based services provide.”

Internet Censorship Will Help, Not Hurt, Terrorism

May is yet to outline the details of her proposal. But if initial reports are anything to go by, it is likely to include laws forcing companies to weaken their encryption standards—making all online data less secure—as well as a push for new international agreements that require internet companies to deny a platform to extremist propaganda. In other words, it will be nothing short of a China-style regime of internet censorship—a comparison May has declined to refute.

This proposal has already gained the support of Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, after Australia suffered its own small attack on Monday, when a lone gunman claimed as a “soldier of ISIS” killed one man and took a women hostage. The idea is also likely to gain support from President Trump, who called for “closing that Internet up in some way,” during his campaign.

It is good to see a western political leader facing up to the challenge posed by Islamist ideology. But increased internet censorship is not the solution to this problem. It will only make the problem harder to combat by infringing on legitimate speech, pushing the problem further underground, and leaving the real-life “safe spaces” untouched.

The Internet Isn’t The Real Problem

The internet “safe space” argument is compelling. It’s undeniable that groups like ISIS devote considerable resources to online propaganda, and have motivated people in the west to both join them and to carry out attacks in their homelands. People are right to worry about lone wolves being radicalized on the internet.

But this doesn’t describe the perpetrators of the last three attacks in the U.K., most of whom were already known to the police. Nor does it describe the Australian terrorist, who not only had a history of violence and connections to terrorism, but was out on bail at the time of the attack.

More importantly, it ignores the far greater problem of the safe spaces Islamist extremism benefits from in the real world. For too long terrorist attacks have been met with little more than stoic sympathy and willful blindness, as leaders deny that repeated attacks are anything more than the actions of a few maniacs, with no discernible connection to the religion of Islam.

On the one hand, it’s understandable for political leaders not to want to ascribe blame to the wider Muslim community, the vast majority of whom have nothing whatsoever to do with the barbarism carried out in the name of their religion.

On the other hand, this approach has only exacerbated the problem by insulating the Muslim community—and therefore Islamism—from the sort of criticism that all other groups in western societies are subjected to. In many European countries, this bigotry of low expectations has led to the development of entire suburbs that are de-facto no-go zones—areas of a city that are completely disconnected from wider society, where it’s dangerous for any non-Muslims to enter.

What We Can Learn From Molenbeek

A prime example is the area of Molenbeek, in Belgium, where an alleged participant in the November 13 Paris attacks (which left 130 people dead and 368 wounded) was able to hide out for nearly four months, despite being the most wanted man in Europe. There’s nowhere as bad as Molenbeek in the U.K., but the British Muslim community has nevertheless been afforded the kind of protection from criticism that no other community enjoys.

The harm caused by this insidious political correctness was highlighted in 2014, when an independent inquiry found that police, community leaders, and local politicians had systematically failed to prevent the sexual exploitation of 1,400 children between 1997 and 2013—a figure described as a “conservative estimate”—in the north-England town of Rotherham (population 257,000).

The reason blamed for this failure was the fear of being accused of racism, since these so-called “grooming gangs” were mostly made up of Muslims of Pakistani origin. Even when the crimes were eventually reported, the perpetrators were described as mostly “Asian men,” rather than as Muslims.

Illiberal Ideas Persist In Britain’s Muslim Community

It obviously goes without saying that these appalling crimes are not the fault of all British Muslims, most of whom would be horrified by such behavior. Nevertheless, it highlights the failure of British society to hold the Muslim community to the same standards as everyone else.

It’s undeniable that appallingly illiberal views have been allowed to persist in the British Muslim community. In a 2015 poll of 1,000 British Muslim, 27 percent said they have some sympathy for the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris. An additional 2016 poll found that two out of three British Muslims would not report someone they knew to the police, if they became involved with terrorist sympathizers. These sentiments aren’t new. A 2006 poll found that 20 percent of British Muslism had sympathy for the motivations of the London bombings of July 7, 2005 (which left 52 people dead and 784 injured).

It’s unlikely that these attitudes, which are alarmingly out of step with the rest of British society, would still exist if not for their “safe spaces,” created by the taboo on criticism of Islam. The first step to combating Islamist extremism is to remove this taboo.

Internet Censorship Will Make Things Worse

Not only will increasing internet censorship do nothing to remove the safe-spaces that exist in the real world, it may even make the problem worse.

There is simply no way to completely censor anything in the internet age. All states can do is push ideas and discussions further underground, where the ideas are harder to combat and where it is harder for intelligence services to keep track of them—a point stressed by the U.K.’s leading digital advocacy organization, the Open Rights Group.

There is also a long track record of anti-free speech laws—designed to protect the public from harmful speech—being used suppress discussion of important issues, simply because they are controversial and may offend some people. In 2016, Dutch politician Geert Wilders was found guilty of violating Hate Speech laws for comments he made in 2014 that were “demeaning and thereby insulting towards the Moroccan population.” Wilders had asked a roomful of his supporter if they wanted to have “more or fewer Moroccans” in the country. When the crowd shouted back “Fewer!” he replied, “Well, we’ll take care of that.”

In the recent March 15 election, Wilders’ party got over 1.3 million votes (13.6 percent), so he clearly represents a significant proportion of the Dutch population. He would not have this support if the issues he talks about didn’t resonate with the public. Ironically, these are the same issues that May’s proposal is attempting to address—namely, the spread of radical Islamism.

This Could Be An Excuse to Suppress More Than Terrorism

People might disagree with the solutions Wilders proposes, but this is not the way to combat unwanted ideas. No one is served when we collectively decide to stick our heads in the sand. The problem will not magically disappear.

There is every reason to expect that May’s internet censorship proposal will also be used to suppress more than just Islamist propaganda. Perhaps the best evidence of this is a private conversation between German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, which was picked up by a hot mic in 2015. Merkel was overheard asking Zuckerberg what he was doing about anti-immigrant posts on Facebook. Zuckerberg’s response was, “We need to do some work.” Make no mistake, this was nothing short of an attempt to reduce opposition to Merkel’s unprecedented decision to open Germany’s borders to a seemingly unlimited number of refugees and migrants from the Middle East and North Africa.

May’s internet censorship proposal will create the infrastructure for politicians like Merkel to not just ask internet companies to act, but demand it.

Free Speech Is The Best Way To Combat Extremism

Several European countries introduced Hate Speech laws in order to prevent the sort of anti-Semitism that led to the Holocaust. However, not only have these laws failed to eradicate anti-Semitism, it is now widely reported to be on the rise throughout Europe. The situation has gotten so bad, some people are now discussing whether it’s time for the Jews to leave Europe, for good.

The situation could not be more different in the United States, which has become arguably the safest country for Jews on earth. The U.S. is also significantly better than Europe at integrating its immigrant population, including its Muslim population. This is because of the First Amendment, which helps ensure the existence of a vibrant and robust marketplace of ideas in which extremist propaganda can be combatted. This is an important lesson for western societies to learn: Free speech is the best way to combat unwanted ideas.

The western world needs to combat the ideology of radical Islamism. But this is only possible if we can openly discuss issues, free from the kind of politically correct taboos that have insulated the Muslim community. May’s internet censorship proposal will only make this more difficult.

Why The American Imam Who Inspired London Attack Can’t Be Stopped,"After every Islamist terror attack, investigators search for clues for what inspired the attackers and who helped them. Since the rise of the Islamic State, this has often meant looking for local recruiters or for connections to ISIS members in Syria or Iraq.

But some of the most influential radical clerics who have played a crucial role in recruiting and inspiring terrorists live in Western countries. Take Anjem Choudary, the British Salafist “hate preacher” who was convicted last year for inviting support for ISIS, after two decades of preaching Islamic domination, praising terrorists, and having connections with Islamist networks throughout Europe. There’s also the case of Musa Cerantonio, the Australian convert to Islam and popular radical preacher who on social media urged Muslims to join ISIS.

After the London Bridge attack that killed seven and injured 48 nearly two weeks ago, the clues are pointing in an unusual direction: America.

Khuram Butt, one of the London Bridge attackers, was allegedly an avid follower of a radical Salafist Islamic preacher, Ahmad Musa Jibril, who lives in Dearborn, Michigan. One of Butt’s friends told the BBC in an interview that his friend listened to Jibril’s sermons, which he called “very radical.” He was so concerned that he called the British government’s anti-terror hotline to alert them. The man went on to tell the BBC, “I am surprised this stuff is still on YouTube and is easily accessible.”

Here is the crux of the issue: how is a radical cleric, who was well-known to authorities, able to keep inflammatory Islamist sermons posted online without any pushback from authorities? What can social media companies and websites do to take down this kind of content? And to what extent is it their responsibility to do so?

Ahmad Jibril Is Apparently Very Influential for ISIS

So just how effective is Jibril? He is considered one of the most influential online clerics for followers of ISIS and radical Islam more generally. According to the deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, Jibril’s “prominence is second only to (the late Yemeni-American cleric) Anwar Awlaki” among English-speaking ISIS supporters.

Awlaki, a U.S.-born cleric, was a top recruiter for al-Qaeda. He preached from his Virginia mosque to three of the 9/11 attackers, presided over the funeral of Fort Hood shooter Nadal Hasan’s mother, and is thought to have helped plan the attempted Christmas 2009 bombing of a Northwest flight into Detroit.

In 2014, the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization and Political Violence (ICSR) studied the Facebook pages of Syrian foreign fighters, including those fighting with ISIS and the al-Qaeda-linked al Nusra Front, and found that 20.9 percent of those examined had liked Jibril’s page (second place went to Cerantonio). At the time the report was released, Jibril’s fan page had more than 145,000 likes. It currently has 247, 242, despite being inactive since July 2014. As of the ICSR report, 60 percent of foreign fighters with Twitter accounts followed him. The ICSR found Jibril to be the most popular clerical authority for foreign fighters.

Their report on foreign fighter networks describes Jibril’s tactics:

Jibril is not a conventional cleric. It should be pointed out that Jibril does not openly incite his followers to violence nor does he explicitly encourage them to join the Syrian jihad. Instead, he adopts the role of a cheerleader: supporting the principles of armed opposition to Assad, often in highly emotive terms, while employing extremely charged religious or sectarian idioms. The general demeanour of his posturing towards the West is confrontational and distrusting, fuelling the perception of a Western conspiracy against both Islam and Muslims.

Jibril has been tied to two other cases in which men in the Detroit area are accused of ties with ISIS. Both men listened to Jibril’s sermons.

The Conflict Between Terrorism and Free Speech

Jibril, who has his own channel on YouTube, is important in part because he’s able to reach out to and communicate with English-speaking Muslims in the West. But he’s also a crucial tool in reaching out to Western Muslims because he’s spreading his message from the safety of the United States, where his speech is highly protected.

Were Jibril living in Europe, authorities perhaps would have arrested him back in 2014 during the surge in foreign fighters going to fight with ISIS, or would have taken his content down (YouTube has declined to take down the videos in question). America provides a shield for preachers like him because of how seriously our country takes individual freedom of expression.

The two primary exceptions to the First Amendment are what’s known as “fighting words,” words said to another individual to which any reasonable person would respond with violence (a subjective but fairly high bar), and incitement to violence. The latter case only applies if it can be shown the speech is intended to produce “imminent lawless action” and is likely to do so. Neither of these would apply to a cleric like Jibril, who has been careful not to call explicitly on Muslims to join ISIS.

The U.S. government instead tries to get ISIS propaganda off the Internet through cyberattacks, but as a recent New York Times report details, these efforts are failing because of the group’s nimble ability to get its materials back up soon after they’ve been taken down. But even if those efforts weren’t inadequate, it wouldn’t help with Jibril because he’s not technically doing anything wrong.

If the government’s hands are tied, what about social media companies? Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, and YouTube all announced in December that they would improve their reaction time in taking down “the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos” by intelligence sharing between companies. The plan involves creating a database of unique digital “fingerprints” to help identify those images and videos to remove them swiftly.

But, again, Jibril was more careful than that, and his sermons and materials clearly have not been removed from any of these sites. What’s more, ISIS is shifting its tactics, using more end-to-end encryption apps like Telegram and WhatsApp to recruit and communicate.

So what can the FBI or other law enforcement do in a case like this? Nothing. The only way to stop someone like Jibril would be to fundamentally change our country’s system of governance. It would require an overhaul of America’s conception of free speech, essentially making it subjective to whichever party is in power, a highly dangerous proposition. Or it would entail radical changes to the Fourth Amendment, lowering the bar for requests for wiretaps and other kinds of surveillance of people suspected of having ties to terror groups.

The bottom line is that if we want better security at home we’re going to have fewer freedoms. That’s a slippery slope, and we know where it ends. So, dismal though the forecast might be, men like Jibril cannot be silenced, and can go on influencing and inspiring would-be jihadists.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/06/16/american-imam-inspired-london-bridge-attack-cant-stopped/,2017-06-16
New Kind Of Terror In London Sees Potential Vigilante Attacking Muslims,"Late Sunday night, a van veered into a crowd of people in London, sending nine to the hospital. One man has died, although it’s unclear whether his injuries were a result of the incident. British authorities are calling it a terror attack.

But what makes this attack different than the London Bridge attack two weeks ago, the Manchester bombing in May, or the Westminster Bridge attack earlier this year, is that rather than being perpetrated by a Muslim man who had pledged his allegiance to ISIS, it was targeting Muslims.

The attack took place at about midnight on Sunday night, just as worshipers were exiting a mosque in Finsbury Park after a special Ramadan service. There are reports that the driver, Darren Osborne, a 47-year-old-man from Cardiff who was arrested, made anti-Islamic remarks while trying unsuccessfully to flee the scene.

Of course, we don’t know the attacker’s reasons for attacking this specific mosque, but it’s interesting to note that the Finsbury Park Mosque, was once, as The New York Times puts it, “a hotbed of Islamist militants,” although it purportedly reconstituted itself 12 years ago and has a “new ethos,” according to the mosque’s website. It seems likely that Osborne chose this mosque intentionally, although we won’t know for sure until he has been interviewed and more information is released.

When People Think Government Is Failing to Protect Them

What we do know is that Osborne perversely adopted a tactic that the Islamic State recommends to would-be jihadists—plowing into a crowd with a large vehicle—which capitalizes on minimum planning and produces maximum damage. This was the same tactic used in the London and Westminster Bridge attacks, and the same as was used last year in Nice, when a Tunisian man drove a truck into revelers at a Bastille Day celebration, taking the lives of 86 people.

This new kind of terror is an ominous sign for Britain, where the government has proven itself unable to prevent terror attacks after it emerged that the perpetrators involved in the attacks on the concert in Manchester and the London Bridge were already known to British police. Britons are understandably feeling frustrated and don’t believe their government can keep them safe.

With the spike in recent terrorist attacks in Britain and the ever-present politically correct rhetoric from Western leaders that accompanies them, there’s a sense in which something like this was inevitable. The frustration, fear, and anger finally boiled over into one man’s decision to target random and innocent Muslims. Osborne is reported to have said “I did my bit” after bystanders tackled him to the ground.

Sunday night’s attack targeting Muslims comes not only after a spike in terror attacks, but also amid a backdrop of British authorities looking the other way when Muslims commit crimes. That’s exactly what happened with the much-reported Rotherham scandal in 2014, in which men of Pakistani origin ran a child sex ring involving approximately 1,400 girls. British police refused to take action out of fear of appearing racist. Despite widespread coverage and condemnation, last year it came out that the problem was ongoing.

This kind of hyper-sensitivity toward the Muslim community in Britain, and a sense, real or not, among many non-Muslims that there are no consequences for wrong-doing in that community, has left many feeling resentful and impotent.

Resentment Rarely Ends Well

Muslim leaders have long expressed concerns that reporting on terror attacks perpetrated by Muslims and calling out radical Islamist ideology would result in Islamaphobic attacks. But it’s unclear what, exactly, those leaders would have suggested as an alternative. Would it have been better if no one mentioned the motives of attackers who had pledged allegiance to Islamic State?

Probably not. That’s because it’s exactly that kind of censorship and equivocation that has contributed to the anger and resentment many feel in the wake of every new ISIS attack.

Just to be absolutely clear, there is no excuse for what this man did, nor is it the fault of Muslim or Western leaders. Osborne alone is responsible for his unconscionable actions. But in order to prevent future attacks of this nature, and to prevent Britain’s security situation from spiraling out of control, it’s crucial that we understand the environment that contributed to this event.

It’s also important, as we move forward and as we condemn this monstrous act, that we also understand the differences between this and the previous attacks in London. Several news organizations, in reporting this story, have referred to it as the latest in a string of terror attacks in the country, and it is. But it’s an attack of a very different sort that bears noting, and it portends something wholly new.

Although more attacks against British Muslims may come, there’s little evidence so far to suggest any kind of organized group, unified belief system, or ideology motivates any such attacks, present or future. That’s a significant difference that affects both the nature of the threat and how the British police will investigate this and any future attacks.

What the mosque attack does suggest is that Britain is at a dangerous boiling point and that the violence is now coming from both sides of the spectrum. If British authorities can’t prove that they are capable of handling the ongoing threat from ISIS among Britain’s own Muslim citizens—and given the flood of British ISIS fighters returning home, it’s unlikely they’ll be able to—we can expect more of these “counter-attacks” on British Muslims. And that’s the last thing Britain needs right now.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/06/20/new-kind-terror-london-sees-potential-vigilante-attacking-muslims/,2017-06-20
Who Does The FBI Work For?,"If you work for any extended amount of time in Washington, you are likely to meet people who work within the intelligence and law enforcement communities. You learn to recognize potential sources and those who will never be. The bad sources love to tell stories, so many stories, with at least a veneer of truth. The good sources will tell far fewer stories, but only when it’s important. But the most frequent stories you will hear, from good and bad, are stories of internal dysfunction and irresponsible uses of power. This is not confined to one administration or another, but is a recurring and expected fact of life within the agencies that ought to be focused on securing our liberties and protecting us from threats, foreign and domestic, not spying on an ex, using taxpayer funds for professional gain, or preventing the return of a romantic rival by adding them to a watch list. Once you’ve heard enough of these stories, a realization may dawn on you: these institutions are as dysfunctional as all the others, with their own internal politics, defects, aspiring people, and conflicted forces that often cross the lines of law and ethics in pursuit of their goals. Not losing faith in them at that juncture is a difficult thing indeed.

That brings us to yesterday’s FBI briefing on the shooting targeting Republicans in Alexandria, a briefing that could not be more bizarre in its content and its conclusions. Mollie Hemingway has more:

“The FBI admits that Hodgkinson: vociferously raged against Republicans in online forums, had a piece of paper bearing the names of six members of Congress, was reported for doing target practice outside his home in recent months before moving to Alexandria, had mapped out a trip to the DC area, took multiple photos of the baseball field he would later shoot up, three days after the New York Times mentioned that Republicans practiced baseball at an Alexandria baseball field with little security, lived out of his van at the YMCA directly next door to the baseball field he shot up, legally purchased a rifle in March 2003 and 9 mm handgun “in November 2016,” modified the rifle at some point to accept a detachable magazine and replaced the original stock with a folding stock, rented a storage facility to hide hundreds of rounds of ammunition and additional rifle components, asked “Is this the Republican or Democrat baseball team?” before firing on the Republicans, ran a Google search for information on the “2017 Republican Convention” hours before the shooting, and took photos at high-profile Washington locations, including the east front plaza of the U.S. Capitol and the Dirksen Senate Office.



“We know from other reporting that the list was of six Republican Freedom Caucus members, including Rep. Mo Brooks, who was present at the practice.



“So what does the FBI decide this information means? Well, the takeaway of the briefing was characterized well by the Associated Press headline about it: “FBI: Gunman who shot congressman had no target in mind.” The Associated Press reported the FBI: believes the gunman “had no concrete plan to inflict violence” against Republicans, “had not yet clarified who, if anyone, he planned to target, or why,” believes he may have just “happened upon” the baseball game the morning of June 14, and that the attack appeared “spontaneous,” are unclear on the “context” of Hodgkinson’s note with six names of members of Congress, does not believe that photographs of the baseball field or other sites “represented surveillance of intended targets,” and “painted a picture of a down-on-his-luck man with few future prospects.”



“In fact, USA Today went with “FBI offers portrait of troubled Alexandria shooter with ‘anger management problem’” for their headline, since that’s what the FBI emphasized in the briefing.”

There’s also this incredible tidbit, which somehow has received little to no attention: “Hodgkinson also visited the office of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose campaign he had worked on as a volunteer, and was in email contact with the two Democratic senators from his home state.” If this was a shooter who had worked for Ted Cruz and was in contact via email with both of the Senators from Texas, wouldn’t we know about it?

There’s no reason to beat around the bush here: what the FBI is claiming is mind-boggling when they claim the shooter had no target in mind. Consider the number of accidents of circumstance you would have to believe were going on here to not have the shooter doing what seems obvious from every piece of evidence we have: researching and planning for an attack on Republicans of some kind, particularly looking for an opportunity when security will be low and vulnerability will be high. This was an attack, not an “anger management” problem.

Step back, though, and think on the institutional conclusions here. Considering how ludicrous the FBI’s conclusions are as it relates to an attack on the third ranking member of the House of Representatives, you might reconsider whether to trust the FBI’s conclusions in other areas, as well. And this is how our faith in institutions is degraded: steadily, gradually, with incident after incident where men in suits stand in front of microphones and make claims we know are not the whole truth.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/06/22/who-does-the-fbi-work-for/,2017-06-22
Aftermath Of Alexandria Shooting Showed Left's Bullying At Its Worst,"James T. Hodgkinson of Belleville, Illinois arrived in a D.C. suburb several months ago and lived out of his van next to a small local baseball field, which had recently been reported as the site of Republican congressional baseball practice. He took pictures of this otherwise unremarkable locale, and showed up there last Wednesday with two guns and a list of six elected Republicans on his person. He verified with a member of Congress that they were indeed Republicans on the field before opening fire, attempting to murder a bunch of them.

A week later, one of the victims, Rep. Steve Scalise, had been smeared by one national media figure and told his wound was “self-inflicted” by a nightly news anchor while he was still in the hospital fighting for his life. Republicans had been scolded for not changing their views on the Second Amendment in response to being attacked, and national media had either moved on from the story or moved on to scolding Republicans for their reaction to it.

Rep. Mo Brooks faced the question about his Second Amendment views just minutes after someone literally tried to murder him. Can we take a moment to think about how utterly crass this is? Imagine an abortion bomber blowing up a Planned Parenthood grand opening in Washington DC, injuring members of Congress in attendance. Then imagine most national news coverage including this question for their colleagues who escaped maiming: “Shouldn’t you probably consider changing your views on abortion? Maybe pass some common-sense limits on it?”

Yet Brooks offered a competent, calm civics class on the subject to anyone who was willing to listen.

Media Doesn’t Want to Talk About What Really Happened

National media covered the incident voraciously for several hours, but within a day, most had moved on to another leak in the Russia story. Less than 48 hours after a multiple assassination attempt on members of Congress, there were no media vans or cameras at the Alexandria baseball field where it occurred. Just for perspective, when Republican staffer Elizabeth Lauten committed the offense of writing something critical of President Obama’s daughters on her private Facebook page, news cameras were camped on her parents’ lawn staking her out for the better part of a week.

When the press was covering the shooting, it was mostly a gauzy, imprecise discussion of how “rhetoric” might have caused it, which means we’re in the business of determining whose rhetoric to stifle to prevent further violence. Wouldn’t you know it? The answer was… Donald Trump’s rhetoric, which has the magical power to compel a Bernie volunteer to shoot a long-time Trump-supporting Republican. Way to go on the narrative assist, there, Rep. Mark Sanford.

The New York Times went so far as to repeat a long-debunked lie blaming Sarah Palin’s political speech for the wholly unrelated shooting of Rep. Gabby Giffords in an attempt to make Republicans culpable in a scenario in which Republicans were shot. All of its fact-checkers were presumably engaged in checking the statements of Republicans blaming Democratic rhetoric for the shooting, because those are their priorities. (For what it’s worth, I’ve been on record for a long time about how it’s unwise to conflate political speech with violence in a country that values free speech.)

Let’s Talk about How the Victims Responded, Instead

Less than a week after the shooting, there was a high-profile House election in Georgia—the most expensive House race in history. The Republican candidate Karen Handel had been specifically named by Hodgkinson in one of his anti-Republican Facebook rants. When I say named, I mean he called her a “shit” then exhorted his followers to “Vote Blue!” This tidbit got only the briefest of mentions outside local news, as did the threatening letters containing white powder Handel and her neighbors received days before the election. The powder turned out to be non-toxic.

Hodgkinson’s attempted massacre was not part of media coverage of GA-6 despite his act of intimidation having clear implications there. Targeting a specific population for its beliefs usually has a secondary consequence—to cow the members of the community the murderer didn’t succeed in killing. Would Republican voters be intimidated into staying home or emboldened by this attack on elected Republicans? It seems like an interesting question in a special election where turnout is important and unpredictable, yet it was rarely if ever discussed.

Instead, the only time the shooting came up in national media coverage of GA-6 was when an outside group ran a small, ham-handed ad tying Democratic rhetoric to the shooting. The ad was promptly, rightly denounced by Handel, but the scolding coverage of the ad went on for a day. My, how quickly we move in the news cycle from Republicans literally shot to Republican overreach about Republicans being literally shot.

Handel’s win thanks to the turnout of Republicans could and should have been celebrated as a defiant stand by free citizens in the face of an attack meant to scare them out of engaging in democracy. Exercising your right to vote then celebrating an electoral victory are very healthy ways to defy a gunman who tried to kill people who share your beliefs.

Instead, in the wake of Handel’s solid win, which snatched the #Resistance’s longed-for victory, Washington Post writer Dave Weigel scolded Republicans for “dunking” on Democrats despite everyone’s one-day indulgence of “come together” rhetoric, as if four hours of praise-hands emoji and super-hot memes on Twitter is part of the “climate of hate.”

In our hypothetical above about an attack on elected officials at Planned Parenthood, imagine a loudly pro-choice candidate winning an important, high-profile victory less than a week later and the news media tsk-tsking Emily’s List for celebrating that win.

Conservatives Can’t Be Victims Even When They’re Shot

Finally, to cap the week, the FBI offered a bizarre assessment of the shooting that ignored the plain significance of all of the established facts of the case to declare it a “spontaneous” attack with “no target.” What perverse standards. A Republican congressman is fighting for his life in a hospital thanks to a partisan attacker, but let’s examine on national TV several times over how he kind of had it coming because of his politics.

Republicans literally had guns held to their heads, so they should renounce their rights to armed self-defense?

Republicans were victims of a multiple assassination attempt, and it warrants half the coverage of the assassination attempt on a Democrat six years earlier?

Republicans were shot by a partisan political adversary, so they should be careful how much they celebrate electoral wins?

It all revealed once again the overweening cultural hubris of the American Left, which has been in control of so many institutions and the prevailing political narrative for so long, it can’t conceive of Republicans as victims even when they’re being shot. Many of them are cultural bullies convinced of their righteousness, and as Reid did, they’ll kick you when you’re down after being shot on a baseball field. Why, it’s enough to drive you to hire a giant, coarse, shameless bully of your own and make him president.

When you look at it that way, it’s not at all surprising that Handel beat newcomer Jon Osoff, who didn’t live in the district, but showed up to it with cargo planes full of cash from San Francisco. Democrats hadn’t paid attention to this district for years, so their moneyed, white-knight act was bad enough. But in the context of the shooting of Republicans that very week, the aftermath of which showed media and the Left indulging in some of their very worst tendencies, it was utterly preposterous.

Voters have been telling pollsters since Trump was elected: Sure, we don’t love him, but we love Democrats less. When it comes to the crucial in- or out-of-touch metric, Trump and Republicans have been seen as more in touch with the problems of average Americans than Democrats have.

The behavior of many on the Left and in elite institutions this week sent a message, very loud and clear, that not only do they not “get” the other half of the country; they don’t want to. They’re not only out of touch; they think the rest of you are untouchables.

Feminist writer Jill Filipovic’s Twitter thread exemplified the extreme, though not terribly uncommon, version of this sentiment after Osoff’s loss.

https://twitter.com/JillFilipovic/status/877438972506648576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fthefdrlst.wpengine.com%2F2017%2F06%2F21%2Fthe-10-most-hysterical-liberal-responses-to-handels-win%2F

Republicans released a draft bill of the Senate version of their health-care reform efforts Thursday. Liberal darling Sen. Elizabeth Warren declared, “I’ve read the Republican ‘health care’ bill. This is blood money. They’re paying for tax cuts with American lives.”

You want to go that route while one of your colleagues is still in the hospital recovering from a gunshot wound? Go for it, but don’t be surprised when it doesn’t play in Peoria.

Cosmopolitan Blames A Violent Rape On The Pro-Life Movement,"Reaching what can only be described as a new, heartbreaking low, Cosmopolitan ran an article this week arguing that opposition to abortion leads not just to “extreme violence,” but—at least in one case—to rape.

In doing so, the so-called “women’s” magazine could be allowing a North Carolina rapist to stay free and unaccountable for his crime.

The goal of the piece, written by Rebecca Grant, was made plain by its headline: “She Told a Guy She Worked at an Abortion Clinic. On Their Next Date, He Raped Her: Clinic director Calla Hales was a victim of the extreme violence abortion providers face simply for doing their jobs and helping women.”

Using a rape Hales says she suffered in late 2015 as a fulcrum, Cosmopolitan leverages her story to try and demonstrate that the attack itself—rather than an isolated, yet horrific, instance of violence—is indicative of swelling anti-abortion extremism at-large.

As the headline indicates, Hales says her attacker turned violent after she told him she worked at A Preferred Women’s Health Center (APWHC), a chain of four abortion businesses in North Carolina and Georgia.

On Hales’ telling of the attack, the man sexually assaulted her at the end of their second date, making his motivations clear even while he was raping her:

“He had me in between the seats, wrapped the seat belt around my neck, and at some point, bit me on my chest,” Hales said. “He said things like I should have expected this and that I deserved it. He asked how I could live with myself and said I should repent. That I was a jezebel. That I was a murderer. That he was doing no worse to me than I had done to women. He said he would make me remember him.”

Though she’s willing to tell her story through Cosmopolitan, Hales declined to report her attacker’s name—even after she says the man showed up at one of her clinics on multiple occasions to harass her as part of a larger group of pro-lifers who gather regularly to protest APWHC’s abortion practice.

Hales goes further during the article, in fact, telling Grant that her rapist followed up the initial attack with intimidating text messages and phone calls, and told the other pro-life demonstrators intimate details about Hale so that they could harass her as well.

Hales’ reluctance to report her attacker to police is surely understandable. What’s more difficult to reconcile is how Hales could be too afraid of the rapist’s “retribution”—as she puts it— to report him to the police, yet comfortable enough to tell the whole world about the incident through Cosmopolitan.

The Real Culprit: Pro-Lifers?

While casting those on the other side of a debate in the worst possible light is a time-honored—albeit, sleazy—way to look like you’ve won an argument, Cosmopolitan’s capitalizing on Hales’ story to sling mud at the pro-life movement is beyond the pale by any measure.

There’s no reason to doubt Hales’ story in and of itself. It could very well be that her rapist is a walking contradiction, pronouncing a high value for human life on one hand, yet dehumanizing others—even to the point of raping those with whom he disagrees.

To take Hales at her word, the man who raped her is driven by a deep, vile disregard for the sanctity and dignity of human life. That he justifies rape by condemning abortion only makes him what he already is—an evil man justifying an evil act.

Yet, rather than showing a proper zeal to bring this man to justice and—at the very least—protect his future victims from the crimes he’s sure to commit, Cosmopolitan shows it’s far more committed to “winning” the abortion debate than actually helping women and advancing their role in the world.

If the rapist gets a free pass this time around because Cosmopolitan is too busy grinding its axes, well that’s just the price of doing business.

After all, we all know who’s responsible for this rape: pro-lifers who have the gall to stand outside of abortion clinics and offer a woman in an unexpected pregnancy a better way forward.

Violence at Abortion Clinics is Actually Trending Downward

Opening the article with the story of Hales’ sexual assault, Grant backtracks to tell readers that Hales’ parents purchased APWHC when she was 8 years old, so she grew up learning to live in a contentious environment as a result.

Curiously, Grant then goes on to cite a 2016 National Abortion Federation report that actually shows incidences of violence against abortion businesses on a steep downturn over the past seven years. By NAF’s count, even non-violent crimes such as trespassing fell by more than 53 percent from 2010 to 2016 as compared to 2000-09.

Nevertheless, Grant attempts to prove that a rise in reported picketing in front of abortion clinics is tied to Hales’ rape:

In its 2016 report, the National Abortion Federation (NAF), which monitors clinic harassment and violence, found that picketing, vandalism, obstruction, invasion, trespassing, burglary, stalking, assault and battery, and bomb threats are all on the rise. Clinics reported 60,000 incidents of picketing that year, an all-time high since the NAF began tracking these statistics in 1977. The report also documented a five-fold increase in hate speech and internet harassment, which escalated after the election. The 2016 National Clinic Violence Survey, published by the Feminist Majority Foundation, found that the percentage of clinics reporting the most severe types of anti-abortion violence and threats of violence has dramatically increased from the first six months of 2014 to the first six months of 2016 — from 19.7 percent to 34.2 percent. Hales was raped in November 2015. Now abortion rights advocates fear the violence and harassment may get even worse. The Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act, passed in 1994, made it a federal crime to use force, threat of force, or physical obstruction to interfere with a person’s right to obtain or provide reproductive health services, but it’s only effective if enforced.

Cosmopolitan’s argument is clear, and becomes even more pronounced as the article moves along: picketing abortion clinics leads to violent assaults and rape. It’s hard to dream up a more ironclad fusion of Slippery Slope and Guilt by Association fallacies than that.

Blame the Actual Perpetrator, Cosmo

In its failed, slanderous attempt to tie Hales’ rape to an uptick in abortion-clinic violence that isn’t actually happening, Cosmopolitan is actually doing something far more dangerous in the long run.

While Grant and Cosmopolitan spill plenty of ink and pixels blaming abortion opponents for violent attacks like the one Hales suffered, their own reporting—if true—concedes that a violent sexual predator is still on the loose because Hales refuses to report him to the police.

Rather than inspiring rape victims like Hales to defend themselves—at the very least—through the legal system, Cosmopolitan pins the blame on pro-lifers who oppose an industry that not only takes a million human lives every year in the U.S. alone, but routinely covers for rapists and other sexual predators in order to keep up its profit margin.

Calla Hales and other rape victims deserve far better than this. Rather than exploitation as a pro-abortion mascot, they deserve help and healing from assaults that are in no way their own fault.

Hales’ attacker deserves to be brought to justice for his crime, and his future victims deserve protection from a violent madman.

And those on both sides of the abortion divide deserve the basic decency it takes to cast blame on actual perpetrators, refusing the ever-growing urge to slander those with whom we disagree.

A Muslim Reformer Explains How To Fight Islamism,"Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser is president and founder of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy (AIFD), co-founder of the Muslim Reform Movement (MRM), and author of “A Battle for the Soul of Islam: An American Muslim Patriot’s Fight to Save His Faith.” He is a practicing Muslim who has actively opposed Islamism.

Jasser is an active physician and former U.S. Navy officer whose parents fled Syria in the 1960s, and host of the Blaze Radio Podcast “Reform This!” and founder of TakeBackIslam.com.

The author interviewed him in January on the Muslim Reform Movement, Islamism, and the war in Syria. This is a follow-up interview. Jasser agreed to discuss Islamism and searching for its antidote in the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Middle East.

Lessons from London

Q (Postal): As a co-founder of the Muslim Reform Movement, what lessons do you want the West to learn from the recent terrorist attacks in the United Kingdom?

A (Jasser): We in the free world cannot ever afford to be complacent. Military victories in Iraq and Syria will increase ISIS’ global chatter calling for acts of war against the West and subsequent attempts at more attacks will follow. The emergence of ISIS in 2013 after the diminishment of al-Qaeda by 2008 should serve as a reminder that we are in a long global war against militant Islamism, and more broadly non-violent Islamism.

The precursor of violent Islamism and violent jihad is non-violent Islamism and its civilizational jihad. Islamists of any variety divide the world into the “Land of Islam” (Dar-al-Islam) and the “Land of War” (Dar al-Harb). Islamists will continue to promote the consciousness that non-Muslim majority nations are the “Land of War.”

Nearly every one of these attacks is following the same pattern and we should learn from them. Sadly, we are not. The perpetrators over and over prove to be “known wolves” (radicals already on the radar of security apparatuses). The concept of a “lone wolf” is a fictitious construct absolving non-violent Islamists of any responsibility.

Islamists know that the greatest threat to their supremacist program is when we advance the ideas of liberty, freedom, and universal values of human rights protected by secular national identity. That is the only antidote to Islamism (political Islam and the idea of an Islamic state). The means of terror has now morphed from suicide belts and bombs to vehicular jihad and machetes. While we must learn to confront this changing landscape, we must see all these attacks for what they are: the very tip of the iceberg, the militant violent expressions of the massive global Islamist movement.

We can and will continue to fight this war in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Libya. But victories there are only pyrrhic and fleeting. In order for the West to see a day free from wars against Islamist terror and its caliphate(s), we must wage an ideological war to influence the minds of Muslims against political Islam.

Muslim reformers have a laboratory here in the West to dissect theocratic Islam in ways that just cannot be done in any Muslim-majority nation. We, for example, reached out with a plea to Ariana Grande for her to use her enormous cultural platform of millions to empower Muslim reformers to become ambassadors of freedom, gender equality, sexual identity, free speech and all the issues that distinguish us from Islamist societies and their sharia states. Unfortunately, her One Love benefit concert was another in a long history of lost opportunities.

Q: One of the London bridge terrorists (Khuram Butt) reportedly viewed sermons online by Ahmad Musa Jibril, an Islamist preacher in Dearborn, Michigan, who praises violent jihad. Butt also allegedly associated with Islamist preacher Anjem Choudary, who is set to be released from prison next year after calling for British Muslims to support ISIS in 2013. (You called for his arrest seven years ago). How should U.S. and U.K. authorities, and Muslim communities in those countries, deal with Islamist websites, preachers, and mosques in the future?

A: Essentially, once homeland security agents finally shift their focus to “Countering Violent Islamism” (CVI) all Islamist groups and individuals can be rightfully viewed by authorities as possible cultivators of violent Islamism. Individuals are not “radicalized” on the Internet. Their ideas are brewed in a local cauldron of Islamism that then drives them towards further Islamism and jihadism.

The Internet is merely a tool for the already radicalized Islamist. Islamist ideas include antipathy for Western society, governments, military, and foreign policy. Islamists are misogynists and anti-Semites. They obsess with conspiracy theories and condition Muslims to always be victims and bear grievances against non-Muslims. Islamist grievance groups in the West, such as most Muslim Brotherhood legacy groups, are the first steps in Muslim radicalization.

Authorities should closely monitor Islamist speech short of advocacy of violence and war against the West, in addition to obviously treasonous speech advocated by clerics like Anjem Choudary. Authorities shouldn’t evaluate those who have traveled abroad or are connected to known militants in a vacuum, but rather drill down on the ideological adherence to elements of the Islamist movement.

We should also, however, not fall prey to the autocratic inclination of just shutting down non-violent Islamist and jihadi-sympathizing mosques. Rather, our entire security apparatus domestically (DHS) and abroad (DOD and State) should be mapping and monitoring their public (not private) footprints. Our Muslim Reform Movement’s declaration is an ideological firewall that can be used to determine which Muslim groups are part of the problem and which Muslim groups are part of the solution.

Q: The United Kingdom is monitoring up to 23,000 Islamists as “subjects of interest,” and yet Khuram Butt, the Manchester terrorist (Salman Abedi) and the Westminster terrorist (Khalid Masood) were able to successfully carry out attacks despite being previously monitored or investigated. What can the United States learn from this to prevent further attacks? How should the United States deal with its “known wolves,” as you like to call them?

A: The central axis upon which our homeland security focus is currently centered is labeled “CVE: Countering Violent Extremism.” Thus, our agents are not told or encouraged to focus on obvious precursor Islamist ideologies to that violence but rather somehow they are supposed to focus on the moment some non-descript extremism becomes violent. This is impossible, as our agents hamstring themselves waiting for that virtual needle in a haystack.

In the United Kingdom, they are following 23,000 suspects looking for both a confirmed predilection for violence and also an imminent threat. A security strategy that only focuses on behavior will fail over and over as we have seen. Many so-called “violent extremists” have no violent precursors, but Islamist extremists always have Islamist precursors. Thus, we need to shift from a focus simply upon those imminently planning acts of violence (terror) upon citizens to focusing upon those harboring the precursor ideology of non-violent Islamism. The axis of DHS security work should center on CVI (Countering Violent Islamism), not CVE.

This doesn’t mean that Muslim citizens should have their civil rights compromised. We should focus on Islamist public messaging and adherents. The monitoring of the readily available public footprint of non-violent Islamists should be a matter of routine surveillance. Authorities do not need warrants for this type of surveillance, and our agents should be using the Islamist nature of those posts to narrow down their threat risk.

Domestic Developments

Q: On your Twitter feed dated July 6, you remarked that Linda Sarsour, in a speech to ISNA (Islamic Society of North America) delivered over Independence Day weekend, called for a “jihad” against President Trump and praised Siraj Wahhaj, who in a conversation with you highlighted in your book called for the overthrow of the U.S. Constitution by the Qur’an. In that same speech, Sarsour also called for Muslims to refuse to assimilate into the United States. How should Muslim reformers and their non-Muslims allies best respond to her speech?

A: Sarsour’s jihadi comments and the flurry of public outrage may be the beginning of thought leaders in the West seeking out Muslim reformers as a response to the jihadism of Islamists like Sarsour. There will always be droves of useful idiots like Abigail Abrams at Time who hysterically try to apologize for the likes of Sarsour, who lead the radicalization of Muslims against America and secular liberal democracies.

But the jihadi Sarsours of the world will remain as “the” voice of Islam and Muslims if Muslim reformers are not given equal time on all forms of media to counter and marginalize her radicalization. As you point out, I have been exposing her mentor’s radicalism since I reported Siraj Wahhaj’s 1995 call for the overthrow of our U.S. Constitution at the same annual ISNA convention.

It’s time for Americans to connect the dots between ISIS operatives, Middle Eastern sharia states, and these American Islamist thought leaders. Only we reformers at the Muslim Reform Movement can begin the process of putting violent jihad and its global Islamist movement into the dustbin of history.

Sadly, Sarsour’s speech is one among thousands of speeches and sermons delivered every day by leading Islamists in the West. Only bigger platforms by Muslim reformers can counter that very real jihad. As I’ve said many times, the only jihad we need is a “jihad against jihad.”

Q: What is your opinion on the Trump administration’s travel ban against six Muslim-majority nations? Would you advise President Trump any differently on this in the wake of the recent terrorist in the United Kingdom?

A: The travel pause, not an actual ban, is a necessary initial tool for the commander-in-chief to reset the vetting mechanism of those seeking the privilege of entering our country. Yes, it’s true that most attacks on the homeland have been homegrown Islamist threats and not refugees. Yes, the nations with the greatest ideological threats like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar, and Pakistan were not included in the ban.

But that doesn’t invalidate the legitimacy of a pause on refugee immigration. The pause is simply the beginning of a shift toward a more rigorous form of vetting that I hope will include screening of Islamist ideologies.

Some studies report around 23 percent of those seeking refuge here have sympathies for ISIS. Those individuals have no right to come to the United States. Those who come to the United States should not do so solely out of humanitarian need, but also to share our values. Those with sympathies for Islamists (e.g., Muslim Brotherhood or ISIS) as well as those with sympathies for fascist dictatorships (e.g., Assadists or those with allegiances to the Russian government) should never be given the freedom to come to the U.S.

The nations included in the travel pause are at best not even allies and at worst our enemies and virtual anarchies on the verge of collapse. It makes perfect sense to identify anyone coming from those nations as needing extra vetting. There is nothing discriminatory against vetting people who happen to come from these specific countries, even if they are predominantly Muslim.

My advice to President Trump is that he assemble his campaign-promised “Commission on Radical Islamism” and have that commission become the focal point of our domestic and foreign policy shift away from CVE toward Countering Violent Islamism. It needs to have a heavy presence of reformist American Muslims in order to deflect commonplace attacks from Islamist identity groups that the commission would be “anti-Muslim.” There is nothing more pro-Muslim and pro-Islam than engaging Muslims and non-Muslims in a campaign to marginalize and defeat the Islamist theocrats in our communities.

Q: In our previous interview, you discussed the differences between Muslim reformers and Muslim Islamists. You recently called Daily Beast author Dean Obeidallah a “non-violent Islamist.” What do you mean by this?

A: Dean has been raising money for and defending Islamist groups like CAIR (Council on American Islamic Relations) and ISNA (Islamic Society of North America) for over a decade. Contrary to his useful idiots, he doesn’t have an excuse of being unaware of the realities of sharia supremacism taught and indoctrinated from the books and teachings of many if not most American and Western mosques.

He is a Muslim attorney who under the false and obnoxious cloak of comedy provides cover for droves of Islamists, and actively leads fundraisers for their movements in the West every month. He is particularly dangerous in that his comedic shtick and focus on grievances mainstreams his apologetics for Islamism and in fact starts many on the path of anti-American radicalization.

His Islamist bona fides are evidenced by his pathological silence when it comes to the identifying or acknowledging that the Islamist platform of ideas is always the precursor of militant Islamism. If the Ikhwan (Muslim Brotherhood) movement were not covert in the West, they would likely proudly award him one of their leading awards for defense and advocacy.

Q: What is your opinion about the recent protests against Sharia law in the United States? Do you think these protests are a legitimate form of criticism against Islamism, or do they express bigotry against Muslims?

A: When Muslims protested the sharia state of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt in 2013, that was not anti-Muslim bigotry. When the Green Revolution protested the Khomenist sharia state of Iran, that was not anti-Muslim, and when judges and lawyers in Pakistan protested the sharia state of Pakistan that was not anti-Muslim. Those are only a few examples. In fact, it is very pro-Muslim to reject theocratic Islamism and their instrument of their Islamist interpretations and institutionalization of sharia.

First, and foremost, every citizen should have a right to criticize any and all forms of sharia. That is part and parcel of genuine free speech. Anything short is the imposition of blasphemy laws. Many U.S. citizens are concerned when observing little to no condemnation from American Muslims as well as our anesthetized mainstream media of any of the draconian interpretations of sharia law which predominate the texts and teachings of most global Muslim institutions, including in the U.S.

My primary criticism of the rallies was simply that it just seemed a little odd that non-Muslims were rallying in cities across America, protesting to predominantly non-Muslim communities about the problems with the sharia law of Islamists. I would have rather seen their anti-sharia protests target the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and all of its attendant 56 Muslim majority nations who are the world’s primary cauldrons of Islamist sharia law. The protests should have begun in front of the Saudi, Turkish, Qatari, Egyptian, and Pakistani embassies in Washington, to name a few.

Without identifying the sharia institutions they were protesting, I could not see what the point of the rallies were. If it was simply to educate the American public that sharia is the primary instrument of Islamism, then what are the next steps? What is the cure to that diagnosis? Is their goal to engage reformist Muslims? These rallies didn’t even begin to accomplish that.

The Global Fight Against Islamism

Q: You recently criticized President Trump’s speech in Saudi Arabia to Muslim nations in May, where he called on these Muslim nations to “drive out the terrorists.” In this critique, you stated that this call was a “[g]reat sound bite,” but that “the hall should have then almost emptied except for Tunisia, Indonesia and a few others,” as “these tyrants [are] living off [of]…theocratic Islamist ideology that creates…global Islamist militants and their viral movements.”

A recent article in the Boston Globe reported that Saudi Arabia is instrumental in spreading Wahhabism beyond the Arab world to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bosnia, and Indonesia. How would you advise the Trump administration to act differently towards Saudi Arabia and our other Muslim allies?

A: This question is so important. We desperately need to distinguish our short-term military and diplomatic goals from our long-term goals in the region. Our short-term goals are obvious. First, we need to decimate ISIS and maintain a semblance of stability in the Middle East and North Africa.

Our long-term goals and policies should be to advocate for those who share our values and respect universal human rights. President Trump continued the old and tired policies of the U.S. shoring up our Sunni Arab ally axis to balance the region against the Shia axis of Iran, Iraq, and Syria bolstered by Russia. While this strategy would be fitting during the Cold War when we had a bigger global threat in the Soviets, the post-Arab Awakening landscape is quite different.

We need to acknowledge that shoring up so-called allies who don’t share our values contributes to those governments’ oppression of their own citizens, which is against our core values as Americans, and contributes to radicalizing those Muslims rather than liberating them from theocracy. These policies run counter to our global responsibility as the leaders of the free world and the ambassadors for all those who want to be free.

In the end, as messy as the route may be, America’s interest is to help those who want to be free achieve that God-given right. This process may be fraught with steps backward. But history has shown that eventually freedom will prevail. Anything short is to betray our own values and treat Muslim majority nations with a bigotry of low expectations.

Q: Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates have recently cut ties to Qatar because Qatar allegedly paid $1 billion ransom to Iran and an al-Qaeda affiliate to release kidnapped members of Qatar’s royal family. What are your thoughts on this?

A: I am no fan of the Saudi, Egyptian, or Emirati dictatorships. But in the global war against Islamism, most roads lead to Qatar first as the primary cancer of global Islamist movements and the Muslim Brotherhood’s networks. Their propaganda vis-à-vis Al Jazeera and other associated global Islamist media outlets and Qatari-purchased think tanks and universities have further operationalized and weaponized the Islamist movement.

There is little doubt that when it comes to the radicalization of Muslims globally through Brotherhood networks across the planet, Qatar is a leading antagonist and enemy of the free world. This began all the way back in 1961, when Qatar welcomed the leading radical Islamist icon and spiritual inspiration of the Muslim Brotherhood, Sheikh Yusuf Qaradawi, who escaped from Egypt. Qatar has never looked back since in their fealty for the Ikhwan.

The U.S. has facilitated this for generations thanks to Qatar’s domestic lobby influence and the U.S. military base in Qatar that has long been that lobby’s insurance policy. But the House of al-Thani overreached by seeking financial ties with and facilitation of Iran’s global Khomeinist networks. The Qatari royal family has even formed relationships with the Taliban and Al Qaeda. So we need to call this out, and isolate Qatar for its duplicity.

That being said, the Saudis are not innocent. Nor are their hands clean with regards to the cancer known as the Muslim Brotherhood. For over 50 years the Saudis have also financed and helped spread the establishment of Muslim Brotherhood legacy thinkers and groups in the West. The Wahhabis and the Ikhwan share both a hate of Western liberal democracies and a dream of wanting to establish Islamic states and the caliphate. Their essential difference lies in that Wahhabis are simply corporate, top-down, “elitist” Islamists, while the Brotherhood are grassroots, populist Islamists. Both their interpretations of Islam are supremacist and theocratic.

In the past few years things appear to be changing somewhat. The century-old Islamist Sunni battle between the Saudi Wahhabis and the Ikhwan is now becoming more globalized likely due to Saudi Arabia’s realized need to contain Qatar. At least in the short-term, the U.S. can leverage this to its advantage.

But in the long-term, we need to eventually stop policies of balancing tyrannies to establish an illusion of stability. We must isolate these entrenched tyrannies and cut off their lifelines to the world. There is no better place to start than Qatar and the Brotherhood network that it funds. However, I hope that this is the first phase of a longer process which will eventually lead to the isolation of Saudi Arabia and its global propagation of draconian Wahhabism.

Q: Recent reports have stated that days after the Trump administration criticized Qatar for funding terrorism, it authorized the sale of $12 billion in 36 F-15QA fighter jets to Qatar. What is your opinion on this?

A: This is hardly a way to “isolate” Qatar. It is time to end instances where the military (through bases, attachés, and congressionally approved arms sales), intelligence agents (CIA), State Department (diplomats), and the executive branch (president and U.N. ambassador) are all sending contradictory messages. Such contradictions give tyrants like the Al-Thani family of Qatar little motivation to ultimately change their behavior.

We should remember that the weapons which we sell them, with the intention of helping them maintain regional stability, are also used to shore up the government’s domestic iron fist against their own citizens. In the end, we need to follow this recalibration of messaging and policies towards Qatar with a similar one with other “allies” like Saudi Arabia and other tyrannies to whom we supply arms, and from whom we buy oil.

Q: The Islamic State recently claimed responsibility for two attacks on Iran. Is this a significant development to you?

A: This is a very significant development for a number of reasons. First, any operation inside Iran, let alone Tehran, is obviously not easy to execute for Arabic-speaking Sunni Islamists: so few if any have ever been reported despite ISIS’ deep animus with Shia Iran. Yet it appears that ISIS operatives were able to penetrate deep into the center of Farsi-speaking Tehran and target the symbolic sites of the parliament and the tomb of Ayatollah Khomeini, the symbol of the 1979 ascendancy of the Shia Khomeinist regime.

The primary nexus between Iran and ISIS are Iran’s Arab allies in Syria and Iraq. So it is very likely that this operation was planned long in advance and involved a deep infiltration of the Iranian forces with covert ISIS operatives. It is very likely that ISIS operatives exploited Iran’s alliances with Arab-speaking Shia Islamist Iraqis and Alawite Syrians.

While ISIS may be on the run militarily in their strongholds of northern Iraq and Raqqa, Syria, this operation should illustrate their ability to continue to launch sophisticated global operations. This sophistication is great marketing for ISIS as the primary brand of radical Sunni Islamism, which will in turn yield many more jihadis against Iran, Assad, Hezbollah, and the West.

Particularly telling is that Amaq (the ISIS news agency) immediately released a video of their operatives yelling in Arabic “We are not leaving; we will remain, God willing.” This was uploaded within minutes following the attacks in Tehran, and then released globally by ISIS. The phrase intentionally mimicked what ISIS spokesperson Mohammed Adnani said prior to his assassination in Syria.

The timing of this attack was likely in response to ISIS fearing a more unified West-Sunni front against them. ISIS likely wanted to deflect attention away from synergy between the West and Sunnis towards triggering a greater Sunni-Shia war. Exactly to this effect, Tehran immediately publicly blamed the attack on Riyadh, not ISIS.

Women’s March Treks 18 Miles To Protest National Rifle Association,"Several hundred demonstrators spent June 14 walking through heat and humidity to protest the National Rifle Association, gun violence, and racism. The Women’s March organized the 18-mile trek from the NRA headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia to the Department of Justice in downtown DC. Protestors spent the night in the city before returning to the Department of Justice the next morning to continue the rally.

The #NRA2DOJ march was sparked last month when Women’s March Inc. Co-President Tamika Mallory wrote an open letter in response to a viral NRA ad. The ad features NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch and denounces violence from the Left. Mallory called the video a “direct attack on people of color” and demanded the NRA take down the video, apologize, and issue a statement defending Philando Castile, a lawful gun owner shot by a Minnesota police man.

“It is clear that your organization does not value the legal rights nor the human rights of any of us,” the letter read. “Unless the NRA takes immediate action, the Women’s March will exercise our First Amendment right by calling for a mass mobilization.”

The NRA instead released a second video directly addressing Mallory. The march began at the NRA headquarters, where a counter-protest joined them. Along the route, protestors shouted chants like “Hands up, don’t shoot,” “This is what democracy looks like,” and “Hey hey, ho ho, the NRA has got to go.” Many in the crowd also showed support for Black Lives Matter.

“I would like them to eliminate assault weapons,” said one woman with the march. “I don’t think they need to go away completely, but they certainly need to be better regulated.”

An armed police escort traveled with the group. The protest marched past the White House, where they paused to shout “Shame! Shame!” One woman displayed her middle finger as she walked past. The group disbanded upon arrival at the Department of Justice, and some boarded a bus to the shared housing for the night.

When the protest returned Saturday morning, they met a small counter-protest carrying signs and a Gadsden flag.

“There’s been an attack on the freedom of speech,” said Dan Weber, who was part of the counter-protest. “There’s been an attack on our Second Amendment rights. And nationally, an attack on our Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights.”

Saturday’s rally at the Department of Justice opened with a song with the lyrics, “Went down to the White House to take back what they stole from me/and I took back my dignity/and I took back my humanity/and it’s under my feet.” Protestors also heard from a variety of activists, including leftist American Muslim Linda Sarsour and Mallory herself.

“You should be outraged that the NRA refuses to directly address the injustice in Philando Castile’s death,” shouted Women’s March Inc. Co-President Bob Bland, directing her speech toward the counter-protest across the street. “He was a licensed gun owner just like you.”",https://thefederalist.com/2017/07/18/womens-march-treks-18-miles-protest-national-rifle-association/,2017-07-18
Anti-Trumpers Need To Fire On The Real Enemy Instead Of Conservatives,"We hoped they would go away after the election. We hoped they would stop their whining and grandstanding once Donald Trump took office. We hoped they would accept defeat and embrace our Republican president, that they would hold him accountable regarding policy and support any effort to right the ship that has been lurching toward the brink for decades.

But they didn’t go away. Their whining has grown shrill. Their opposition, not only to Trump, but to anyone who breathes a word in his favor, has swelled like a blistering boil. Our hopes were in vain, and now we’re reaching a breaking point.

I’m not talking about the liberal “resistance.” They’ll never go away. The Left never stops. I’m talking about NeverTrumpers—or Anti-Trumpers, as many prefer to be called now. Their relentless attacks on Trump echo the Left. They whine about his tweets, “faux masculinity,” vulgarity, personnel changes, unproven “collusion” with the Russians. They call him a racist, white nationalist, dictator, traitor, and a lunatic.

These paragons of virtue are also attacking fellow conservatives who call out the hypocrisy of the media, focus on the good Trump is doing while calling him to account for the bad, and refuse to jump on the bandwagon of conspiracy theories or get upset over every annoying tweet. For this, they’re called sell-outs, racists, failed conservatives, Trump whores, Putin lovers, media organizations that have lost all credibility.

Whose Side Are You On?

Worse, Anti-Trumpers are colluding with Democrats to oppose the president and attacking fellow Republicans in Congress for trying to get conservative policies passed. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has teamed up with Democrat Sen. Cory Booker to write bipartisan legislation that stops Trump from firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol roundly criticized conservatives and the president during the Obamacare repeal process and is now engaged in talks to create a “Committee Not to Renominate the President.”

Ruling-class Republicans pulled out the knives on Sen. Mike Lee and his efforts at a full Obamacare repeal. His Senate colleague and fellow Republican Orrin Hatch, who blocked Lee’s moves toward actual repeal, accused him of being “against everything.” The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page piled on, labeling him an “Obamacare Republican.”

Anti-Trumpers are willing to throw conservatives under the bus to maintain the status quo, just as they’ve often done (remember the Tea Party). So much for principles. Never mind that conservatives fight for life, civil liberties, religious freedom, free speech, morality within the civil society, limited government, and strong national security—all of which are essential to conservatism.

Somehow this common ground they have with Anti-Trumpers goes out the window because they’re not firing up the stake and branding Trump evil incarnate. Instead, Anti-Trumpers side with those who oversee cultural decline, think girls can become boys, hate life, love centralized power and control, reject localism for globalism, play footsie with terrorists, and seek to silence free speech in every area of American society.

The GOP Enabled Big Government Long Before Trump

The problem with the Anti-Trumpers, however, is much larger—a point that’s captured by Sen. Jeff Flake’s transparent display of self-aggrandizement in publishing “Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle.” This pathetic work of hypocrisy is a shining example of everything that’s wrong with Anti-Trumpers.

“Never has a party so quickly or easily abandoned its core principles as my party did in the course of the 2016 campaign,” Flake writes. “And when you suddenly decide that you don’t believe what had recently been your most deeply held beliefs, then you open yourself to believing anything — or maybe nothing at all.”

What a joke. The GOP didn’t abandon its most deeply held beliefs in 2016. That’s been going on for decades. Where was Flake’s scorching pen during the reign of Barack Obama? Did any Republican senator or congressman write a manifesto about how Obama is ruining the country? No, of course not. Far be it from them to offend a Democrat. Instead, they—like Flake himself—propped up Obama’s leftist agenda by voting for policies and personnel that defy our deeply held beliefs.

Flake refused to join conservatives in their fight to defund Obamacare. He signed on to the Gang of Eight amnesty debacle. He confirmed one of the most dangerous attorney generals we’ve ever had—Loretta Lynch, justifying it in the name of “giving the president what he wants.” He has expanded centralized power by failing to cut spending while raising the debt ceiling. And he’s no friend to the Constitution with his support of gun control legislation.

Anti-Trumpers Accept the Left’s Premises

Hypocrisy, however, isn’t the real problem—and danger—of Anti-Trumpers. It’s their unwitting support of a leftist juggernaut that is bulldozing its way across our nation. Their unnecessary and childish attacks on conservatives who chose to vote for a Republican president rather than let a progressive criminal in the White House feeds the leftist beast. They’re writing themselves into a narrative that seeks to delegitimize conservatives, undermine their values of liberty, and eradicate their deeply held beliefs from a culture roiling in materialism, relativism, and subjectivism.

Is Trump the savior? No. Is Trump a conservative? No. But he’s not the threat these dictators of conscience think he is. Their histrionic reaction to his “populism” is rooted in prejudice, not insight. They resent that they’ve lost power, influence, and their own deluded sense of legitimacy. They don’t want to be associated with someone the Left labels a racist, and they want to run to the high ground instead of realizing that the fight is already underway—on the low road where leftists dwell.

It’s a fight that began years ago, but Republicans have been too ignorant and weak to truly engage. They haven’t even realized how the Left has been manipulating them, using them, and labeling them into irrelevancy—something I explained during the election, here and here.

This is the point Anti-Trumpers need to wrap their heads around. If they don’t, they’re going to end up giving the Left a hand in pushing us all over the cliff. Loudmouths like Flake and his conga line of preening purists need to wake up and see who the real enemy is.

Stabbing Your Own In the Back Is Imprudent

Anti-Trumpers are like the Night’s Watch who betrayed Jon Snow in “Game of Thrones.” They didn’t like how Snow joined forces with the wildlings beyond the wall (an enemy to the Night’s Watch and the people of Westeros) in order to defeat a greater enemy that threatened them all. Snow understood who the real enemy was—the cold totalitarians who make mindless drones of all they conquer. He was willing to work with people outside his own camp to defeat the greater threat. His brethren killed him for it.

The real enemy is the progressive Left and its cultural Marxism.

Those who repeatedly stabbed Snow under the sign of traitor thought they were noble, the only ones standing on principle, the righteous ones who wouldn’t betray their deeply held beliefs by aligning with an opposition group to defeat a greater threat. They considered it too risky, and they were so angered by Snow’s “betrayal” that they were willing to kill their own commander instead of taking the low road to defeat a common enemy. You see the irony. By attacking their own, they took the lowest road possible.

The Anti-Trumpers are no different. The real enemy is the progressive Left and its cultural Marxism. This is the enemy in our media, education system, scientific community, pop culture, entertainment, and politics. Its ideology is entrenched in our psychology. Trump’s “nationalism and populism” don’t hold a candle to this threat. Leftists are the White Walkers of the North with an ideology that doesn’t simply disagree with our deeply held beliefs on various points but wants to completely destroy them!

When Anti-Trumpers pile on about irrelevant issues (and there are many when it comes to criticisms of Trump), they are giving the Left legitimacy and delegitimizing those who are working to fight it.

When you say conservatives are discredited for writing pieces in support of Trump or critical of Anti-Trumpers or liberals, you’re strengthening the labeling that can lead to delegitimization. You’re joining the “in-group” of radical leftists and making a scapegoat of newly defined out-groups. You’re devaluing other conservatives and populists, who have legitimate gripes and agree with conservatives on many points. These people aren’t delegitimizing themselves by supporting Trump. Anti-Trumpers are doing it. They’re the ones guilty of promoting negative stereotypes and negative images that will weaken the very people fighting for this nation’s soul.

The Stakes Are Too High for Petty Infighting

Those who embrace a leftist ideology have been struggling and scheming for decades to transform our nation into their own vision of utopia. They’ve resorted to violence and destruction to achieve their twisted goals. They’re driven by a “better-world” ideal, enslaved to their own self-made worldly authorities who determine what is right, what is wrong, what words are acceptable, and what speech is allowed.

They see themselves as victims who have suffered in the past under the oppression of the brutal white male. They don’t seek healing; they seek retribution and dominance over people they perceive as dangerous because they’re looking at them through the lenses of the past. They no longer see fellow Americans as valued human beings—they see them as threats to their better-world dreams and to the unabated release of their self-destructive delusions on society.

This is the state of mind that plagues nearly half of our country, and Anti-Trumpers are feeding it by essentially agreeing that these liberal-defined out-groups (conservatives who support Trump, populists, anyone with a patriotic spirit or holders of traditional values) are a threat to a better-world ideology. Along with the Left, they’re creating the impression that we are a danger—a threat not only to America, but to the entire world. Yet they’re blind to the truth and fail to see the real danger to our nation.

Let’s Get Clear about the Real Enemy Here

Is it contradictory for me to assert the evils of labeling people while I’m doing the same? No, because there is right and wrong, evil and good, in this world. Some things are a true danger and should be called at for what they are—and defeated, not tolerated. Certainly, there are many shades of gray in the space between evil and good, but when it comes to totalitarian ideologies, we’re not dealing with shades of gray. We’re dealing with blackness.

What happens when a powerful in-group that holds to these evil beliefs becomes convinced that out-groups are a danger to their distorted ideology? What happens when you stop seeing people as fully integrated individuals and see them only as racists or lunatics or any other label that transforms a person from a human being into a monster? I’m not talking about general labels of distinctions about beliefs (liberals, conservatives, leftists, progressives, etc.). I’m talking about labels that carry stigma, that delegitimize and dehumanize.

The real danger is the ideology of leftism that is seeking to deconstruct our nation and destroy all who threaten its utopian ideals.

What happens is natural and logical—you want to destroy the danger, and that’s what Anti-Trumpers need to stop and consider. Really let that sink in. Trump supporters can be threatening and obnoxious, no doubt. There are many reasons for this, most of which are reactionary.

But they’re not the real threat. They’re not the ones physically attacking people in the streets. They’re not the ones who embody the elements of a genocidal mentality. They’re not the ones who embrace a philosophy that is, in essence, evil. The real danger is the ideology of leftism that is seeking to deconstruct our nation and destroy all who threaten its utopian ideals.

If Anti-Trumpers really care about our nation and not just the future of the party or their own political careers, then they will stop labeling fellow Republicans, stop demeaning them, stop attacking every little thing Trump does, and focus on what’s really important. They’ll oppose Trump when his policies don’t move our nation in the right direction, and they will wholeheartedly embrace him when they do. They’ll exercise some self-control and major on the majors instead of the minors.

They’ll stand up to Democrats before attacking fellow Republicans, and they’ll hold the media to account for spreading lies that support leftist ideology. They need to dig deep for the courage to risk their own reputations in the eyes of a culture that is blinded by leftist labels and fight the fight wherever it is—on the high road or the low.

Nixon’s Korea Dilemma Illuminates Why It’s Hard To Bomb Small Countries,"The current situation with North Korea is not the first time Americans have wrestled with the problem of nuclear conflict with small states. In 1969, Richard Nixon ordered options for nuclear targets against North Korea, and eventually abandoned his plan for punitive strikes. Little has changed in the nature of the dilemmas facing U.S. planners in North Korea and (should all else fail) Iran. Below is an excerpt from my 2014 book, “No Use,” in which I discussed the Nixon plan and the problem of American nuclear use against smaller powers.

I just don’t think nuclear weapons are usable . . . I’m not saying that we militarily disarm. I’m saying that I have nuclear weapons, and you’re North Korea and you have a nuclear weapon. You can use yours. I can’t use mine. What am I going to use it on? What are nuclear weapons good for? Busting cities. What President of the United States is going to take out Pyongyang?

—General Charles Horner, U.S. Air Force, 1994

The post-Cold War problem of rogue state nuclear proliferation is no longer hypothetical. These small powers, whom Clinton administration national security advisor Anthony Lake in 1994 termed “outlaw” or “backlash” states, not only remain “outside the family of nations,” in Lake’s words, but also “assault its basic values.”

North Korea’s nuclear tests and rash threats represent more than the entry of a new member into the nuclear club. Nuclear weapons are now in the hands of a small, unpredictable state whose foreign policy remains centered on hostility to the United States, whose arsenal is not dedicated to a specific opponent (as in the cases, for example, of India and Pakistan), whose regime remains in a state of declared hostilities with a U.S. ally, and whose leaders remain outside of any constraining alliance system. The North Korean regime has joined the nuclear game with no pretense to being a status-quo power, and no superpower competition to restrict its ambitions.

The North Korean challenge raises issues that go far beyond Pyongyang and Washington. Other states that are no friend to the liberal international order, particularly the terror-supporting theocracy in Iran, are seeking nuclear arms as well. How can small states, crowded by innocent neighbors and commanding only comparatively tiny arsenals, be deterred?

Nuclear Bombs Make Big Explosions

There are severe practical barriers to the use of nuclear weapons against these smaller powers, whether the aggressor is in East Asia, the Middle East or any other area where U.S. leaders will want to limit the impact of conducting what they will hope is a “small” nuclear war. Possible nuclear targets might be too close to a range of objects the United States and its allies may not wish to destroy, including natural or historical treasures. They will certainly be too close to millions of innocent human beings both in the targeted country and nearby.

This is the problem of “co-location,” the nesting of military or nuclear-related assets near civilian areas. Iran’s most important nuclear reactor, for example, is less than ten miles from the city of Bushehr and its 160,000 inhabitants; likewise, the Iranians have placed a uranium enrichment facility some 20 miles outside Qom, one of Iran’s treasured holy cities. North Korea’s Yongbyon nuclear facility is slightly more than 50 miles from Pyongyang, the capital city of more than three million that itself could be a target for retaliation.

Co-location is almost always a problem with strategic attacks, as experiences with the use of aerial bombing from World War II to Vietnam and the Gulf War have repeatedly shown. The dilemmas of targeting in small countries are especially aggravated by co-location issues because of the narrow geography of these states; military, civilian, and infrastructure assets are close to each other because literally everything is close to everything else.

An additional problem is that small nations are situated in crowded neighborhoods, and the effects of a nuclear exchange would be traumatic on nearby states. Not only can rogue regimes hold their own populations as human shields against nuclear attack, but they are also protected by the many innocent people who live near them—or more precisely, by the unwillingness of more civilized nations to kill or injure those innocent populations.

These geographic problems have already frustrated American planners in previous conflicts and crises. As U.S. Air Force General George Butler noted in 1999, “this lesson has been made time and again, in Korea, in Indochina and most recently in the Persian Gulf, [when] successive presidents of both parties have contemplated and then categorically rejected the employment of nuclear weapons even in the face of grave provocation.” Before the 1991 Gulf War, for example, the Americans were intentionally vague about what might happen should the Iraqis use chemical weapons against Allied troops, precisely because U.S. leaders did not want to get boxed in by their own threats.

President George H. W. Bush’s national security advisor, Brent Scowcroft, later recalled a January 1991 White House meeting: “If Iraq resorted to [chemical arms], we would say our reaction would depend on circumstances and that we would hold Iraqi divisional commanders responsible and bring them to justice for war crimes. No one advanced the notion of using nuclear weapons, and the President rejected it even in retaliation for chemical or biological attacks. We deliberately avoided spoken or unspoken threats to use them on the grounds that it is bad practice to threaten something you have no intention of carrying out” (emphasis added).

Too Many Disadvantages against North Korea

Long before Iraq and Iran, however, the United States was already wrestling with the problem of how to strike North Korea, where planning for the use of nuclear weapons repeatedly ran into various dead-ends. Declassified U.S. documents show that in 1969, for example, President Richard Nixon sought plans for dealing with North Korean military provocations, including an April 1969 North Korean attack that resulted in the downing of a U.S. reconnaissance plane. The Pentagon eventually provided Nixon with 25 alternatives, including an operation code-named FREEDOM DROP, the “pre-coordinated options for the selective use of tactical nuclear weapons against North Korea.”

There were three overlapping options in FREEDOM DROP. The first was a “punitive attack against up to 12 military targets with nuclear weapons of a yield of .2 to 10 kilotons.” (By comparison, the bomb dropped on Hiroshima was about 15 kilotons.) The next plan added an attack to neutralize North Korea’s air force (now obsolete, but then a major threat) by striking all 16 major North Korean military airfields with nuclear weapons in the 70-kiloton range. Finally, the third alternative was a broader attack with nuclear weapons ranging from 10 to 70 kilotons “aimed at diminishing greatly North Korea’s offensive capability” and included everything in the first two options plus 22 additional military targets.

In the end, Nixon and his advisors realized that nuclear force held no answers for dealing with Korea. The United States would have had to engage in wide strikes to suppress the North Korean military, which would have caused immense destruction and risked escalation to a wider war in the region.

In 1969, of course, the Cold War situation in East Asia was far more dangerous and complicated than it is today, with America’s Soviet and Chinese adversaries nearby (and already in an undeclared shooting war with each other along their common Asian border), and a much stronger North Korean force facing a weaker U.S. and South Korean defense. Still, U.S. presidents since Nixon have all faced the same problems when thinking about the use of nuclear weapons in North Korea.

The Potential Collateral Damage Is Huge

One option for retaliating against small states might be to engage in infrastructure targeting, in which the regime is destroyed with coordinated nuclear attacks on industry, energy, and other targets besides populations. Again, however, the problem is that small nations do not have significant strategic depth or wide expanses of territory, and there would be almost no way to establish practical differences between bombing only infrastructure and bombing everything else. From the Russian border to the 38th parallel, North Korea is less than 500 miles long, or about the distance from Boston to Washington DC. In places, it is narrower than 200 miles.

North Korea is less than 500 miles long, or about the distance from Boston to Washington DC.

Iran presents a similar problem, if on a slightly larger scale. The entire length of Iran is some 1,500 miles, and in overall territory it is roughly the size of Alaska. This might seem like a fairly vast space, but fewer than 740,000 people live in Alaska, while Iran has a population of 78 million, with more than a fifth of its people concentrated in its five largest cities and most of its military and nuclear facilities in or near those cities.

In the case of North Korea, there is an added problem: the DPRK is an impoverished country with very little infrastructure worth striking, or at least none that would require the use of nuclear weapons. In a tiny state, with an almost nonexistent economic infrastructure and most of its 22 million people already starving, even a small number of nuclear attacks could end up killing, in one way or another, almost the entire population.

American leaders have implied that they know and understand this problem, and that it might even enhance deterrence. The complete destruction of the North may have been what President Bill Clinton was implying in 1993 when he warned that if North Korea ever used a nuclear weapon, not only would the United States “quickly and overwhelmingly retaliate,” but that for the North Koreans it “would mean the end of their country as they know it.”

In 1994, Senator John McCain (later the 2008 Republican presidential nominee) was even clearer when he was asked about North Korean motives and whether Pyongyang’s usual threats were bluffs. “I don’t know,” McCain replied. “But I know what they understand and that is the threat of extinction.”

If You Break It, You Own It

Nuclear attacks on North Korea, Iran, or other small states may not result in complete extinction, but they will effectively destroy them as functioning nations, at which point victory will bring its own complications. The United States and its allies have always in previous wars assumed their proper responsibilities to their defeated enemies, including feeding and caring for the occupied population, reconstruction of the conquered territory, and reintegration of the defeated nation into the international system. (As Secretary of State Colin Powell warned before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, this is the rule that says: “If you break it, you own it.”) The aftermath of a nuclear attack, however, will overwhelm both the immediate palliative and long-term reconstructive capacities of the winner and the loser alike.

The sheer number of burn victims, to take but one example, will represent a disaster beyond any hope of remedy.

The sheer number of burn victims, to take but one example, will represent a disaster beyond any hope of remedy. The specialized facilities needed to treat burn victims are a rare resource across the world: the United States itself has only 2,000 of these so-called “burn beds” in the entire country. A nuclear attack of almost any size, even in relatively under-populated areas, will produce more burn injuries than any coalition of medical establishments can handle.

Policymakers, and especially the public, choose to ignore these kinds of consequences when speaking so casually and reflexively of nuclear retaliation. Neither the Americans nor anyone else will really want to care for thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of horribly injured people in the remains of a state that has already used nuclear weapons against the United States or its friends. But many of the sick, injured, and destitute will be civilians, and the victorious powers will have no choice but to render whatever assistance they can.

In reality, where burns and other severe injuries will be beyond medical help, U.S. and allied military forces advancing into the enemy damage zones in the aftermath of a nuclear counterattack will have no humane choice but to euthanize the untreatable casualties on the spot. Such actions could retroactively make America’s nuclear retaliation seem violent beyond reason, perhaps even genocidal, to friends and enemies alike.

Analysts at the RAND Corporation in 2010 modeled a single ten-kiloton explosion (again, smaller than Hiroshima) at ground level in Seoul. They estimated that some 160,000 people would die or suffer serious injuries for miles downwind from fallout alone. RAND also pointed out that this single nuclear strike in the South would “vastly outstrip medical supply” and “could cause panic,” problems that would be far worse should the United States engage in multiple strikes in North Korea, where modern medical care is unavailable.

One or several nuclear explosions in the Middle East will replicate these problems across several nations with common land borders. In the Iranian case, the political impact of long-term radiation will be fractured and multiplied across a matrix of various cultures, political systems, and religious movements. Even a small retaliatory strike will mean at least some radioactive contamination and consequent social and physical disruption throughout the Arab Middle East, and Islamic radicals would no doubt welcome the anger and suffering that would persist long after the war’s end. As a practical matter, aside from injury to innocent civilians, the destruction or contamination of crucial sea lanes, ports, and other assets could make the tangible costs of whatever started the war seem tiny by comparison.

And What If the Enemy Leaders Survive?

Moreover, there is no guarantee that such a strike would succeed, and the risk of failure raises yet another question about nuclear retaliation: what if the United States relies on small, tightly targeted nuclear weapons, and the enemy leadership survives the retaliatory strike anyway?

This is not a trivial possibility. As a 2010 RAND study pointed out, the late North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il had “a history of disappearing during high-end provocations, presumably so that he [could not] be targeted,” and his son and the rest of the Kim coterie doubtless will take similar precautions. Nuclear targeting is not a trial-and-error process: if the object is to kill or disable the enemy leadership with nuclear weapons, there will be no second chance if the attack fails. One nuclear salvo is going to be difficult enough to plan and execute, and a second will be impossible, politically if not militarily.

One nuclear salvo is going to be difficult enough to plan and execute, and a second will be impossible, politically if not militarily.

Should some member of the Kim family and the rest of North Korea’s high command emerge alive and defiant from the damage of a U.S. nuclear retaliatory strike, the United States will have taken its nuclear shot and missed, much like the conventional “shock and awe” operation that tried to kill Saddam Hussein—and didn’t—on the eve of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. A nuclear blow against the enemy leadership must not fail the first rule of regicide: if one is to strike the king, one must kill the king.

All of these challenges undermine the credibility of nuclear threats against small states, not because they cannot be answered, but because the answers are unacceptable and the West’s potential enemies surely know it. Some of these problems, such as a public panic about radiation, are unavoidable but might not present an ultimate barrier to the retaliatory use of nuclear weapons.

Other concerns are far more daunting, chief among them that breaching the nuclear barrier will require policymakers to believe that they have been given nearly perfect intelligence, that there will be no mistakes in translating that information into meaningful nuclear targeting, and that the strikes themselves will never suffer some kind of operational failure or error. Meanwhile, the terrible consequences of collateral damage to innocent civilians have no solution at all. These choices, risks, and eventual costs will all have to be made and accepted if nuclear weapons are used in a regional conflict.

War is more than a series of immediate technical or political problems. It involves the taking of human life on a national scale. In the case of nuclear war, it also includes the possible destruction of cities and regions that are part of the common heritage of mankind. When thinking about a major war between peers such as the former Soviet Union and the United States, the strategic risk and moral anguish of these questions were often set aside in the name of maintaining the balance of terror. When considering nuclear war with small states, where U.S. national existence is not at stake, such restrictions cannot be so easily dismissed.

"Without Evidence, CNN Claims Barcelona Attack Was Charlottesville 'Copycat'","At least 13 people were killed in Barcelona, Spain, today by terrorists who drove a car into a crowd at high speed. Two suspects have been arrested, but only one so far has been named, 28-year old Driss Oukabir, from Morocco. ISIS has since claimed responsibility for the attack.

CNN’s Wolf Blitzer suggested that the terrorists who carried out the attack were copycats of the violence in Charlottesville, where a woman was killed when a car driven by a white supremacist plowed into a crowd of protesters who were marching in opposition to white supremacist rally in the Virginia city.

“There will be questions about copycats, questions about if not what happened in Barcelona was at all, at all, a copycat version of what happened in Charlottesville, Virginia,” Blitzer said. “Even though they may be different characters and different political ambitions, they used the same killing device — a vehicle going at high speed — into a group, a large group, of pedestrians.”

CNN’s Chief National Security Correspondent Jim Sciutto suggested that ISIS, the terror group which has taken responsibility for the attack, was taking a page from the Charlottesville suspect’s playbook, a suggestion at odds with the fact that radical Islamic terrorists have used vehicles as weapons for years.

https://twitter.com/DanRiehl/status/898279769174929408

He later doubled down on the idea.

Twice.

I'm aware — Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) August 17, 2017

But it wasn’t just Blitzer and Sciutto desperately attempting to draw a straight line from Charlottesville to Barcelona. CNN’s Peter Bergen directly equated Islamic jihadists with “right-wing extremists.”

“This is the 14th vehicle attack, terrorist attack, we’ve seen in the west since 2014,” Bergen said. “Most of them have been jihadist terrorist attacks but obviously you had the Charlottesville attack by a right-wing extremist just in the past week.”

CNN seems to have forgotten all the times jihadists have used a car as a weapon to kill innocent people by plowing into groups of them.

In London, England, three terrorists killed five innocent people and injured 50 others by running people over on London Bridge and then proceeding to stab them in June.

In Nice, France, last July, 86 people were killed, and a total of 303 people were taken to the hospital when a jihadist drove a heavy truck into a crowd of people who were celebrating Bastille Day.

At Ohio State University, 11 students were injured when a radicalized Islamist student plowed his car into a group of students and then proceeded to stab them with a butcher knife.

In Jerusalem, Israel, four Israeli officer cadets were killed at 15 others wounded when a truck plowed into a crowd of soldiers.

In Berlin, Germany, 12 people were killed when jihadists driving a semi-truck plowed into a crowd at a Christmas market.

AsThe New York Times‘s Rukmini Callimachi notes, car ramming is ISIS’s calling card. Islamic terror groups have repeatedly called for jihadists to mow over crowds of people with cars, as that type of attack is easy to carry out and have done so for years.

Yes, both the Charlottesville suspect and ISIS terrorists have used cars to kill and terrorize, but pretending that jihadists, who have been weaponizing vehicles for quite some time, were retroactively inspired by the horror scene in Virginia last week is absurd.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/08/17/without-evidence-cnn-claims-barcelona-attack-was-a-charlottesville-copycat/,2017-08-17
"With Basilica Revealed As Target, Barcelona Attack Reverberates","The ISIS cell that launched coordinated attacks last week in Barcelona and the seaside town of Cambrils had something much bigger in mind than ramming vehicles into crowds of tourists. The latest reports indicate a group of 12 men had originally planned a series of coordinated explosions, including driving a van packed with explosives into the unfinished Sagrada Familia basilica. But when materials for the explosives accidentally detonated in a house on Wednesday night, the attackers, fearing their cell would be discovered, fell back on driving their vehicles into crowds.

Although observers in the West have celebrated ISIS’ territorial losses in Iraq and Syria as proof it is on the run, the attacks in Spain demonstrate the group’s adaptability and prove it is far from defeated.

What Happened in Barcelona Last Week

On Thursday, a man driving a van ploughed into a crowd of people in a popular tourist area of downtown Barcelona, killing 14 people and injuring more than 100. Hours later, the seaside town of Cambrils was hit with a second attack, leaving one dead and six wounded. The attackers’ vehicle, an Audi A3, overturned and five men emerged wielding knives and wearing fake suicide belts. The men were shot and killed by police. Several more men have been arrested and although police believe they’ve destroyed the terror cell, they are still looking for one of the men, Younes Abouyaaqoub, thought to be the driver.

The two attacks were straight from the ISIS handbook, literally. More than a year ago, the Islamic State issued a guide to would-be terrorists on how to implement a terror attack on a low budget and with minimal planning. One of those plans was to drive a vehicle, preferably a van, into a large crowd of people. The best place to find large crowds is a tourist hub. It also garners the most international attention, which is, of course part of their plan to maximize fear.

This tactic was used most devastatingly in the Bastille Day attacks in Nice last summer, which left 86 dead. Jihadists also used it to plow into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin in December and in two separate attacks in England this year.

Taking ISIS Terroritory Is a Temporary Setback

But unlike those attacks, which appear to have been carried out by individuals acting alone, the Spain attacks seem to be the work of an active terrorist cell. Most of the men involved were born in Morocco and lived in the town of Ripoll near the French border. The former imam from Ripoll is suspected of being involved in their radicalization.

With these attacks, the Islamic State has shown that it’s still very capable of inflicting enormous damage in Europe and, more importantly, that it does not require vast territorial holdings to inspire young Muslim men to do violence in the name of Islam.

What’s more, believers in fundamentalist Islam, who think that Islam is at war with the West—or with anyone outside the dar al-Islam—take a much longer view of history than we’re accustomed to. So ISIS lost most of its territorial holdings. That’s just one phase in a generations-long struggle. The war is far from over and plenty of Muslims, including those returning from fighting in Syria and Iraq as well as those who never had the opportunity to go, still want to fight the good fight against the infidels in Europe and beyond.

Spain Is a Recent Destination for Syrian Refugees

While it’s not surprising that ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack, it is surprising that this is the first Islamic State attack to occur in Spain since the group rose to international infamy in 2014. In fact, the last time Spain was the target of an Islamist-related terror attack was in 2004, when four coordinated bombings killed 191 people on trains in Madrid. That was the worst terror attack in Europe since the end of World War II. Since then, the country has been left untouched, until this week.

Other European countries have seen regular occurrences of small-scale ISIS-related terror attacks, like knifings or beheadings, even if those attacks ultimately do little damage. But not Spain, despite having an active Islamist community in Barcelona.

What’s equally notable is that, up until the last few months, Spain has not been hit as hard as other European countries by the migrant crisis. The number of migrants arriving in the country has been very low given the proximity between Spain and North Africa, as well as the historical connection between Spain and the Muslim world. Now, as Italy works to bring migration from Libya to a halt, migrants are seeking alternative routes and Spain is an obvious choice. According to the United Nations refugee agency, Spain lacks the resources to adequately handle the sudden influx of migrants and refugees.

Although Spain is probably not the final destination for migrants given the country’s chronic economic problems, it does represent a new target for ISIS. If the Spanish were ever going to welcome Muslim immigrants, attacks like these are likely to sour them on the topic.

Europe Will React, Also

It’s also likely to continue scaring European nations into restricting their borders as countries like Hungary and even France have already done in certain places. Abouyaaqoub, the remaining suspect in the Barcelona attack, is thought to have possibly slipped across the Spanish border into France. How long before border closures become permanent fixtures of the European landscape?

And what, exactly, will the European Union do about it? One can easily imagine the EU overstepping its bounds and attempting to sanction its core member states over migration and borders even as it largely ignored the broader problems the migrant crisis presented. Such a move would lead to a further rise in anti-EU sentiments and member states voting to leave the union if their citizens think their safety hangs in the balance.

Regardless, this attack is a reminder that ISIS and the religious ideology that motivates its followers will not simply vanish once the Islamic State is driven from its remaining strongholds in Syria and Iraq.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/08/21/sagrada-familia-basilica-revealed-target-barcelona-attack-reverberates/,2017-08-21
We Still Have Zero Evidence That Trump Colluded With Russia,"CNN counterterrorism analyst Phil Mudd, who worked for the FBI when now-special counsel Robert Mueller was the director, should have caused a bigger stir when he appeared to threaten President Trump: “Let me give you one bottom line as a former government official, the government is going to kill this guy.”

That’s because the president “defends Vladimir Putin,” Mudd said. After a few comments of agreement, CNN’s Jake Tapper made sure Mudd was speaking in a “metaphor.” “Obviously,” Mudd replied. “What I’m saying is government — people talk about the deep state — when you disrespect government officials who’ve done 30 years, they’re going to say, ‘Really’?”

The intelligence community seems to have it out for Donald Trump—but why? This CNN exchange was about Trump’s tongue-in-cheek response to Russia sending home U.S. embassy officials and spooks, Russia’s response to the latest bout of sanctions from Congress.

But the ire goes much deeper. Before the G20 summit, an NBC reporter asked Trump if he would definitively say that Russia interfered in the American election. Despite the U.S. intelligence community insisting otherwise, President Trump refused to place sole blame on Russia, adding that “nobody really knows for sure.”

In the beltway, this is unacceptable conspiracy-peddling that all but proves Trump-Russia collusion. After Trump’s G20 comments, MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough took time away from his budding music career to chide Trump on Facebook for “attacking US intelligence patriots.” Chuck Todd took to Twitter to call this yet another capitulation to Putin. These are but a few examples.

The problem with all this? Trump is 100 percent correct when he says, more or less, that although Russia would love to meddle in American elections, and probably did meddle to some extent, there is a troubling lack of proof that Russia was behind the release of Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails and files to WikiLeaks, or the phishing of John Podesta’s email.

This isn’t just about the legitimacy of Trump’s election, or whether he will be impeached. The degree to which Russia interfered in the election affects the pace of Trump’s policy agenda, our foreign policy, our defense budget, and even the chances of open war between the world’s two predominant nuclear powers. Getting to the truth of what happened in the 2016 election could even affect the future of the republic. Because of this, the unanswered questions surrounding Russia’s election interference should trouble every American.

Russian DNC and RNC Hacking in Late 2015

Start in 2015, when the Russian hacking began, before Trump was the Republican nominee. According to reports, a sole FBI agent contacted the DNC in September 2015 to notify them of hacking, possibly tied to Russia. The DNC claims that because their employee didn’t believe the caller was an FBI agent, the employee didn’t return the agent’s subsequent calls. At this point, hackers were also attempting to enter the RNC’s systems.

Around this time the DNC hired cybersecurity consultants from Good Harbor Security Risk Management, which provided a list of recommendations for improving DNC cybersecurity. The DNC failed to take action on any of the consultants’ recommendations. Further, although Russian hackers were allegedly already in the DNC network at the time, Good Harbor did not discover any hackers in its review.

In December 2015, the failure of an internal firewall at the DNC allowed Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign staffers to access team Clinton voter data. This led to a brawl that reached its zenith when team Bernie lost its access to the data, then retaliated by suing the DNC.

The DNC Announces Russia Hacked It

As a result, the DNC hired the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike in early 2016, which released their findings on the Bernie staffers’ misdeeds in April 2016, with no mention of any Russian intrusion. Only days later, however, CrowdStrike allegedly found evidence of Russian hackers in the DNC’s computers, after the hackers had accessed opposition research on then-candidate Trump. CrowdStrike and the DNC did not make public their claims of Russian hacking until mid-June of 2016.

Specifically, on June 12, 2016, WikiLeaks head Julian Assange announced that he had Hillary Clinton-related documents. On June 14, the DNC released news of the DNC’s hacking, blaming Russia. On June 15, anonymous hacker “Guccifer 2.0” claimed responsibility for the DNC hack and claimed to be the WikiLeaks source. Guccifer 2.0 started posting documents outside of WikiLeaks on June 15, 2016, and continued posting documents over the next couple months. WikiLeaks began publishing on July 22.

An important distinction must be made here. WikiLeaks posted information showing DNC staff were targeting Sanders to benefit Clinton’s campaign. This created a lot of friction, especially since the release occurred right before the Democrat National Convention. When you heard about materials gained from “Russian hacking” in the news, the materials came from WikiLeaks.

Guccifer 2.0’s releases, on the other hand, were in all likelihood a non-factor. They were also largely obtained from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), not the DNC. You likely did not hear about Guccifer 2.0’s files in the news.

A list of Guccifer’s materials include congressional passwords to news services, Lexis, and a federal courts public access system called PACER; a list of Democratic donors from 2005, files on a Democrat donor jailed in 2009, and files on a disgraced lobbyist’s donations to Republicans; opposition research on Sarah Palin and information that somewhat placed Barack Obama in a bad light; along with information on House races and candidates, almost all of it inconsequential. Guccifer also had a habit of lying, including that he or she had gained access to the Clinton Foundation donor list, when really the donors released were to the DCCC.

In other words, don’t conflate Guccifer 2.0 with WikiLeaks. Although it is possible that the two were affiliated entities in Russia’s election-interference campaign, the two groups released very different materials in consequence and scope. More on this later.

CrowdStrike and the DNC

Back at the DNC, between April, when the Russian hacking was allegedly discovered, and June, when news of the hacking went public, CrowdStrike proceeded to clean or replace all of the DNC servers. Because of this, direct confirmation of the DNC hack did not come from the FBI, but only from CrowdStrike.

According to former FBI Director James Comey, the FBI made “multiple requests at different levels” to examine the DNC servers, but the DNC refused. Ultimately, the FBI reached an agreement with the DNC that, in Comey’s words, a “highly respected private company” would report to the FBI what it found in the DNC servers.

CrowdStrike has also been wrong about Russian hacking in the past.

This is odd. Checking out the DNC servers, especially with an election and U.S. national security on the line, should be the FBI’s job. Next, CrowdStrike had incentives that might conflict with an honest assessment. Because CrowdStrike was being paid by the DNC, not taxpayers, it had a clear incentive to report whatever the DNC wanted it to report. The DNC had a political incentive to blame the hacking on Russia, which allowed the Clinton team to first falsely claim that the documents were heavily doctored or even wholly manufactured, then pivot to attacking Trump as a Putin stooge whenever WikiLeaks material came up.

Most important, CrowdStrike has a monetary incentive to find something big when skunking out hackers—the better to get its name in the public domain and go on to bigger and better contracts. In the words of Jeffrey Carr, a cybersecurity consultant who has lectured at the U.S. Army War College: “The only things that pay in the cybersecurity world are claims of attribution. Which foreign government attacked you? If you are critical of the attack, you make zero money. CrowdStrike is the poster child for companies that operate like this.”

Remember the Sony hack, supposedly perpetrated by North Korea? CrowdStrike was sure that North Korea was behind the hack, even though cybersecurity experts pointed out the evidence was thin and it was equally likely that the “hack” was the work of an insider.

CrowdStrike has also been wrong about Russian hacking in the past. Crowdstrike reported in December 2016 that the same malware used in the DNC attack had infected Ukrainian military Android devices and tracked and targeted Ukrainian artillery units. This allowed CrowdStrike to upgrade their assessment of the DNC hack to a “high degree of certainty.”

The only problem? No such “hacking” took place, and it could even be argued that by making the Ukrainian military doubt its equipment, the CrowdStrike report temporarily aided the Russian-backed rebels. CrowdStrike was roundly criticized by the Ukrainian government and cybersecurity experts as a result.

The Podesta Email Theft and Obama’s Response

After news of the DNC hacking, U.S. officials publicly expressed reticence to positively blame Russia for the DNC hacking, rightly not wanting to base U.S. national security assessments on the work of a private cybersecurity firm with ties to the Clinton campaign.

This changed in early August, when, according to the Washington Post, President Obama received a double-secret report from the CIA that Russia was indeed attempting to influence the election in favor of Trump. The NSA did not attach a high degree of confidence to the intelligence due to the nature of the source (likely an Eastern European intelligence agency), and the White House sat on the information. That changed on October 7, the very day WikiLeaks released the Podesta emails, when the Obama administration officially blamed Russia for both the DNC hack and the Podesta email theft.

There are several discrepancies to this tale. First, the Podesta email theft resulted from a ploy that tricked Podesta into giving the “hacker” his Gmail password. Phishing, the method used, isn’t hacking per se. It works by getting the victim to type his or her password into a “fake” website. Although Russian hacking groups have used the fake link trick before, saying that it can only be used by Russians is a stretch. In the words of Sam Biddle, “this isn’t a Russian technique any more than using a computer is a Russian technique.”

Although Russian hacking groups have used the fake link trick before, saying that it can only be used by Russians is a stretch.

It should also be questioned whether the Obama administration used the Podesta phishing to assess that Russia was behind the separate DNC hack, and why the Obama administration picked the very day of the Podesta email release to officially make its assessment.

Second, WikiLeaks’ Podesta email release occurred just hours after NBC released the infamous Trump-Billy Bush tape. Thus some say the Podesta emails were only released at this time to distract the hayseeds in flyover country from Trump’s vulgarity. Actually, everyone knew that WikiLeaks was set to release that day, and the NBC tape could have been shot to distract from the Podesta email trove.

Either way, the U.S. intelligence community never presented much proof, and even worse seemed to be working from the assessment of a private cybersecurity firm that had conveniently supplied the Clinton-campaign with much needed talking points for when the DNC or Podesta emails came up. During this time, former CIA director Michael Morell and former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden were calling Trump, in Morell’s words, “an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.”

The Forensic Evidence of Russian Hacking

After the election, the Obama administration prompted U.S. intelligence agencies to conduct a conclusive review of Russian meddling in the election. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released a report in December, and the director of national intelligence (DNI), which coordinates the appendages of the intelligence bureaucracy, released a report in January. These reports were supposed to contain definitive proof of Russian hacking.

Forensic evidence from CrowdStrike provided in the FBI and DHS report labeled the Russian cyber-campaign “Grizzly Steppe.” The Grizzly Steppe report, as proof of Russian interference, listed malware, called X-Agent, along with other “signatures,” such as hacking tools used to sort files.

One of the tools detected was attributed to the Russian government, but is commonly and widely used by hackers all over Russia and Ukraine.

CrowdStrike and the FBI reasoned that because X-Agent had been used to hack Germany’s Bundestag and a French TV network, then X-Agent must be tied to the Russian government. There are two obvious problems with this line of reasoning. First, we don’t know with certainty that the Russian government was behind the European hacks.

Second, in Carr’s words, “It is both foolish and baseless to claim, as CrowdStrike does, that X-Agent is used solely by the Russian government when the source code is there for anyone to find and use at will.”

This is true across the board. For example, one of the tools detected was attributed to the Russian government, but is commonly and widely used by hackers all over Russia and Ukraine. So little in the CrowdStrike forensics pointed to the Russian government with any modicum of certainty. Matt Taibbi at Rolling Stone called the report “long on jargon and short on specifics.”

Dan Goodin at Ars Technica summed up the report: “Instead of providing smoking guns that the Russian government was behind specific hacks, it largely restates previous private-sector claims without providing any support for their validity. Even worse, it provides an effective bait and switch by promising newly declassified intelligence into Russian hackers’ ‘tradecraft and techniques’ and instead delivering generic methods carried out by just about all state-sponsored hacking groups.”

As to the two pages that did cover the supposed Russian hack of the DNC, cybersecurity and intelligence experts widely held the report to be underwhelming at best.

Robert Lee, former Air Force cyberwarfare officer and cybersecurity fellow at New America, and Errata Security CEO Rob Graham believe the generous verdict is that the FBI and DHS left out more conclusive evidence. Lee believes the report was likely rushed. Graham concluded that the forensics “can be a reflection of the fact the government has excellent information for attribution. Or, it could be a reflection that they’ve got only weak bits and pieces. It’s impossible for us outsiders to tell.”

CrowdStrike’s weak forensic evidence even led to the somewhat-laughable caper where a Vermont utility found a code listed in the report on a laptop, which prompted the Washington Post to run a story about Russians hacking the electrical grid, with quotes from breathless Vermont Democrats decrying the Russian threat. In the end, it became apparent that the malware wasn’t associated with the Russians, that the laptop wasn’t connected to the grid, and that the illustrious Washington Post hadn’t bothered to contact the Vermont utility before publishing.

The DNI report, out in January 2017, was no better. While all except the NSA pinned the DNC and Podesta hacks on Russia with a high degree of confidence, the report forgot to include any new information. A third of the DNI report was devoted to decrying RT, the Russian-owned cable channel that nobody watches. The report went on to make the ludicrous claim that Russia peddled propaganda such as “Hillary’s no-fly zone risked starting a war with Russia,” when this was a legitimate concern many voters and members of Congress held, given a no-fly zone would require that American airpower shoot down Russian aircraft over Syria.

As to the two pages that did cover the supposed Russian hack of the DNC, cybersecurity and intelligence experts widely held the report to be underwhelming at best. Much of it was yet again a regurgitation of techy-sounding but generic terms.

Flynn, Comey, and Trump Collusion

Before the election, a separate but connected narrative began to emerge, also pushed if not originated by Clinton’s campaign: since Russia had interfered in the election, maybe Trump was more than just an unwitting stooge of the Kremlin. As proof of this was the story—now largely disproven despite resurrection attempts by the media—that a Russian bank was communicating with a server in Trump Tower. We also know that during this time the BuzzFeed Trump-Russia dossier had made its way to the FBI.

Grassley is wondering why the FBI paid the former British agent for garbage opposition research.

Ostensibly because of this, a shell-shocked post-election Obama administration moved to allow any “information” on Trump’s “possible collusion with Russia” to be disseminated widely down the daisy-chain of command in the federal intelligence bureaucracies. This enabled widespread leaking and is likely what snared Michael Flynn, when his non-nefarious intercepted communication with the Russian ambassador was illegally leaked, contradicting what he had told the vice president.

Since then have been three big developments. First, there was the unverified and error-ridden BuzzFeed dossier, compiled by a discredited former British agent and paid for by Fusion GPS, a firm with ties to the Kremlin and a history of smearing conservatives and opponents of Planned Parenthood. Fusion GPS also has ties to Natalia Veselnitskaya and Rinat Akhmetshin, the Russian lawyer and former Russian intelligence agent, respectively, who met with Donald Jr. under the guise of promising dirt on Clinton just days before the DNC made the theft of its files public.

Currently, Fusion GPS is stonewalling Chuck Grassley’s Senate investigators. Grassley is wondering why the FBI paid the former British agent, who went on to pay Russian agents, and in so doing entertained garbage opposition research partially written using the ol’ copy-paste trick from Google and Wikipedia.

This constant drip from anonymous intelligence officials has perpetuated the narrative that Russia not only hacked the election, but that President Trump also colluded with the Russians.

Second, there was the firing of James Comey, likely because Comey was not cooperating with Congress’ investigation into the illegal leaks by intelligence officials, and the Obama administration’s unmasking of Americans’ communications. It is also likely that Trump was upset after Comey seemed to tell Congress, under oath, that President Trump was under FBI investigation, when he had told Trump privately that he was not.

Third, there was the appointment of a special counsel, former FBI director and pal of James Comey Robert Mueller, who is tasked with investigating Trump’s ties with Russia. This was only made possible by Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ recusal from all matters related to Russia, after anonymous leaks brought into question how many times Sessions had met with the Russians during the 2016 campaign.

On top of this there is the constant drip of unverified and anonymous leaks to The New York Times and Washington Post. The leaks are themselves laughable. The best example is the “backchannel” story, if you’ve ever read a history book about the halcyon Cold War days. Thrown together, however, this constant drip from anonymous intelligence officials has perpetuated the narrative that Russia not only hacked the election, but that President Trump also colluded with the Russians.

VIPS and Guccifer 2.0

One last bombshell dropped several weeks ago, and was picked up by Bloomberg View’s Leonid Bershidsky and The Nation, a leftwing publication. A group of former U.S. intelligence officials, Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS), has been investigating the alleged Russian hacking of the DNC and related intelligence reports. Several VIPS members are “famous” for questioning the Bush administration’s Iraq weapons of mass destruction claims before the 2003 War in Iraq, and were quoted by The New York Times’ Nicholas Kristof.

Does this forensic evidence and the lack of forensic evidence from CrowdStrike warrant more investigation and explanation? Most definitely.

VIPS is around 30 members strong, some prominent and highly experienced former intelligence officials. It has been working with two outside sources. Remember Guccifer 2.0, and this hacker’s largely inconsequential files? Each source has managed to pull the metadata from the files, something akin to each file’s fingerprint.

The first source, the “Forensicator,” has found that on July 5, 2016, 1,976 megabytes of data were downloaded from the DNC’s server in 87 seconds, a rate of 22.7 megabytes per second. While it’s debatable, some say this speed is virtually impossible over the Internet, but it is definitely consistent with the transfer rate when downloading information to a USB thumb-drive. The Forensicator also found that time stamps in the metadata show that the download occurred at approximately 6:45 p.m. EST.

Adam Carter, the second source, found evidence in the metadata that the first five files Guccifer made public on June 15 had each been copied-and-pasted into a “Russianified [W]ord document with Russian language settings and style headings” to make it appear as if the Russian language was used in the hacking process. The traces of Russian found in the documents had been cited as the prime evidence that Guccifer 2.0 was a Russian hacking group. Carter is examining the July 5, 2016 documents to see if they were doctored in a similar fashion, but has yet to find anything.

Who are these sources? The Forensicator is someone in the Pacific Time Zone, and VIPS believes this person is “someone very good with the FBI,” given the level of expertise. Carter is located in the United Kingdom, and the pseudonym is play off a character from a BBC espionage show titled “Spooks.”

How far does VIPS go down the rabbit hole? VIPS believes the DNC experienced an internal theft then went to war, creating “Guccifer 2.0” to point to Russia whenever the stolen DNC files came up. Is this fanciful? Probably. Does this forensic evidence and the lack of forensic evidence from CrowdStrike warrant more investigation and explanation? Most definitely.

Beltway Republican Talking Points

All this brings us to today, where the latest development in the Trump-Russia story more or less says that President Obama knew about Russian hacking and didn’t do enough to stop it. It is now conventional wisdom within the Beltway that the Obama administration dropped the ball, and maybe even cost Clinton the election. Even Democrat Adam Schiff, Congress’ latest reincarnation of Joe McCarthy, was on a Sunday show saying that the Obama administration didn’t do enough to combat Russian interference in the election.

Meanwhile, there is an ongoing dispute between the DNC, its former chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and the DHS and FBI over how much assistance the DNC was offered during and after the alleged Russian hacking.

Most Republicans have used this as an opportunity to jump on a traditional Republican talking point: “The Democrats are weak on national security, which explains why Obama didn’t act.” Maybe true, but these developments also highlight a flaw in the “Russia hacked the election story.” If such an unprecedented attack was taking place, why wasn’t more done to stop it?

There is one potential answer we don’t hear much about: The Obama administration and the FBI didn’t take major action because Russian interference was not as clear-cut as it is being made to seem post-election. What if Russia’s election hacking and preference for Trump has been grossly exaggerated? What if the Russians could have been behind the hacks, but the only hard evidence is inconclusive?

More Evidence Before We Jump to Conclusions

Because of all the unanswered questions, most people known to the author here in flyover country—Republicans and Democrats alike—treat the intelligence community with a big healthy dose of skepticism. Too many in the Beltway fail to do the same. The GOP’s deference to intelligence agencies especially shows in the Senate, particularly the Senate Intelligence Committee. There is a reason Comey testified here, and not on Grassley’s Judiciary Committee.

Just for example, when Comey claimed during his hearings that CrowdStrike was such a high-class cybersecurity outfit that it didn’t matter that the FBI didn’t actually examine the DNC servers, there was no follow-up question.

Everybody knows what the NSA sucks up, and where the FBI spies, so there should be little problem with the government divulging any other forensic evidence found on the DNC’s computers.

Beltway types say more evidence is being withheld due to the fear of compromising “sources and methods.” But this isn’t the Cold War, where we risk exposing a human spy hiding in the Kremlin. Everybody knows what the NSA sucks up, and where the FBI spies, so there should be little problem with the government divulging any other forensic evidence found on the DNC’s computers, as has been done for previous hacking episodes perpetrated by state actors.

In the words of William Binney, a former NSA technical director and designer of many programs now in use, “Everything that they say must remain classified is already well-known; they’re playing the Wizard of Oz game.” Cybersecurity experts have mused that maybe Congress has been given more info, but members of Congress also seem left in the dark about CrowdStrike’s analysis, and clearly the president himself is ignorant of the undisclosed silver-bullet information that proves Russian interference.

Even the idea that Trump is better for Putin, so Putin wanted Trump elected, is laughable. If this is true, Putin is the real “useful idiot.” Putin’s lifeblood is oil and natural gas. We are to believe he just helped elect the most pro-energy U.S. president in decades, who plans on exporting oodles of cheap U.S. natural gas to U.S.-allied Europe?

Ditto for the revelation, first from the affably named Reality Winner, that Russian hackers got into state databases. Sure, Russia would do this, and probably did, but the only cybersecurity issue aired publicly after the election came from Georgia, Indiana, and Idaho election officials, who traced an attempted hack in their systems back to a computer at the Obama administration’s DHS (DHS has plausibly disputed at least the Georgia incident).

There’s obviously a good explanation for all of this, but given that there is a good explanation, why would state officials be complaining to the media about the DHS while they were under massive attack by Russian hackers? Wouldn’t state officials worry that they would end up looking stupid, or even losing their jobs? Is it possible that they were not properly informed by DHS, or that the hacking was less widespread than is currently being reported?

As for the reporting on state election infrastructure hacking, far too many breathless news outlets forgot to mention that little proof has been publicly provided for this episode of Russian hacking, either. It is all too likely that Russia really did hack state election databases (they certainly would like to), but, again, let’s hear the evidence before we pass sanctions that will harm our European allies, or start calling a U.S. presidential election illegitimate.

In all this, congressional Democrats, the beltway media, and too many Republican senators are woefully out of touch with the American people. It goes a long way to explain why President Trump won both the GOP nomination, and the general election. Worse, right on Russian hacking or not, is the degree to which the unelected U.S. intelligence community has been influencing policy decisions. Too many Republicans have been completely silent on this.

The American people in flyover country no longer trust any of these groups. If we can’t even trust the FBI to give an honest assessment of the Alexandria shooter’s motives, why should we trust everything the intelligence bureaucracies say if insufficient evidence is provided? What sounds like an oaf mouthing pro-Putin blather to some sounds like common sense in flyover country.

This is not the fault of flyover country. They have grown cynical for good reason. To win back its trust, start by providing more evidence to justify invalidating their political choices.

Berkeley’s Antifa Takeover Shows There Is Evil On Both Sides,"The media spent the last two weeks, after the deadly riot in Charlottesville, denouncing the notion that there were two sides responsible for the violence and specifically praising the far-left’s black-clad “Antifa” brawlers as freedom fighters who are saving us from Nazism. Then, on Sunday, Antifa was filmed attacking random people on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley, looking and acting exactly like a fascist militia bent on imposing rule by force.

This is a timely warning that the media is using the shock and horror of one evil, a newly brazen white nationalism, to panic us into submission to the horror of another evil. This media trope was established by criticism of President Trump for condemning violence on “both sides” in Charlottesville. Since anything Trump says must necessarily be wrong, it therefore became unacceptable for anyone to say that there was violence on both sides in Charlottesville.

But there was violence on both sides. That was clear from videos and photo essays and was described by reporters at the time. That even includes reporters who, in the process of factually describing the violence on both sides, still imposed the narrative that both sides weren’t to blame.

For example, New York Times reporter Sheryl Gay Stolberg acknowledged the “hatred” with which the black-clad Antifa attacked their opponents, but then the Twitter mob pressured her to recant. In the old days, we used to speculate that reporters and commentators tailored their views based on what they thought would get them invited to DC and New York cocktail parties. Now they tailor their views to avoid the amplified gossip of random people on a social media platform. Decide for yourself which is worse.

But the new edict had been delivered by the vox populi of political Twitter, and everyone fell in line. The Left has given up violence, having “cleansed itself through a painful process of introspection,” according to an opinion piece in the Washington Post. Even if they are violent, it’s just not the same thing, because they’re not motivated by “hate” when they club people over the head. They’re violent in a good way, and only against the bad guys. In fact, come to think of it, they’re just like the GIs who stormed Omaha Beach!

No, really, this actually became a meme, the most famous version of which came from The Atlantic‘s Jeffrey Goldberg.

Watching ‘Saving Private Ryan,’ a movie about a group of very aggressive alt-left protesters invading a beach without a permit. — Jeffrey Goldberg (@JeffreyGoldberg) August 16, 2017

Funny, I must have missed the part in “Saving Private Ryan” where Tom Hanks’s character is a radical socialist. Maybe it’s in the director’s cut.

After the media worked so hard to establish this new dogma, Antifa thugs repaid their courtesies by staging what can only be described as a violent takeover of the Berkeley campus. Ostensibly this was in response to a “No to Marxism in America” rally that never even happened. But it didn’t matter whether it happened Antifa used it as an excuse to attack any passersby suspected of being white nationalists or merely conservatives or Trump supporters.

Here was the scene.

The guy this mob is beating up isn’t a white nationalist or even a conservative, so far as anyone knows. He’s a cameraman covering the event—which I guess is where the press finally draws the line. Violence is bad, when it’s directed against them. The Antifa mob also assaulted and pepper-sprayed Patriot Prayer founder Joey Gibson, a moderate who advocates for “love, unity, and peace.”

Here’s another scene of Antifa attacking an “apparent alt-righter.”

Notice the black man rushing in to cover the body of the man being beaten on the ground, protecting him from Antifa—which undermines the whole narrative about how they’re protecting black people from racists.

Some of us have long warned that college campuses are becoming like one-party dictatorships, intolerant of any opinions or culture the Left oopposes. But up to now, this cloying monoculture has largely been accepted and enforced through voluntary means. They chose conformity. Now the universities are becoming literal pockets of totalitarian rule—zones in which those with dissenting political opinions face the prospect of being beaten by an angry mob.

Actually, it’s more anarchic than that. The Antifa mobs weren’t stopping people to interrogate them about their political opinions. In one video a middle-aged man and his college-aged son are being attacked, and he starts by asking, in a bewildered tone, “What are you guys beating us up for?” The only answer he gets is a fist in the face, and that’s the only answer any of us are liable to get when Antifa comes for us.

That’s what gives Antifa the genuine stamp of a totalitarian movement. They have gone from attacking “fascists” to attacking anyone who is not them, anyone who is not a member of the party.

Some in the media are starting to wake up. The same Washington Post that had recently explained to us how nonviolent the Left is suddenly is blaring unambiguous headlines like “Black-Clad Antifa Members Attack Peaceful Right-Wing Demonstrators in Berkeley.”

Vox took a peculiar middle path, declaring that beating up political opponents is bad, but not because it’s repellent in and of itself. It’s bad because it could lead to bad publicity: “such violence can reinforce right-wing views about the left.” Imagine that.

But others are digging deeper. A prominent leftist writer and television host who just goes by the name Touré is still hailing Antifa as heroes.

If white supremacists are American terrorists then those willing to physically fight them are doing heroic work. — Touré (@Toure) August 28, 2017

One of the mysteries of Antifa is that it’s hard to say exactly what their wider program is. They are communists, but in an old tradition of the anarchist left. In practice that means—well, it’s what you see in these videos. It’s what someone once called anarcho-totalitarianism. It is lust for power in its most elemental form: beating self-designated “enemies” as an end in itself, for the thrill of exercising physical power and coercion directly on the body of another person. It is how George Orwell described the steady state of the perfect totalitarian system: a boot stamping on a human face, forever.

Conventional liberals have toyed with a similar motive in a much more diluted and genteel form. They have indulged in the ritual of casting everyone who disagrees with them as a racist and fascist in order to establish their own sense of moral authority by comparison. What they haven’t figured out yet is that this seemingly benign thrill of self-congratulation is just a weaker form of the same impulse, a diluted form of the lust for power.

It starts with enjoying being part of a social-media mob that gets some guy fired from his job or forces some other guy into a groveling public apology in order to enjoy one’s own sense of power and authority as the imposer of these humiliations. But if you keep indulging this impulse, it ends with seeking the sense of control over others that comes from smashing your fist into someone’s face.

In case there’s any doubt as to where I stand—and if you’ve read beyond the headline of this article, you’re way ahead of everybody else on Twitter, so there’s some hope—I think that a variant of this same evil drives the white nationalists and neo-Nazis. The urge to denigrate people from other racial and ethnic backgrounds is a similar attempt to establish your own superiority by imposing humiliation on someone else—as well as a naked admission that you have no other way to demonstrate your personal merit.

The escalation of this urge to rule by force is revealed in all of the Nazi nostalgia, the theatricality of swastikas and torches. It’s all about pretending to be the tough guy who shows he’s superior to everyone else by bashing their skulls in—even if the current wannabes are starting out slowly by smacking people with sticks and running them down with cars.

But the riots in Berkeley should put to rest the idea that criticizing Antifa creates a false “moral equivalence” between the violent left and the violent right. It does create such an equivalence, but it’s not false. In the past century, that was established so thoroughly that it can be encapsulated in a single meme.

Historic axioms: 1. Nazis are bad.

2. Not everyone fighting Nazis is good. pic.twitter.com/v4rWtG7zKc — neontaster (@neontaster) August 16, 2017

For the benefit of college students, the guy in that photo is Joseph Stalin. He was the Communist dictator of the Soviet Union and a member of the violent “anti-fascist” left, and he imprisoned, tortured, and murdered at least as many innocent people as Hitler did.

To those on the moderate left, I know that you don’t want to give up on the dream of socialism. But how many times does that dream have to turn into a nightmare before you start to question it? The events of the past week—exaggerated praise and water-carrying for Antifa, followed by clear evidence that it really stands for terror and oppression—is a re-enactment in miniature of the cultural elite’s fascination with Communism during the twentieth century. Don’t be one of the bitter clingers who need to learn that lesson in much more horrifying form before you finally see the truth.

White nationalism and Antifa are both assaults on freedom and American values. They are both violent movements that ultimately seek rule by force as an end in itself. They are moral equivalents, and if we want to save our civilization, we have to stand firm—and stand together—against both illiberal sides.

Why We Shouldn’t Worry About Nuclear War With North Korea Right Now,"On September 3, at exactly noon local time, North Korea detonated its sixth nuclear device purportedly releasing 140 kilotons of TNT equivalent, according to a recent U.S. intelligence estimate, and almost ten times greater than the U.S. nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima in August 1945.

Shortly after the detonation, which triggered an artificial magnitude 6.3 earthquake, North Korea claimed that it successfully tested a thermonuclear bomb design that can be fitted on the Hwasong-14/KN20 intercontinental-range ballistic missile (ICBM), which was first tested on July 4 and is likely capable of reaching the continental United States.

While the test of a hydrogen bomb has been expected by North Korea analysts for some time, it has nonetheless triggered a nuclear war-scare in the United States fueled by the media and accentuated by repeated threats of the American president to preemptively strike North Korean missile sites.

However, while the situation remains tense and may of course escalate quickly, current events on the Korean Peninsula point more to Friedrich Nietzsche’s concept of the “eternal recurrence of the same thing” than Friedrich Hegel’s “slaughter benches of history.” In other words, despite North Korea’s burgeoning nuclear capabilities, there is no indication that the current situation is much different from past crises, all of which subsided without (much) bloodshed.

Deterrence Has Been Working

The reason we have not seen warfare on the Korean Peninsula in more than seven decades is because deterrence works, despite U.S. National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster’s recent assertion that “classical deterrence theory” does not apply to North Korea. South Korea (with the help of the United States) and North Korea can destroy one another. It is this mutual hostage situation that has kept the peace on the peninsula.

In fact, North Korea’s nuclear ballistic missile program—along with North Korean biological, chemical, and conventional warfare capabilities—is part of its deterrence strategy vis-à-vis South Korea and its allies. It is meant to deter a joint U.S.-South Korean attack on the North and prevent a toppling of the Kim Jong-Un regime. (Kim Jong-Un’s thinking is likely inspired by the fate of Muammar-al-Qaddafi and Saddam Hussein, who both gave up their nuclear weapons programs only to be overthrown and killed.)

In addition, shorter range nuclear-armed ballistic missiles and ICBMs are also useful for North Korea in the event of an actual war with South Korea and the United States. Carefully hidden short- and middle-range nuclear-armed ballistic missiles can slow down a joint U.S.-South Korean invasion force and attack South Korean, U.S., and Japanese military installations. ICBMs held in reserve and aimed at U.S. cities—should the United States not succeed destroying them at the outset of the war—can deter the United States from rushing in reinforcements and launch nuclear counterstrikes, as well prevent the allies from deposing the regime.

In turn, the United States has built up its deterrence strategy vis-à-vis North Korea by threatening massive retaliation in the event of a direct nuclear attack on the continental United States and South Korea, which would spell the end of the communist dictatorship. South Korea has also deployed precision-strike-capable missiles and special operations forces to be launched and dispatched against Kim Jong-un and the North’s military leadership in the event of a nuclear first strike or if there is an indication that an attack is imminent.

Deterrence Works If Everyone Doesn’t Want War

As I have argued in The Diplomat, for deterrence to work, South Korea, North Korea, and the United States need to share common assumptions about military and political realities on the Korean Peninsula, the most important of which is that war of any kind will be a catastrophe that would leave all three sides in a much worse position. Despite hyperbolic statements by the Trump White House and Pyongyang, this mutual assumption appears to still hold true, underwritten by repeated statements that the United States and North Korea would use nuclear weapons only in retaliation for a preemptive nuclear strike first carried out by the other side.

Mutual suspicions surrounding a sneak attack remain, of course. For example, North Korea has repeatedly condemned B-1B Lancer heavy strategic bomber patrols over and off the Korean Peninsula. Although the B-1B can no longer carry nuclear weapons, Pyongyang continues to see it as a nuclear-capable platform for launching a surprise nuclear attack. It remains also deeply suspicious of joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises, which it sees as precursors to an actual invasion of North Korea.

Nevertheless, military exercises and occasional flare-ups have been a regular occurrence over the past years and have become partly ritualized. One analyst went as far as to outline a basic plot of any North Korean crisis. The fact of the matter is that some analysts tend to focus too much on North Korean capabilities rather than the country’s likely intentions. A more capable and destructive missile arsenal does not automatically translate into a more aggressive foreign and defense policy. Furthermore, it does not negate the assumption that Kim Jong-Un is primarily driven by regime survival.

Threats Only Make the Situation Worse

Nonetheless, this does not imply that North Korea is not interested in weakening its adversaries in any way it can short of a military confrontation. For example, next to weapons of last resort, the North’s ICBMs are also useful in undermining military cooperation between the United States, South Korea, and Japan. The logic behind this is simple: The United States would probably not risk the destruction of one of its cities by a North Korean thermonuclear bomb in order to defend Seoul or Tokyo. Nuclear strategists refer to this as a “decoupling strategy”: the threat of nuclear attack decouples the United States from its allies in East Asia, although there is no hard evidence that this has indeed been a consideration of U.S. policy makers in the last months.

Unfortunately, however, the Trump administration has amplified the perception of a growing wedge between the United States and its East Asian allies in the last few weeks through various actions and statements. President Trump in essence recently called South Koreans appeasers and announced that the United States would withdraw from a bilateral, five-year-old free trade agreement. Moreover, President Trump’s threat of preventive war is putting pressure on South Korea and Japan to pursue independent military capabilities. This could trigger an accelerated regional arms race and further destabilize the region.

Still, there is no indication that the security situation on the Korean Peninsula has fundamentally changed with the successful test of an advanced nuclear device on September 3 and recent ballistic missile launches. Deterrence remains intact. North Korea has had the capability to inflict severe damage on South Korean and Japanese cities for years, but has not done so because it assumes that it would threaten the survival of the regime. Indeed, supposing that Kim is no madman, his primary intention behind recent tests is to strengthen deterrence and prevent rather than initiate war.

What next steps should the United States then take?

First, given that deterrence continues to work, U.S. talk of preemptive war against North Korea is counterproductive and needs to stop. Second, the United States, in close consultations with its regional allies, needs to continue to reach out to North Korea and leave all diplomatic options open. Third, as one former U.S. diplomat emphasizes, the short-term objective of U.S. diplomacy should be a slowing down or even freeze of the North Korean nuclear weapons and missile programs rather than an unrealistic push for complete denuclearization. Fourth, the United States and North Korea need to agree on concrete steps (e.g. military-to-military talks) to deescalate tensions in the long-run.

Last and most important, the U.S. government needs to speak with one voice on North Korea lest it risk misinterpretation of its moves by all sides with possibly disastrous consequences, not just for the Korean Peninsula but for all of East Asia.

New Florida Law Aims To Protect Religious Expression In Public Schools,"Christianity, part of America’s national heritage, is increasingly contended in public education. Broad arguments have succeeded in wiping out Christian prayers and a decades-old historical pledge in courts across the country. But new legislation in Florida aims to ensure that students may practice Christianity, and any religion, freely this school year and beyond.

A Series of Public School Attacks

What began as isolated incidences in the Sunshine State grew into a string of anti-Christian attacks against students in recent years. A math teacher in Hillsborough County, Florida, a proponent of the LGBT agenda and a lesbian, told a student she couldn’t wear a cross in her classroom because the cross represents a gang symbol, said Anthony Verdugo, founder and executive director of Christian Family Coalition Florida.

“Three years ago, a student named Giovanni Rubeo, an elementary school student at Park Lakes Elementary School in Lauderdale Lakes, was reprimanded by a teacher, taken to the principal’s office and had his parents pulled from work, all for reading a Bible during his free reading time in school,” Verdugo said. “Obviously this teacher felt that her rules overrode the First Amendment.”

There are also cases against prayer in public school in Florida, Verdugo said.

“Through these cases and others, we established there was a need in Florida for the Florida Student and School Personnel Religious Liberties Act to remedy these cases of discrimination,” Verdugo said.

Anti-Religious School Policies On the Rise

“As a school board member, I can tell you that it was much needed clarifying guidance for local policy makers,” said Shawn Frost, Florida Coalition of School Board Members president. “As a conservative, I can tell you that the bias toward secular humanism in our schools is a daily assault on the deeply held religious values of families by administrators that needed to be put in check. The prevailing philosophy is that schools should offer freedom from religion, even when practiced by fellow students.”

“From my perspective, there is a very anti-Christian sentiment in many of our public schools,” said Daniel Diaz. “Teachers are afraid to mention anything related to their faith, so much so that their fear and caution gets passed on to the students as if the students were an extension of the state, because they attend a publicly-funded school. Also, because of the political correctness and sue-happy culture we live in, school districts are doing everything they can to prevent potential lawsuits by passing anti-religious expression policies that limit the students from doing things as simple as reading their bibles during free time, or drawing pictures of biblical figures which they consider heroes.”

“We’ve seen the censorship of speeches of valedictorians and graduation exercises,” said Sen. Dennis Baxley (R-District 12). “We’ve had school personnel told they couldn’t have a Bible on their desk. I think that’s too tight.”

Seeking A Legislative Response to National Trends

Several states have passed or considered the “Religious Viewpoints Anti-Discrimination Act,” now law in Texas, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee. Religious liberty laws are considered strongholds against a trending decrease in religious freedoms in public education.

Passed and signed into law by Gov. Rick Scott (R) in June and effective July 1, the Florida Act states, “A school district may not discriminate against a student, parent, or school personnel on the basis of a religious viewpoint or religious expression…”

“When we prepared to endorse this religious freedom proposal, we studied the issue, one of the things we found was a profound need for religious liberty protections in the state of Florida,” Verdugo said. “We are at the epicenter of the fight for religious liberty in America.”

State Representatives Kimberly Daniels (D-Jacksonville) and Patricia Williams (D-Broward) sponsored House Bill 303, with strong backing from the Christian Family Coalition Florida; Baxley sponsored the companion bill, SB 436, in the Senate.

“We had a number of cases where it has become clear that how religious expression is to be applied in the school environment needs some clarity,” Baxley said. “Expressed by people in the school settings, there has been a chilling effect. Most people feel as though they are not supposed to say anything about their faith or speak in a faith context. I have a strong feeling that the First Amendment allows religious expression and does not stop at a school boundary and I would hope that it would in fact allow for an open exchange of ideas in an education setting. Our students, administrators, educators, parents, deserve some clarity.”

Opposing Religious Freedom In Schools

The CFC recruited speakers, testified before all committees of referral, prepared scripts, submitted testimony, lobbied elected officials, and deployed action alerts in support of the Act. Opponents included administrators and educators across the state, the Anti-Defamation League, Equality Florida, and Secular Humanists.

The first Senate hearing yielded the most challenges.

“We testified at all the committee hearings, there were five of them,” Verdugo said. “At these hearings, the hate, bigotry, intolerance and discrimination were on full display by our opponents as well as from Democratic legislators spewing out twisted logic. You can disagree without being disagreeable, but these are people who were completely ignorant about the issue they were being asked to vote on in their respective committees.”

“Their arguments were that the First Amendment already protected religious expression on campus, and that it would alienate those students in school who were not religious, and who might offend those students that might feel left out when other students pray or express their religious expressions,” Diaz said.

Baxley said he viewed the legislation “as an enabling bill that describes how religious liberty would be viewed on the ground.” The House version was amended during the session, resulting in what Baxley described as a “watered down” version of the bill, one that would not require the Department of Education to create a model policy. But legislators held firm on the original bill language and prevailed, passing with bipartisan support.

“The bill was passed through great courage and tenacity by all,” Verdugo said. “We’re very proud of it.”

Baxley believes most people recognize that those who oppose faith expression in schools have gone too far, and have created “a chilling effect” on students. “I have young people tell me they feel inhibited and that you can’t say Jesus out loud unless you’re cursing,” he said. “My view is that the First Amendment doesn’t protect foul speech, but positive and encouraging speech and for most of us that is what informs our conscience and our sense of right and wrong. I don’t think we want that chilling effect on that expression and I don’t think the constitutional framers wanted it either.”

Legislation With Conviction

“I have a conviction that we spend an awful lot of time teaching the students the how of life and I see a void when it comes to the why of life,” Baxley said. “Faith expressions give us the why of life and what is transpiring is we’re violating that [liberty] and replacing it with secular humanism.”

He added, “There’s always going to be some value system of how we apply knowledge and I think school administrators certainly have due authority over keeping order and minimizing disruptions and I certainly trust them to apply that responsibility in this atmosphere at the same time.”

But Baxley believes faith practices shouldn’t interfere with the educational process, they should enhance it: “I have great empathy for our educators and administrators for managing an environment that can be difficult, but our priority in America should be keeping that liberty alive,” he said. “I had a question on the Senate floor of whether this would open the door for some hate, and I said no—it might actually foster some love.”

This Battle Is Far From Over

Florida legislators passed landmark legislation in protecting religious expression in the state’s public schools. But supporters know the matter is far from closed.

“Different viewpoints will be challenged in court,” Baxley said. “Hopefully reason will prevail and we don’t have too much legislating from the bench and they’ll understand the legislature has the responsibility to provide this clarity. … Value issues don’t take a lot of time but they do take courage because you will have vociferous critics. But I don’t mind having the debate and getting on the floor and being able to explain our understanding of this constitutional freedom is valuable time.”

“Anti-Christian extremists are always looking to undermine our rights so I wouldn’t be surprised if we have to go back to the courts but first, we have to make sure that Florida school boards adopt the FSASPRLA and pursue [that] to make sure Florida counties don’t try to undermine the new law,” Verdugo said.

“Historically liberals were about everyone having a right to speak, but now we’re seeing traditional values getting the hush,”Baxley noted. “… We need diversity of thought, not just different cultures and nationalities and races. America’s a fascinating place where everyone can come together and experience this diversity. We can do it respectfully.

Why Trump's Attacks On The Media Are Not Even Close To Hitlerian,"The public sphere is broken. Journalists and public intellectuals persistently read evidence in the darkest possible light and exclude evidence that would put events in their ordinary, less catastrophic context. It’s one of those moments when all bad things are Adolph Hitler, burying worthwhile criticism of power in a blizzard of dumb hyperbole.

Take the president’s criticism of the press, for example, and catastrophize it to meet the current climate of public discussion. Chillingly, Donald Trump tweets stuff about reporters, and makes fun of them from the dais. Nothing like this has ever happened before in the United States, where no previous elected official has ever criticized any journalists.

As the Associated Press put it, after the newly inaugurated President Trump held an apparently terrifying press conference:

Never before has a president stood in the White House and so publicly maligned the press or attacked reporters by name, according to presidential historians. Not even Richard Nixon in the days of Watergate. ‘It was bizarre theater,’ said Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University. ‘He turned a presidential press conference into a reality TV show in which he can be the star and browbeat anyone who objects to him with the power of his office.’

Some especially dull-minded politicians have taken this idea to its dumbest extremes, as when the California congressman John Garamendi bluntly said in a CNN interview that Trump has “engaged in rhetoric that slams the press which, by the way, happens to be the very first thing that a dictator will do to secure his position…If one were to look at Nazi Germany, that was the very early part of their tenure was to delegitimize the press.”

Yale University history professor Timothy Snyder, a particularly rabid TrumpHitler caterwauler, has made similar claims—saying, in response to an interviewer’s question about Trump’s criticism of reporters, “of course, it’s an atrocity, and it’s a violation of basic American traditions, to attack journalists like that.”

It’s not. Since (at least) the inception of the American republic, attacks on journalists in the United States have been frequent and furious. Journalists and writers have been killed, threatened with death, beaten, driven out of towns and regions, prosecuted, imprisoned, and forced to watch as their offices were destroyed and their printing presses thrown in the river. There’s a dark and painful history to refer to, and it’s a history other than Hitler, rooted in American soil. We’re in a far less menacing American historical moment than many American journalists have seen in the past. Jim Acosta is not a new and special kind of victim, bless his heart.

Consider What President John Adams Did

Compare the “bizarre theater” of President Trump browbeating journalists in a press conference to the way President John Adams treated Thomas Cooper. The editor of a Pennsylvania newspaper, Cooper wrote and published an essay in 1799 calling Adams a “power-mad despot.” The president told Secretary of State Timothy Pickering that Cooper “ought to be prosecuted.”

And he was, after he published another attack on Adams. Brought to trial in April 1800, Cooper was convicted on a charge of violating the federal Sedition Act, and sentenced to both six months in prison and a $400 fine—at a moment when a pound of butter cost a few cents, and a sergeant in the Marine Corps was paid six dollars a month.

Cooper was one of several newspaper editors the Federalists prosecuted in the last years of the Adams administration. Another, Matthew Lyon, was both an editor and a member of Congress. He spent four months in prison for criticizing the president.

They had it easy. Consider the example of the abolitionist newspaper editor Elijah P. Lovejoy, who wrote and printed anti-slavery pieces in pro-slavery Missouri in the 1830s. In 1837, Lovejoy called, in print, for immediate, universal emancipation. After mobs destroyed his printing press—several times—Lovejoy fled across the river to Illinois, a free state. That’s where he was shot and killed the next time a mob came to destroy his printing press.

American reporters could even be dragged into the jurisdiction of military justice, tried like soldiers or enemy spies by a system with limited procedural protections. This is exactly what happened to Thomas Knox, a reporter for the New York Herald during the Civil War. Maneuvering against Vicksburg, Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman issued orders forbidding journalists to accompany his troops or report on their actions. When Knox ignored the order, Sherman convened a court-martial to try Knox as a spy—an American journalist, tried by a military court for reporting on the American military.

How does this compare to critical tweeting, for crying out loud? In 2017, which journalists are standing before military tribunals?

Governments Manipulated Journalism Outright

While individual American journalists have often been targeted by their government or countrymen, journalism as a whole has sometimes been brought under suspicion and a strong implication of state control. During World War I, President Woodrow Wilson empowered a Progressive journalist, George Creel, to run a federal committee tasked with managing wartime public discourse.

While the Committee on Public Information (CPI) didn’t take direct control of the press, the committee did produce pro-war content for American newspapers, and American newspapers cheerfully printed what they were given. As one newspaper editor put it, Creel and his committee “conscripted public opinion.” Flooding the public sphere, the Creel committee also produced its own propaganda movies, with nuanced titles like “The Kaiser: The Beast of Berlin.”

Producing pro-war material for public consumption, the Wilson administration and its wrongthink committee also policed public speech, encouraging ordinary Americans to report disloyal statements to prosecutors in the federal Department of Justice. As the legal scholar Geoffrey Stone writes, “The results were staggering. Each day, thousands of accusations of disloyalty flooded into the department. Adding to the frenzy, the CPI encouraged citizens to form voluntary associations dedicated to informing the authorities of possible disloyalty.”

The most frequent, banal, and misguided attack on free speech in America today is the one that takes recourse to Oliver Wendell Holmes’s statement about crying fire in a crowded theater. (Or, if you prefer, crying wolf in a crowded theater.)

But the people resorting to that argument rarely bother to notice the case it comes from: Schenck v. United States, an appeal to the Supreme Court that followed the conviction of an officer of the Socialist Party of America. Charles Schenck’s crime was that he published sedition: a carefully worded pamphlet that “exhorted readers to sign a petition calling for repeal of the draft.” The Supreme Court upheld that conviction. In Progressive-era America, publishing a political argument could be a crime.

Progressive-era speech policing: more aggressive than some critical tweets, or less aggressive?

Reporters Are Fair Game For Criticism

Twenty-five years later, a prominent isolationalist, Willian Dudley Pelley, wrote a series of essays for his own magazine, the Galilean, criticizing the American entry into World War II. Pelley was an inveterate scumbag, the author of a song that began, “O haven’t you heard the news? We’re at war to save the Jews.” But he was also just a writer and a publisher, charged under the Espionage Act for making false statements that helped America’s military enemies. He was convicted—for writing and publishing—and spent ten years in a federal prison. But thank goodness he didn’t face the menace of Twitter, because Franklin Roosevelt might have really oppressed him with a mean tweet.

In the interview I quoted above, Yale’s Snyder went farther than his claim that criticism of the press is “a violation of basic American traditions.” In fact, he insisted that Trump’s Twitter and press conference criticisms reflect the same strategy pursued by Hitler and Vladimir Lenin (et al.), “because what we know about 20th century regime changes are that they involve, at their base, an assault on everyday factuality. Whether it’s the extreme-right fascist idea that facts aren’t important, only a sense of collectivity, of belonging to the nation, this organic group, is important, or whether it’s the extreme-left Bolshevik idea that the facts of today have to be sacrificed in the name of a vision tomorrow, we know that these forms of radical politics have to begin with undermining a sense of everyday factuality.”

But the criticism of a journalist isn’t inherently an attack on “a sense of everyday factuality,” or it would be just like Hitler to question the work of Stephen Glass or Jayson Blair. Reporters are people. Like politicians, they can be criticized. There’s nothing remotely fascist about criticizing them. In an open society, everyone can be criticized, and everyone can criticize.

We can fall a long, dark way into the reality of the American past without reaching fascism. There’s a middle ground between complete freedom of expression and the pathetic recourse to OMG HITLER. Reporters can take criticism from government officials without “an assault on everyday factuality” destroying our ability to see any form of truth. A president making fun of a journalist from the dais isn’t like a gulag, and it isn’t like a death camp. Only a fool pushes through this enormous and obvious middle ground like it isn’t there.

At the moment, though, we have plenty of fools to go around. The costs to public debate are high, and they should stop.

Rep. Steve Scalise Returns To Congress After Attack: 'Miracles Happen',"Rep. Steve Scalise made his comeback to the U.S. House of Representatives Thursday. He entered the chamber to a standing ovation from colleagues, using two canes and wearing royal blue tennis shoes with his suit. There was a giant smile on his face as the Louisiana Republican’s friends descended for hugs and high fives and he took his place to speak.

Scalise has been recovering from a gunshot wound since June, and this was his first appearance back at work. The House majority whip was seriously injured in a June 14 attack on a group of Republicans by James Hodgkinson, an Illinois man who opened fire after asking fellow congressmen their party identification as they practiced for the congressional baseball game in Alexandria, Va. Hodgkinson was killed by Capitol Police, who were there as part of the whip’s security detail.

“You have no idea how great this feels to be back here at work in the people’s House,” Scalise said after House Speaker Paul Ryan recognized him with a joking nod to House rules: “For what purpose does the gentleman from Louisiana seek recognition?” Ryan asked. “The gentleman is recognized for as much time as he may consume.”

Scalise referenced briefly that the last three months had been tough for his family, but quickly turned to gratitude.

“If you look at the outpouring of love of warmth of prayer,” he said, “It has given us the strength to get through all this and get to this point today. And it starts with God.”

Scalise told the story of the moment he was shot.

“The first thing I did once I was done and I couldn’t move is I prayed. It gave me an unbelievable sense of calm,” he said. “I prayed for very specific things. Pretty much every one of those prayers was answered and they were some pretty challenging prayers I was putting in God’s hands. It just gives you renewed faith and understanding that the power of prayer is just something you can’t underestimate.”

Scalise spoke for 15 minutes, thanking his colleagues and his Capitol Police protection. He was stabilized on the baseball field by fellow Rep. Brad Wenstrom, an Iraq veteran. Capitol Police officers David Bailey and Crystal Griner risked their lives protecting the congressmen as they took down the shooter. Griner was shot and unable to attend Scalise’s speech, but Bailey was on hand and also got a standing ovation.

“David, you are my hero. You saved my life,” Scalise said.

Scalise thanked his medical team and his wife, Jennifer, for their support in the months of recovery. He was in the hospital for six weeks after being struck by one bullet in the left hip. The bullet traveled through the pelvic area, causing internal bleeding, and Scalise underwent several surgeries.

“Several of them, my life was very much in the balance,” he said. “[My medical team] gave me a second chance at life.”

Since then, Scalise has been in intense rehabilitation, relearning to walk.

Scalise mentioned that world leaders, such as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and British Prime Minister Theresa May and Jordan’s King Abdullah, had reached out to him in addition to other leaders he’d never met before.

“What it says is, sure they cared about my wellbeing, but more than that, they saw this as an attack on all of us,” Scalise said. “They saw this as an attack on the institution of our Congress and our government.”

Other world leaders ""cared about my well-being, but more than that, they saw this as an attack on all of us,"" Scalise says pic.twitter.com/6eheuuqpom — CBS News (@CBSNews) September 28, 2017

“Our prayers have been answered” said Ryan, introducing Scalise. “What an inspiration you have been to this House and the people it serves. America is grateful for this moment.”

Scalise closed by saying the shooting, which he referred to as an “evil act,” had changed him “not in the ways you might think.”

“It has only strengthened my faith in God and it’s really crystallized what shows up as the goodness in people,” he said.

Scalise did his first interview, with “60 Minutes” this week, about the attack:

Don't Be These People Breaking 72-Hour Rule On Las Vegas Shooting,"After the mass shooting in Las Vegas last night, it’s time to invoke the 72-hour rule for shootings and terrorist attacks. The rule is: offer immediate sympathy and aid for the victims and their families, but shut up about the political implications, and for crying out loud stop trying to score partisan points for at least 72 hours afterward.

This is partly out of consideration for the victims and their families, who deserve not to have their grief exploited. Or, if we’re being realistic, they should at least have a brief respite before their grief is exploited. But the 72-hour rule also exists to protect you, the commenter—whether amateur or professional—from saying something embarrassingly stupid. Or, if we’re being realistic, this should at least provide a brief respite before you go off and embarrass yourself later.

Right now, cable news shows and newspaper websites and social media feeds are full of wild speculations about the shooter, his motives, the weapons he used, and the political reforms that will supposedly prevent something tragic like this from ever happening again (but probably won’t). Most of it will be wrong. Even the stuff that is not just a rumor on the Internet but seems to have a legitimate source will be wrong. Even things announced by the authorities in the early hours of the attack will be wrong. People speculate. People jump to conclusions based on incomplete data. Insiders make up facts and pass along incomplete, poorly understand information because they like attention from reporters. Eyewitnesses misremember events or pass on speculations as if they were truth.

We know all of this, because it happens with every mass shooting, every terror attack, every controversial police shooting. It takes days, weeks, months to filter through all of the noise and sort fact from fiction.

But a lot of people aren’t going to wait. Here’s a brief and, I am sure, very incomplete catalog of some of the many stupid, totally speculative, offensively political, and contradictory things being said right now by people who aren’t following the 72-hour rule.

“Gateway Pundit” blogger Jim Hoft said the shooter was an anti-Trump Democrat—but Hoft got the wrong guy. Instead, the shooter is a Muslim convert and the attack was orchestrated by ISIS! Or maybe not.

Imagine what would have happened if the shooter had a silencer, asks noted firearms expert Hillary Clinton, who goes on to ask us to put aside politics so that we can focus on, er, politics.

Our grief isn’t enough. We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again. — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 2, 2017

The shooter’s gun was an AR-15, because all scary guns are AR-15s. And it was a fully automatic machine gun (except that the AR-15 is not fully automatic). Or maybe it was a semi-automatic gun using a “bump stock” to simulate automatic firing. Meanwhile, law enforcement has so far released no information about the weapon or weapons used by the shooter or how they were acquired.

Finally, there are the blazing hot takes by people carelessly popping off their mouths, such as declaring that they have no sympathy for the victims because they were country music fans, and country music fans like guns, so they all had it coming. Or Harvard librarians telling us that “Angry white men are the USA’s deadliest terrorist threat.”

Angry white men are the USA’s deadliest terrorist threat. Every day they are being armed and radicalized by the NRA. https://t.co/t9GCE8Jg7b — John Overholt (@john_overholt) October 2, 2017

Do you know why this happens? Because you—the viewers, readers, and retweeters—let it happen. They bring these idiots onto the TV shows to blather about all the different speculative scenarios because you don’t have the patience to wait until real facts are available. People say horrible and ugly things on Twitter because you reward them with a lot of attention.

Don’t let this be you. Restrain yourself, in these first hours of the news of an attack, from the temptation of using random reports as the opportunity to either reinforce or defend your pre-existing political preferences. In most cases, shooting off your mouth now won’t make you look prescient. It will make you look small, angry, petty, and unscrupulous.

Wait for Wednesday night or, better yet, Thursday morning. Go from what the authorities and reputable reporters say—and even then, assume that at least a third of it will later turn out to be wrong. Do it out of respect for the victims, and do it if you want to be able to respect yourself later.

France’s Terrorism-Prompted Restrictions On Civil Liberties Make Sense,"Although it didn’t receive a lot of press, on Sunday in the main train station of the southern French city of Marseille, a man who reportedly shouted “Allahu Akbar” stabbed one young woman in the stomach and slit the throat of another before being shot by police. Both the victims died. ISIS claimed responsibility.

France hasn’t had a large-scale ISIS attack since last summer, but it has experienced numerous small-scale attacks like this. These smaller attacks often result in no casualties and, because they frequently involve knives and cars rather than bombs and guns, receive relatively little media attention here in the United States. In France and across the European continent, such attacks are becoming almost quotidian.

Yet it’s important not to forget that regardless of how poorly equipped or trained the men and women who launch a terrorist attack might be, it is their intention to do as much damage as possible. It’s also crucial to remember that the Muslim followers of ISIS and its religious ideology aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. That’s something the French government, at least, isn’t having any trouble remembering.

Just two days after the Marseille knife attack, the French parliament assembled to vote on a new and controversial counter-terrorism bill proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron. The fast-tracked bill is meant to provide a way for France to end a state of emergency that was first put into place in November 2015, after the attack on the Bataclan music venue in Paris. The state of emergency has since been extended five times.

A Permanent State of Emergency

Under the state of emergency, police have the ability to search homes and properties without a warrant, put individuals under house arrest, impose curfew in certain areas, or forbid gatherings. All this can be done without judicial oversight, in the name of national security.

Macron has promised to end the state of emergency by passing legislation for a new counter-terrorism law. But that bill, which the lower house of parliament passed Tuesday, has received serious criticism. The problem is that the law would simply shift many of the temporary provisions of the state of emergency into permanent ones, making the move largely one of optics rather than substance.

The Human Rights Watch argues the new law will perpetuate the human rights abuses it says have occurred throughout the current state of emergency. United Nations human rights experts say that normalizing emergency powers “has grave consequences for the integrity of rights protection in France, both within and beyond the context of counter-terrorism.”

What specifically worries these groups is the possibility that French security forces will disproportionately and unfairly profile and target Muslims in an effort to prevent future terrorist attacks. That’s because the law would allow the police to assign areas as security zones if authorities perceive a threat, then limit movement within and through that area, as well as carry out searches. Since many of France’s Muslims live in concentrated neighborhoods, especially on the outskirts of cities, it would be easy for police to clamp down on them as it sees fit. What’s more, French police could shut down mosques if they think religious leaders there are inciting violence or encouraging terrorism.

A Perpetual State of War

But that is not, apparently, how French lawmakers by-and-large view the matter. To them, France is under attack and must protect itself. France’s Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told France Inter radio, “We are still in a state of war. We have foiled numerous attacks since the start of the year that would have led to many deaths.” As if to prove his point, police arrested five men in Paris on Tuesday who are suspected of being involved in a failed attempt to detonate a bomb in a swanky apartment building in the 16th arrondissement.

The way Macron and his government see things, the emergency powers are what allowed for preventing another large-scale attack. Without them, France would find itself more bloodied than it already is.

Moreover, France’s problem can’t be solved by travel restrictions because it is largely homegrown. The country is home to the largest Muslim population in Europe, mostly from its former colonies in North Africa, and the relationship between French Muslims and the rest of France is strained, to say the least. Both because of their ostracization and self-imposed segregation, an alarming number of French Muslims have proven open or vulnerable to the Islamic State’s violent mission to attack to the West.

Macron’s new legislation certainly does give the police sweeping powers that could easily be abused, and given human nature, most certainly will be. But French leaders finds themselves in a terrible position. They know that the majority of security threats come from sections of the Muslim population and from some, although not all, of its mosques. France has to be able to address that risk through increased scrutiny and the power to intervene when necessary. At the same time, France is supposed to be a liberal democracy that protects basic civil rights.

Safety Versus Freedom

So how does a nation like France balance a desire to be free with a desire to be safe? It’s the same question that many Americans are asking in the days following the Las Vegas shooting—is our safety worth stripping Americans of their Second Amendment rights? Right now, many on the Left are saying “yes,” as they have been for years. It’s also a question America has had to deal with on surveillance in the years following 9/11 and the 2001 Patriot Act.

But when it comes to Muslims, terrorism, and national security, the United States and France have had very different reactions. While France is moving toward stricter scrutiny of mosques and increased police powers, the dominant U.S. narrative, especially in the media, is that Muslims shouldn’t be scrutinized any more than any other religion is for national security.

We saw this phenomenon manifest itself in the uproar over the Trump administration’s series of travel bans that targeted Muslim-majority countries. It’s also why you often see grandmothers and small children being thoroughly patted down at the airport, as if they represent just as much of a security risk as any other demographic. For better or worse, the United States has thus far resisted the urge to engage in racial profiling, no matter the security risks.

But the United States is not France. It doesn’t have the same perspective or the same experiences (nor, obviously, the same laws or constitutional protections). France has also borne the brunt of ISIS attacks in Europe since the group emerged on the international scene in 2015, and has seen more than 240 people killed by the group’s followers on French soil. Every time a new attack takes place, accusations fly about how the security forces should have seen this coming.

That’s what Macron is trying to fix with this new counter-terrorism bill. The fact is, in the age of ISIS the constant threat of terrorist attacks, both large and small, has become the new reality for Europe. Americans might express their disapproval of the strict measures Macron is proposing, but it’s worth remembering that we in the United States don’t face the steady, seemingly endless stream of attacks that Europeans do today.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/10/04/dont-quick-condemn-frances-terrorism-prompted-restrictions-civil-liberties/,2017-10-04
Here's Everything We Know About The NYC Attack,"At least eight people have died and an additional 15 people have been injured in an incident that’s being investigated as a terror attack on Tuesday afternoon in New York City.

Officials say 29-year-old Sayfullo Saipov of Tampa, Florida plowed into pedestrians and bicyclists on a crowded jogging path in Lower Manhattan with a rented flatbed truck before slamming into a school bus that blocked his path. Two adults and two children aboard the bus were injured in the crash. The suspect, who has been apprehended, reportedly shouted “Allahu Akbar” upon exiting the vehicle and was holding what appeared to be two handguns. These turned out to be a paintball gun and a pellet gun.

Saipov was shot in the abdomen by police and has been hospitalized. Federal authorities are investigating the incident as a terror attack.

“Based on information we have at this moment, this was an act of terror, and a particularly cowardly act of terror aimed at innocent civilians,” said New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio in a press conference following the attack.

ISIS-Inspired Truck Attacks Come To New York City,"Yesterday, New York City experienced the deadliest terror attack since the World Trade Center towers were hit on September 11, 2001. A 29-year-old man, Sayfullo Saipov, drove a truck down a bike path that runs along the Hudson River in Manhattan, killing eight people and injuring 11 more before crashing into a school bus. The police shot him in the stomach, but not before he could yell, “Allahu akbar.” Investigators found handwritten notes in Arabic in the truck declaring loyalty to ISIS.

Saipov is a Muslim from Uzbekistan, a former Soviet Republic that borders Afghanistan, and came to the United States legally in 2010. He rented the pick-up truck he used in the attack at a Home Depot in New Jersey, where he had been living. It appears the attacker was on federal authorities’ radar, but it’s not clear how or why.

According to The New York Times, “Three officials said he had come to the federal authorities’ attention as a result of an unrelated investigation, but it was not clear whether that was because he was a friend, an associate or a family member of someone under scrutiny or because he himself had been the focus of an investigation.”

This attack marks the first significant instance in America of the kind of vehicular ISIS attacks that have become frequent in European countries. Last year, a student at the Ohio State University drove his car into pedestrians, although no one was killed.

It’s one of the simplest ways for ISIS followers to launch an attack—all they have to do is rent a truck and find a busy street. That’s why ISIS urges this method, which first appeared in the deadly Bastille Day attack in Nice, France last summer that killed 86 people. Since then, there have been similar attacks in Berlin, London (three times), Stockholm, and Barcelona. Now, New York has been added to the group.

ISIS Is Effective By Eschewing Central Planning

ISIS hasn’t claimed the attack yet, despite evidence Saipov was a follower of the group, and it’s possible that it may never do so. As ISIS expert Rukmini Callimachi explained on Twitter, the Islamic State rarely claims responsibility for attacks in which the attacker has been taken into custody instead of killed.

So far, investigators haven’t uncovered evidence of any direct ties between Saipov and ISIS and are reportedly treating the attack as “inspired” by the group. It makes sense to classify ISIS attacks differently depending on whether they were centrally planned or inspired. However, one gets the sense that many view attacks like these as merely inspired, as though inspired attacks are somehow less deadly.

But as we should all know by now, the genius of ISIS is that it doesn’t have to centrally plan all of its attacks. The terrorist group relies on the far-reaching influence of its ideology and the fact that Muslims in any part of the world can “convert,” in a manner of speaking, to the fundamentalist interpretation of Islam it espouses.

For attacking western countries — most especially the United States — this aspect of their structure is most helpful to them, and most difficult to defend against. Rather than infiltrating a country or setting up a terror cell, the group merely relies on its followers in the places where they live. ISIS just has to keep inspiring its adherents. Tuesday’s attack indicates that despite the recent loss of most of its territory in Iraq and Syria, ISIS can still do just that.

Trump’s Travel Ban Isn’t Enough

This point is also important because it’s a reminder that President Trump’s much-contested travel ban would have done nothing to stop Saipov from driving his truck down that bike path. Uzbekistan isn’t on the list of countries included in the administration’s latest version of the ban. Tuesday’s attack should draw attention to the fact that many former Soviet republics have a growing problem with radical Islam — that area of the world is responsible for sending the largest number of foreign fighters to join ISIS in Syria.

To be fair, the travel ban never claimed to be able to prevent all terror attacks. But while it’s reasonable to want to restrict travel from countries that can’t provide sufficient information about their citizens who seek entry to America, the ban doesn’t address the way in which the Islamic State’s ideology spreads, nor its non-centralized network of adherents, many of whom are unknown even to ISIS leaders.

This means attacks like these are difficult to prevent and quite literally can occur anywhere at any time. As we hear more news of ISIS’ dwindling numbers and shrinking territory overseas, there is a risk that western countries might soon face the prospect of attacks by battle-hardened ISIS fighters returning home who have been trained to inflict maximum damage.

For now, Tuesday’s attack in New York is a somber reminder that we’re not out of the woods yet, and we never will be so long as men and women out there believe what ISIS believes.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/11/01/isis-inspired-truck-attacks-come-new-york-city/,2017-11-01
First 3 Phases Of The Downward Slope From Freedom To Communism,"November 7 marks the centennial of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. There are many reasons beyond the historical to ponder the legacy of communism. Ever since Vladimir Lenin overthrew Russia’s nascent parliamentary democracy in 1917 to establish a brutal dictatorship, many other nations have fallen for the bait-and-switch scheme called communism, and often labelled socialism.

Communism promises equality but delivers scarcity for all but the elites in its apparatus. It pitches social justice and delivers mass enslavement, widespread misery, social distrust, and severe punishment for all who might dissent. We’ve seen these phenomena happen all over the world, in China, North Korea, Southeast Asia, post-World War II Eastern Europe, Cuba, Central America, and perhaps most notably visible today in the starvation and chaos of Venezuela.

During the twentieth century—and let’s remember this is recent history—communist regimes murdered more than 100 million people. This sort of astounding cruelty is in the very nature of the beast called communism. It happens when too much power gets concentrated into the hands of too few people.

Yet Americans have a sad history of flirting with this disaster and many American elites, from 1930s intellectuals to 1960s radicals, have accepted it completely. We’re seeing another revival today: Bernie Sanders is a self-professed socialist, and The New York Times recently ran an article doting on the good old days when communism inspired so many in America.

So, the questions Americans might best ask themselves today are as follows: How might a nation “conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal” ever buy into the lies of communism, a system tailor-made for state mass murder? How might a free people ever allow the abolition of a Constitution that guarantees individual rights, the rule of law, due process, and is designed to thwart elites from gaining absolute power over others? Why would anyone, except an advocate of slavery, throw away a document designed from its very inception to abolish slavery in all of its forms?

In a recent article, I sketched out six phases on the road to communism, and summarized the trends in each phase: 1.) Laying the groundwork; 2.) Propaganda; 3.) Agitating the masses; 4.) Consolidating control over society’s institutions; 5.) Coercing conformity; and 6.) Final solutions. This follow-up article will examine the trends in the three earlier phases. The third article in this series will examine the trends most associated with the three latter phases.

Several of these phases, which are roughly sequential, overlap a lot. But I think it’s useful to at least try to understand how a phenomenon that can cause so much human misery and mass murder can possibly gain a foothold in a free nation. If we can dissect it and study it all more closely, perhaps we can sidestep some of the pitfalls that drag us down communism’s path of human cruelty and evil.

Phase 1: Trends that Lay Groundwork for Tyranny

The first phase towards tyranny in a free society is a generational or decades-long process. It’s a period in which minds can be closed to reason and more influenced by emotion and propaganda. Even at institutions of supposedly higher learning, students start to lose their capacity to think independent thoughts. We might summarize this as the conditioning phase—maybe the “programming” stage—that paves the way for groupthink to solidify. Below I list some of the trends in this phase.

Creep of social policies that promote polarization, dependency, and human isolation. All so-called progressive policies cause division and isolation among people. For example, economic policies that promote dependency create more class divisions and hostility. When we codify policies that bow down to identity politics, we fuel divisions by race, class, sex, religion, and so forth. All such policies tend to wreak havoc on personal relationships.

The metastasizing of the welfare state under President Lyndon Johnson caused a lot of dependency. Some of its offshoots, such as “Aid to Families with Dependent Children,” perpetuated family breakdown with a carrot-and-stick effect that rewarded single motherhood then financially punished the family if the mother married.

The list of policies that breed human isolation goes on: Policies that promote the sexual revolution discourage bonds of marriage and family; No-fault divorce promotes the separation of spouses. Policies that punish married parents and reward single parenthood promote the separation of children from their parents. Also, no matter how you feel about abortion, you can’t deny that it erodes the social value given to the mother-child bond.

Broken families lead to broken communities. We can see how those earlier policies that promoted isolation continue to proliferate today, from the threat of rationing from state-run health care to euthanasia as a byproduct of abortion on demand. The effects of such policies include the loneliness epidemic we’re seeing today, demoralization, and social chaos.

Disabling of independent thought. Nothing is more threatening to petty dictators than a citizenry’s widespread ability to think clearly and independently. Radical education reformers have sought for generations to drum the capacity for independent thought out of students. “Critical thinking” has been made into a garbage term for fads that have students doing anything but gain content knowledge.

Most college students today probably could not answer even a fraction of the questions on an eighth grade general knowledge exam from 1912. Without core knowledge, people have a difficult time putting any knowledge into its proper context. After decades of such politicizing reforms, you can end up with college students so muddled in their thinking that they need “trigger warnings” before reading anything that might conflict with the social and emotional programming they’ve experienced. In the propaganda phase, we’ll see how political correctness compounds this problem by cultivating the fear of rejection for expressing one’s thoughts.

Ever more bureaucratization. Human freedom is inversely proportional to the bloat of the administrative state. I’m not sure who should be credited with first making this observation. It resounds in the work of the American Founders, Alexis de Tocqueville, Friedrich Hayek, and even the psychiatrist Carl Jung, among many others. But the piles of regulations that put businesses, as well as personal lives, into straitjackets attest to this destabilizing trend for human freedom.

You can trace this back quite a ways, particularly with President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal programs put into place to address the Great Depression. But it certainly helped put into high gear the bloat we see today. Compounding the problem is the notion that immigration should be limitless and the nation borderless, despite a national debt of $20 trillion. The metastasis of bureaucracy is a huge indicator we’ve been on the path to centralized power that feeds corruption and lays groundwork for communism.

Erasure of collective memory. Another crime of radical education reform is its attack on the study of history, civics, and the classics of literature. Today we can see the bitter fruits of such 1960s radical education reform, which has roots going back to 1920s with John Dewey. If we are no longer able to place ourselves and society into the context of historical events, our vision going forward will be blurred at best.

It gets even worse if we don’t learn how our form of government functions. Today fewer and fewer college students have the capacity to understand that the First Amendment serves as a buffer against totalitarianism, not something to be abolished under the pretext of “hate speech.” And depriving students exposure to literary classics like Shakespeare (based on the charge that such works are “Western” and therefore ethnocentric) prevents them from discussing the universal human condition and our common humanity.

Instead, students are increasingly fed grievance studies and identity politics. As universities go this route, it trickles down to K-12 education. As a result, we are losing the social glue of our common traditions and heritage—not just as a nation, but as human beings. This cultivation of ignorance by the education establishment over the years compounds the isolating effect on people. It makes youth especially vulnerable to becoming fodder for power elites.

Hoarding of knowledge about group dynamics. Are you tuned in to how the laws of social psychology drive your behavior? Or how the manipulation of the primal human fear of being isolated and rejected allows for PC-induced self-censorship that fuels conformity? How groupthink affects us? Probably not.

Thirty years ago, Nobel laureate Doris Lessing wrote about this deficit in general knowledge. In her book, “Prisons We Choose to Live Inside,” Lessing theorized that power elites have actually hoarded knowledge of mass psychology so they can better control the masses. Her thesis makes sense: If everyone understood the manipulators’ game, the game would be over for them.

Phase 2: Manufacturing Propaganda

Propaganda is not so much a phase as an ever-present nuisance. But once its groundwork has been laid in the minds of men, propaganda’s intensity and effectiveness increases in direct proportion to the ignorance out there. You’ll find many definitions of propaganda, but my definition goes like this: Propaganda is the process by which power elites condition individuals through psychological manipulation to adapt to an agenda. Some of its trends are as follows.

Language manipulation. The whole point of the totalitarian abuse of language is to prevent independent thought, the subject of George Orwell’s essay “Politics and the English Language.” When people accept the abuse of language, and incorporate it into their own vocabularies without thinking about it, they can be easily ventriloquized by power elites.

Victor Klemperer addressed this phenomenon in his book “Language of the Third Reich.” His thesis was that the Nazi regime’s abuse of language was its primary means of turning all German people into Nazis. He writes, “They found it difficult to think about life and morality in any other way. . . .Words are like tiny doses of arsenic, swallowed unnoticed, and then after a while the toxic reaction sets in.”

His thesis was that the Nazi regime’s abuse of language was its primary means of turning all German people into Nazis.

Consider all the weaponized memes and slogans we swallow today that shape how we think: “woke,” “bend the knee,” and “cisgender” are just a few. All are meant to modify our thoughts and behaviors in everyday life. An especially aggressive abuse of language are new laws that enforce strange pronoun usages that destabilize the structure of our language. By passing laws that punish the “misgendering” of someone as “hate speech,” we veer into kangaroo court territory, as well as force unnatural changes in our language.

Revising history. A byproduct of watering down of the study of history is the revision and mockery of history, such as is evident in the late Howard Zinn’s textbook, “The People’s History of the United States.” His basic thesis appears to be that our constitutional system of checks and balances needs to be replaced by an oligarchy of dictators such as himself who know better. It seems to teach students that everything that ever happened at the founding of America is bad, bad, bad. Such revisionism also serves to perpetuate identity politics that stokes resentments rather than building any sense of unity among Americans.

Journalism becomes propaganda. There was once a quaint notion that reporting should be objective and fact-based rather than biased and opinion-based. Journalists tend to view themselves as watchdogs, yet over the years have become increasingly unaccountable to anyone. As the profession’s political shift to the Left has crystallized to beyond 90 percent, it’s now so monolithic in its perspective that it can hardly help but churn out propaganda.

When I wrote a Federalist article entitled “How Journalism Turns into Propaganda,” I focused on the story “Angi Vera,” from a Hungarian film. It revealed how the communists in Hungary, once they seized power in 1947, used education camps to develop a compliant class of leaders to replace the old order. The title character quickly learned the art of propaganda compliance, with all of the subtle backstabbing it entailed, and she was rewarded by the authorities with a lifelong career in journalism.

New technologies promote political correctness and cult-like mindsets. In 1962, when Daniel Boorstin published “The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America,” he warned how glomming onto new technologies like television was making us more susceptible to accepting images as reality. We were losing our ability to thoughtfully deliberate about ideas and events. He anticipated this would get worse as then-yet-to-be-invented technologies would shift us even more quickly into substituting pseudo-reality for reality.

Wow, was he ever right. No doubt the Internet, cell phone technologies, and social media endlessly present illusions in place of reality. At the same time, they solidify political correctness. And since the main purpose of political correctness is to achieve conformity of thought, we ought to ask: Where does conformity of thought takes us, if left to its own devices? It’s a dream-come-true for totalitarians who no doubt hope for a conformity that would allow them to remake the world in their own image.

Such conformity would morph into a globalized cult mindset that crosses through all segments of society: politics, education, medicine, the media, and the corporate world, to name just a few sectors. Psychiatrist and cult expert Margaret Thaler Singer called this “the psycho-technology of thought reform,” and warned it was very real and not going to go away, adding that “Education, information, and vigilance are needed to keep us and our minds free.”

Phase 3: Agitation and Mass Mobilization

The whole point of propaganda is to drive people to action, according to Jacques Ellul, author of the 1962 classic “Propaganda: The Formation of Men’s Attitudes.” Such action isn’t about freedom of peaceful assembly, which is an American tradition as well as a First Amendment right. From the suffragettes of the early twentieth century to the civil rights marches in the 1960s to the March for Life that began in 1974, Americans tend to gather with those of like mind to march against injustice. But today we can see growing trends towards something very different: street theater that actually serves to shut down freedom of expression. Trends in agitation including the following.

Cultivation of hate and frustration. Can you feel it? There’s a lot of frustration and alienation out there, thanks to groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center who seem deeply invested in perpetuating hate and resentment. Americans are traditionally a big-hearted and happy people, filled with enthusiasm over innovation and goodwill towards all. In part, that’s exactly why the SPLC’s propaganda has worked in the past: because it fulfills the Saul Alinsky rule of using people’s goodwill against them to gain political power.

Alinsky also advocated for the intense polarization we see today, telling “community organizers” to rub victims’ resentments raw, to cultivate intense anger against their perceived oppressors in order to energize mob action. Of course, such power elites who strive for totalitarian rule have always been invested in maintaining a large underclass of people who are kept dependent and ignorant since that builds a sense of frustration and alienation that can be channeled into mobilizing them into mob action.

The history of the recent twentieth century is filled with mass action that led to totalitarian dictatorships.

Mass mobilization. This is the craft of getting the alienated and frustrated masses, programmed by propaganda, to do the bidding of power elites. We saw it happen in Charlottesville, as well as in Berkeley, at Middlebury College, and Dartmouth and many other places. Today the goal is to shut down speech and real conversation. Such mobs generally make a lot of noise and create a lot of action so that they get their way, even if they represent a small minority.

The history of the recent twentieth century is filled with mass action that led to totalitarian dictatorships. Peasants and workers were mobilized to respond to Lenin’s mantra for “peace, land, and bread” as Russians suffered during World War I. It happened as Germans took part en masse to participate in rallies for the Third Reich. Always the Enemy was invoked, whether a class enemy, a race enemy, or any other sort.

Today the term of choice is “white supremacist.” Demagogues stoke resentments until lawlessness and mass violence became the order of the day. But let’s also consider a smaller but significant American example of mob action from 2015: after former governor Mike Pence signed into law Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, mobs of protesters were mobilized to show up and shout his action down, as though they represented majority opinion, when they most certainly did not. Corporations pressured Pence as well.

Sadly, that organized mob action worked, and Republican leadership including Pence altered the bill to suit the protesters. America is now seeing a lot more street theater and violent riots aimed at shutting down conversation on college campuses as well as shutting down law enforcement in cities suffering from high crime rates.

Iconoclasm. The attack on historical monuments may seem to have started with Confederate statues. But it is certainly not ending there. From World War I monuments to statues of Abraham Lincoln and memorials to George Washington, just about any historical monument these days is subject to attack or defacement by agitators induced to action by propaganda. It’s another trend that hastens the erasure of national memory and social cohesion.

Enlisting and confusing the youth. Statist youth leagues have always been a staple of dictators who wish to eliminate family loyalties and religious influences. Although we may not see a Soviet-styled Komsomol in America just yet, there has been an ongoing attack against youth programs that promote self-reliance, independent thought, and the integrity of the family. It’s not just that the Boy Scouts have gone soft. School boards in major districts across the nation are pushing curricula and policies that force children to cater to identity politics, environmentalism, transgenderism, and so much more than children should ever be forced to grapple with.

As children attempt to navigate the perceptions of their peers and the authorities, they learn how they can score points and avoid rejection if they agitate for those agenda items. Children tend to imitate. They will playact various personas at the expense of developing unique personalities, if they are led to believe that is how to gain peer acceptance. Likewise, in higher education students participate in mob action—in particular, shutting down the speech of the politically incorrect—so they can don the persona of “social change agent” or something else the authorities deem acceptable.

All of the above sets the scene for the latter phases in the road to communism and other forms of totalitarianism. Those phases are: consolidating the takeover of society’s institutions; forcing conformity; and final solutions.

It's Past Time For Congress To Stop Writing A Blank Check To Wage War,"White House Chief of Staff and four-star General John Kelly took to the White House press podium recently to remind us all what it means for a U.S. soldier to be killed overseas. In painstaking detail, he outlined the cleaning and embalming process of a soldier’s remains, the way bodies are carefully carried home, and the role of the casualty officer, whose job Kelly described as “break[ing] the heart of a family member.”

Kelly’s remembrance was made all the more significant because he has lived it. His son, Second Lt. Robert Kelly, was slain in Afghanistan in 2010. His brief but powerful comments underscore the very real sacrifices we ask the men and woman in uniform to make on our behalf. They outline the necessary, tangible, and terrible dimension of sending Americans into war.

No one understands the weight of these choices better than current and former soldiers. It is significant, then, that a handful of them have come together to introduce a revised Authorization of Military Force (AUMF)—one that repeals the outdated AUMFs from 2001 and 2002 and replaces them with an updated authorization reflecting the realities of the current fight against terrorism.

The Importance of a War Authorization

An AUMF is, essentially, congressional approval of a pretense for war. It is Congress exercising its constitutional responsibility to determine whether a cause is righteous and essential enough to require the sacrifice of American lives and resources.

Congress understood this in 2001, when the original AUMF was authorized in response to the attacks of 9/11. As written, the AUMF gave the president specific authority to use “necessary and appropriate force” against “nations, organizations or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks” of 9/11. In 2002, it was joined by an AUMF for operations in Iraq.

Since that time, however, the mission has transformed and grown in scope. So much, in fact, that the 2001 authorization has now been used to justify U.S. military action more than 37 times in 14 different countries. The further we travel from 2001, the more distant and tangential military action becomes from the authority used to justify it.

Current U.S. counterterrorism operations are active in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Yemen, and elsewhere, all under the authority of the 2001 AUMF, which was intended only to sanction individuals directly involved in the 9/11 attacks. Indeed, at a Senate Foreign Relations hearing earlier this year, former Bush National Security Council legal advisor John Bellinger struggled to link the U.S. shoot-down of a Syrian fighter plane with the authority of the 2001 AUMF used to justify it.

“It’s hard for me to see that Congress, by authorizing the use of force against organization and nations and groups that committed the 9/11 attacks, authorized the use of force against Syria,” he said.

This Is a Dereliction of Congress’s Duty

In relying on out-of-date AUMFs—the 2001 AUMF is now the longest standing congressional authorization for the use of force in American history—Congress is failing in its constitutional responsibility to provide oversight and strategic political leadership in the deployment of our military, not to mention their moral obligation to our armed forces.

The military strategist Carl von Clausewitz established the dictum that war is the continuation of politics by other means. Our Constitution recognizes this by vesting Congress with the role of authorizing military force. As George Washington put it in 1793, “The Constitution vests the power of declaring war in Congress.” Thus, “there can be no offensive expedition of importance … until after they have deliberated upon the subject and authorized such a measure.”

This is even more significant when one considers that most members of Congress were elected after the 2001 AUMF went into effect and have never had an opportunity to be part of a serious discussion about its continued relevance. As a result, neither has the American public. Without this national discourse, a critical disconnect is corroding the essential bonds between the will of the people and the military actions its government is pursuing.

The new AUMF introduced in the House last month seeks to remedy this by repealing the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs, and replacing them with a five-year authorization for military action against al-Qaeda, the Taliban, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (SIS), and those working with them. Critically, this version comes with a five-year sunset provision and a requirement for the executive to submit progress reports to Congress every 90 days.

The introduction of this AUMF and upcoming Senate hearings are refreshing attempts by Congress to take back its constitutional war-making mandate. Congress must commit to reexamine the scope of the threat and the necessity for force to provide security for Americans, and do so on a continuing basis. At a minimum, Congress should spend as much time considering their duty to authorize war as our troops do preparing to wage it.

CNN’s Self-Congratulation After Trump’s Attack Only Illustrates His Point,"During the eight years of Barack Obama’s presidency, Fox News was a constant and public focus of his disdain. Yet the negative attention didn’t daunt the network, which largely took the abuse as validation not only of many of their viewers’ desire to hold the administration accountable but also of journalists’ traditional mission to keep the party in power honest. But now that another news channel is in the crosshairs of Obama’s successor, the response is very different.

After months of attacks from Trump on what he terms CNN’s “fake news,” the president finally seemed to hit a nerve when one of his tweets over the holiday weekend targeted CNN International: “.@FoxNews is MUCH more important in the United States than CNN, but outside of the U.S., CNN International is still a major source of (Fake) news, and they represent our Nation to the WORLD very poorly. The outside world does not see the truth from them!”

Rather than take it in stride, CNN responded with an orgy of self-congratulation. In a video lead news anchor Wolf Blitzer first presented on his midday show, the network proclaimed itself as the home of journalist heroes braving bullets, natural disasters, and angry mobs to bring the news to the public.

CNN International correspondents like Ben Wedeman and Clarissa Ward testified to the risks they run pursuing stories. War correspondent Christiane Amanpour not only boasted of the bullets she had dodged but mentioned a colleague who took a bullet in the face covering the conflict in Bosnia.

This Is All Beside the Point, CNN

While CNN’s efforts to highlight its achievements were as truthful as Trump’s gibe was hyperbolic, their riposte also didn’t speak to the reason so many on the Right have no problem with the president’s attack. The network generally remains a good source of up-to-date information on natural disasters, terrorist incidents, and wars, which accounts for the uptick in their ratings during such crises.

But as anyone who watches CNN daily knows, its political reporting regarding the Trump administration, panels of talking heads, and some of its prime-time hosts betray an obvious leftward tilt that is hard for even the network’s most dedicated fans to deny. In the age of Trump, CNN is a channel with an agenda to oppose if not actually “resist” the administration. That’s why liberals like CNN and Trump feels entitled to attack it, knowing full well that many who back him agree with the general meaning of his barbs, if not every detail.

To acknowledge CNN’s bias is not the same thing as condoning the labeling of everything they do as “fake news.” Just as liberals won’t acknowledge the solid news reporting done by Fox News correspondents and hosts like Brett Baier, who are primarily interested in the news and not purveyors of opinion, it would be wrong for conservatives to deny that a lot of what CNN produces is valuable.

Sure, There Are Fair Points to Critique

The timing of Trump’s latest brickbat aimed at the network was also bad since it coincided with the Russian government’s latest effort to crack down on foreign media that report about the Putin regime’s human rights violations. CNN’s attempt to claim Trump endangered its reporters was as hyperbolic as anything the president says since neither Vladimir Putin nor any other foreign dictator needs any encouragement from Trump to launch physical attacks or deny freedom to the press. Mere criticism of the media, even of the harshest variety, is not comparable to what happens in Russia, but it is nonetheless bad optics for Trump to invite the comparison.

The constant refrain of “fake news” has contributed to a political culture in which liberals and conservatives tend to view everything they read, hear, and see as a form of political propaganda. In our bifurcated media culture, that means many in the audience judge the validity of news solely by whether it confirms their pre-existing biases.

We saw the toxic nature of such constant accusations when James O’Keefe and his Project Veritas provocateurs tried to execute a sting against the Washington Post. While O’Keefe’s efforts to expose the depraved cynicism of Planned Parenthood executives were successful, what is being reported as his attempt to plant a false story about Roy Moore committing a sexual offense — presumably to then debunk it and demonstrate the Post’s eagerness to defame a conservative — backfired. Rather than feed the conservative narrative of media bias that has allowed the Republican senatorial candidate’s defenders to dismiss the accusations against him, O’Keefe wound up highlighting the reliability of the Post’s investigation.

But even if we concede that, like the Post’s scrupulousness in seeking to verify its stories on Moore, CNN and its international reporters generate a lot of accurate news stories, that doesn’t get the network off the hook for much of its programming bias against Trump.

CNN Is Essentially an Anti-Trump Pile-On

Since the inauguration, CNN has largely given up any pretense of objectivity about the Trump presidency. Its panels of commentators heard throughout a typical day rarely contain even a token Trump supporter to balance liberal critics and conservatives who also despise the president. Most news stories about Trump come in as an outrage a day featuring whatever outrageous tweet or utterance (on Monday it was his ill-timed reference to Sen. Elizabeth Warren as “Pocahantas” during a ceremony honoring Native American World War Two vets).

But early on the network’s reporters and on-air personalities decided that they were not prepared to treat anything the president did or said as defensible or even a matter of opinion. Most CNN discussions of Trump consist of reporters, guest commentators, and hosts agreeing with each other about the awful nature of whatever he has done or said. They frame most stories about Trump and his administration as an outrage about which decent people cannot agree to disagree.

Were this limited to the network’s opinionated hosts, especially those in prime time like Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon, who compete with the even more liberal personalities on MSNBC as well as the conservative talkers on Fox, it might be considered defensible in this hyper-partisan age. But the same spirit extends into the work of its on-air reporters, who might otherwise be expected to give us, as the graphic behind Blitzer on Monday proclaimed, “facts first.”

Example Numero Uno: Jim Acosta

A prime example is CNN White House Correspondent Jim Acosta. He routinely frames his reports as accusations against Trump, generously sprinkling his negative opinions about administration policies in with the “facts” he reports.

One especially egregious incident took place last summer when, during a White House presser where Senior Advisor Stephen Miller discussed immigration policy. Acosta didn’t question Miller about Trump’s stands. He debated him, citing the poem on the Statue of Liberty as proof of the wrongful nature of Trump’s policy. Speaking like one of Stalin’s prosecutors during the great purge trials rather than a reporter seeking to elicit information, his question was an accusation that he dared Miller to deny.

At a news organization where the church-state divide between news and opinion was given even a modicum of respect, Acosta might have faced discipline for that particular exhibition of blatant bias and been reassigned. But he remains in his post, more or less constantly adding to his litany of opinionated reports that are, in effect, jeremiads against all things Trump rather than facts.

Under these circumstances, it is hardly surprising that many conservatives are wary of anything CNN reports even if it is, like the accusations against Moore, highly credible

Serious news consumers read or watch everything with a critical mind, always seeking to discount for possible biases. That means accepting that any network may sometimes produce solid stories. But so long as CNN continues to tilt its news as well as its opinion segments against Trump, their complaints about their virtue will continue to ring hollow.

How Prayers Saved My Life During The First Iraq War,"When a murderous gunman mercilessly slaughtered 26 innocent men, woman, and children, many of the nation’s leaders called the nation to prayer. Among the first was President Donald Trump, who was in Japan on an extended trip to Asia.

The president appealed to God to be with the people of Sutherland; “May God be with the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas.” The president added, “All Americans pray to God to help the wounded and the families of the victims.” House Speaker Paul Ryan followed the president’s appeal, saying, “The people of Sutherland Springs need our prayers right now.”

The subsequent response from the political left was swift and nauseating, often taking the form of mockery and self-righteous condemnation. These hate-filled rants condemned the call for prayer, then went on to politicize the tragedy to advocate government gun control. It would be one thing if the rabid anti-prayer response were from anonymous bloggers, but the attack on prayer took a decided turn when politicians took it up.

Among the first was Rep. Ted Lieu of California, who walked out of a minute of silence in the House of Representatives set aside to pray for the victims of the Sutherland attack. While Congress prayed for the victims, Lieu filmed his walk-out on Facebook, self-righteously exclaiming that he could not do this again. The optics of men, woman, and children needing his prayer and support in Texas hospitals while Lieu callously exploited the event to advance a personal political agenda seems lost on the congressman.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, from Washington, joined the growing chorus against a call for mourning and praying for the victims of the Texas, tweeting, “They don’t need our prayers. They need us to address gun violence crisis & pass sensible regulation.” The heartlessness of such comments is disturbing, and betrays a disconcerting trend in the United States.

This Is Not the America We Have Known

Such hostility to prayer in time of adversity and trouble is new to the nation. For most of the nation’s history, prayer was respected and expected in time of crisis. Even those who may have disagreed with prayer respectfully set aside their political agendas to support the appeals to heaven for wisdom, healing, and guidance. Among the strongest calls for prayer in the nation’s history arguably occurred in 1787 during the Constitution Convention. When the meeting floundered, Benjamin Franklin rose and said,

I will suggest, Mr. President, that propriety of nominating and appointing, before we separate, a chaplain to this Convention, whose duty it shall be uniformly to assemble with us, and introduce the business of each day by and address to the Creator of the universe, and the Governor of all nations, beseeching Him to preside in our council, enlighten our minds with a portion of heavenly wisdom, influence our hearts with a love of truth and justice, and crown our labors with complete and abundant success!

Franklin’s statement resulted in two chaplains being hired to lead prayer for God’s blessing and guidance in Congress. This remains in place to this very day.

There are scores of other examples from across the nation’s 241 years of national leaders calling for prayer during times of trials and calamity. Among the most moving was President Lincoln’s call for prayer and fasting after the defeat of the Union Army at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861. Never was the survival of the nation more at question then at this moment. In this hour of need, the president wrote;

It is fit and becoming in all people, at all times, to acknowledge and revere the Supreme Government of God; to bow in humble submission to His chastisement; to confess and deplore their sins and transgressions in the full conviction that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; and to pray, with all fervency and contrition, for the pardon of their past offenses, and for a blessing upon their present and prospective action. And whereas when our own beloved country, once, by the blessings of God, united, prosperous and happy, is now afflicted with faction and civil war, it is peculiarly fit for us to recognize the hand of God in this terrible visitation, and in sorrowful remembrance of our own faults and crimes as a nation and as individuals, to humble ourselves before Him and to pray for His mercy…that the inestimable boon of civil and religious liberty, earned under His guidance and blessing by the labors and sufferings of our fathers, may be restored.

Americans Still See the Effects of Prayer

In my lifetime, I too have witnessed and felt the effects of the nation praying. This unforgettable time occurred during Desert Storm. Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein ordered an invasion and occupation of Kuwait in August 1990. In response, the United States organized a large multi-national coalition to liberate Kuwait.

I deployed to Saudi Arabia with the Second Armored Cavalry Regiment. Our task was to lead the main attack into southern Iraq as part of the VII Corps to engage and destroy Saddam’s elite Republican Guards. President H.W. Bush called the nation to prayer in this time of war. The American people embraced this request and “pray for our troops” became an improvised national motto, with yellow ribbons being tied to trees and telephone poles to remind people to pray. My wife Rebecca rallied more than 20 churches to specifically to pray for my unit.

A swift and easy victory over the Iraqi Army was not a foregone conclusion. During the buildup to war, we were told to anticipate high casualties and a hard fight against our adversaries. This is where prayer made the difference. Our chief concern was the Iraqi Army using chemical weapons once we attacked.

All the indications were that Saddam would do this. Baghdad used chemical weapons extensively during its long war against Iran (1980-1988), and even against its own Kurdish people (1988). The prevailing winds generally blew out of Iraqi into Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. This meant that the environment favored Iraqi use of chemical weapons. Yet prayer changed the course of nature and perhaps the outcome of the war.

The Second Armored Cavalry Regiment began the attack into Iraq the day before the actual ground war. Artillery and U.S. Air Force aircraft bombarded forward Iraq positions while our tanks advanced. As the first of our tanks crossed into Iraq at 1:30 p.m. on 23 February 1991, I witnessed the wind literally change direction from its northwesterly prevailing course to a southwesterly one.

I was speechless, for as the unit’s intelligence officer (S2), I spoke often of the problem the prevailing winds posed. The wind change meant the Iraqi Army could not use chemical weapons, as the wind would blow it back on its own troops. The precise timing of this can only be the result of prayer.

That Wasn’t the Only Miracle We Saw

This was not the only weather phenomenon to give us the decided favor in what otherwise should have been a costly war for the United States and its coalition partners. The last major tank engagements of the twentieth century was called the Battle of 73rd Easting. It was 26 February 1991, and my regiment was about to begin its tank battle against the Iraqi Republican Guards. The morning began with artillery strikes and USAF engagements against the enemy tank formations (which were dug into the desert).

As our tanks advanced, a strange rain and sand storm swept across the desert and settled directly over the Iraqi Tawakalna Republican Guards Division, blinding them to our advancing force. This happened just as our tanks were nearly in range of the Iraqi guns. The storm deprived them of their advantage, effectively blinding them, and enabled our regiment to decisively break the back of this enemy unit. There is no other explanation of the perfect timing of this storm other than God honoring the prayers of his people.

I experienced God’s protection firsthand, while flying into a trap the Iraqi 12th Armored Division laid. Another time I was nearly run over by a vehicle, but saved by a soldier God directed to leave the perimeter for my position just in time to stop the approaching vehicle. I witnessed firsthand many other cases of God’s unseen hand changing history and saving lives. This is what happened when a nation honored God, and humbled itself before him in prayer.

Evil Happens When Men Forget God

Something is wrong in a country where elected national officials can speak publicly with disdain towards those who call the nation to prayer in the midst of a national tragedy. For these same officials to go onto to exploit the deaths of women and children to advance a nefarious political agenda speaks volumes of the moral condition of our land.

How did we get to this point? Alexander Solzhenitsyn, a dissident who suffered the wrath of atheistic Soviet authoritarianism, spoke of what happens to a nation on a path of self-destruction. During his 1983 Templeton Prize lecture, he spoke of why such great calamities befell his Russia:

More than half a century ago, while I was still a child, I recall hearing a number of older people offer the following explanation for the great disasters that had befallen Russia: ‘Men have forgotten God; that’s why all this has happened.’ Since then I have spent well-nigh fifty years working on the history of our Revolution; … [and] if I were asked today to formulate as concisely as possible the main cause of the ruinous Revolution that swallowed up some sixty million of our people, I could not put it more accurately than to repeat: ‘Men have forgotten God; that’s why all this has happened.’

It is disconcerting to see a growing segment of leaders in the United States who have not only forgotten God, but drive any vestige of his presence from public fora. Walking out of moments of silence and rejecting prayer for healing is a sign that a nation is on a perilous path that will only lead to more tragedies against innocent people.

It seems that we have lost our way and need a return to the humility and supplication of prayer that made this nation great. George Washington penned a prayer for the nation that seems particularly acute today. May his prayer start the healing that leads us back to God.

Almighty GOD; we make our earnest prayer that Thou wilt keep the United States in Thy holy protection, that thou wilt incline the hearts of the citizens to cultivate a spirit of subordination and obedience to government; and entertain a brotherly affection and love for one another and for their fellow citizens of the United States of America at large. And finally that Thou wilt most graciously be pleased to dispose us all to do justice, to love mercy and to demean ourselves with that charity, humility and pacific temper of mind which were the characteristics of The Divine Author of our blessed religion, and without whose example in these things we can never hope to be a happy nation. Grant our supplication, we beseech thee, through Jesus Christ Our Lord. Amen.

Repairing Media Mistrust Means Understanding It Didn't Start With Trump,"There was a media ethics summit in Washington DC this week. A bunch of national political reporters and observers, and various “thought leaders” gathered within the high glass walls at NPR headquarters to grapple with media distrust, polarization, the unorthodoxies and attacks of the Trump administration, battling fake news, and slaying partisan bubbles.

I know, I know. The jokes write themselves. Bubbles, glass houses, a Beltway journalist stuttering in consternation when presented with the very idea of journalism ethics before exploding like Bradley Whitford in the culminating scene of “Billy Madison.” I’ve thought of all of them and made some of them there!

Too often media acts like it’s an industry in its heyday, congratulating itself for its toughness and truthiness, while ignoring its own role in its decline, which is ongoing and unhealthy. Yes, this gathering was a bubble of its own— I suggested maybe dinner at Waffle House after, to really break out of our comfort zones—and a lot of the same people talking to each other. But I was there, along with a handful of other right-of-center speakers notably none pro-Trump, and there were some valuable thoughts.

On priorities and real diversity:

.@perrybaconjr: Majority of country is white and I want to hear what they think on race. We need to cover diversity of country better-from Black Lives Matter to Trump supporters. Factchecking POTUS isn't our main job & 20min talking about ""covfefe"" is a waste #PoynterEthicsSummit https://t.co/VRWzDtiyex — Indira Lakshmanan (@Indira_L) December 4, 2017

On monumental missed stories:

.@PostBaron: We should have seen Trump — or someone like him — coming, “before he descended the escalator.” We won’t make that mistake again; reporters are covering every corner of the U.S. #poynterethicssummit — Doris N. Truong (@DorisTruong) December 4, 2017

On the dangers of self-absorption:

“The press should realize that the story isn’t about us… When Jared Kushner goes to CNN and says cut 25 percent of stats, that’s a big deal. When CNN announces that they’re not going to the White House Christmas Party, that’s chicken shit.” — @AlHuntDC #PoynterEthicsSummit — Scott Nover (@ScottNover) December 4, 2017

On the value of self-awareness:

""Trump tweets entirely too much. So do reporters"" — @AlHuntDC. Yes, I tweeted this.#PoynterEthicsSummit — Scott Nover (@ScottNover) December 4, 2017

And on the real costs of mistakes:

“Even small mistakes are used to undercut the entire credibility of the press,"" says @peterbakernyt who admits he had a correction this morning. #PoynterEthicsSummit — Scott Nover (@ScottNover) December 4, 2017

Still, as always happens at such gatherings, I’m left with the concern many aren’t understanding the severity or origin of the problem.

This was the inaugural Poynter Journalism Ethics Conference. This is why it was put on: “Almost a year to the day since President-elect Donald Trump declared the media ‘fake news,’ Poynter is convening leading Washington correspondents and editors for a thought leadership summit on strengthening political journalism and public trust in a polarized era.”

The urgency, the need for the inaugural daylong conference, comes not from falling trust in media, which has been happening for a long time, but mostly from Trump’s attacks on media.

The name of the 2017 Poynter Media Trust Survey, a valuable poll and behavioral study on all these media trends, confirms the raison d’etre for this year’s gathering of grapplers— “You’re Fake News!” And the first paragraph of the executive summary: “During the Trump presidency, the United States has witnessed unprecedented attacks on the press from the highest office in the land. It is essential to understand how these attacks have affected attitudes toward the press.”

We’ve got our correlation and causation mixed up. Trust in media isn’t low because Trump attacks the media. Trump attacks the media because trust in media is low.

This Is a Pre-Trump Trend He’s Capitalizing On

This started long before Trump, as Poynter’s own annual media surveys and Gallup’s polling show clearly. The Poynter survey shows media has seen a slight uptick in trust in the Trump era, overall, but that comes from a rise among Democrats, who have consistently had a better outlook on press coverage than Republicans over decades in Gallup’s poll.

This is a generation’s worth of eroding trust, particularly among conservatives, populists, and those outside the coasts and big cities, finding a voice in Trump. Before that, it found a voice in talk radio and Fox News, whose successes (and own share of narrative-suiting mistakes) were borne of the traditional media’s underserving half of America.

That doesn’t excuse Trump’s nonsense, damaging tweets about pulling broadcast licenses and changing libel laws. Trump doesn’t care much about anyone’s speech if it disagrees with him, and that’s an extremely bad trait in a president making public pronouncements. It doesn’t mean media is without its share of hard-working reporters who put in time all over America, trying to understand those who mistrust them most.

But the survey’s more disturbing findings—44 percent believe the media makes up stories about Trump more than once in a while—haven’t emerged simply because Trump asserts these things. He asserts these things because he’s an opportunist with a target that gives him plenty of opportunities.

Let’s take the weekend before this summit, for instance. On Friday, Brian Ross and ABC reported that President Trump told Gen. Mike Flynn, who had just pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, to contact Russians during the campaign. In fact, the timing was during the transition, which would be noncontroversial for an incoming administration, not collusion by a campaign involved in a conspiracy. Oops. Ross was held accountable after several hours of misfires.

At first the “correction” was merely called a “clarification,” but eventually Ross was suspended for four weeks. The ABC president took Ross off future Trump stories, and reportedly excoriated his staff, seeming to understand the damage the report had done.

Of Course It Didn’t Stop There

In the same 24-hour period, The New York Times reported a story based on transition emails, one of which from K.T. McFarland was excerpted thusly:

On Dec. 29, a transition adviser to Mr. Trump, K. T. McFarland, wrote in an email to a colleague that sanctions announced hours before by the Obama administration in retaliation for Russian election meddling were aimed at discrediting Mr. Trump’s victory. The sanctions could also make it much harder for Mr. Trump to ease tensions with Russia, ‘which has just thrown the U.S.A. election to him,’ she wrote in the emails obtained by The Times.

It is not clear whether Ms. McFarland was saying she believed that the election had in fact been thrown. A White House lawyer said on Friday that she meant only that the Democrats were portraying it that way.

When all of journalism Twitter seized on this rather inflammatory excerpt, the New York Times reporter tweeted the context of the email:

.@McFaul See attached. As we said in the story, it’s no clear that she is saying she believed that election had been thrown. And WH lawyer in story said she was referring to how Dems portrayed it. pic.twitter.com/cjXNpCKIJO — Michael S. Schmidt (@nytmike) December 2, 2017

In the full version, it’s rather clear McFarland is putting that thought into the minds and mouths of Obama officials, not declaring it herself. Here’s where some of the radical transparency summit attendees suggested would have been helpful in the story itself.

In both of these cases, it’s to the credit of the news organization that they addressed the mistakes or mischaracterizations. But in both cases, the mistakes seem suspiciously suited to the version of events that makes the Trump administration and transition look as bad as possible. Their impact was widespread and swift.

In the same two days, Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch faced a distortion of one of his quotes. Joe Scarborough, and all those in journalism who retweeted him, claimed Hatch, who co-authored the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), had said this about the children insured under it: “I have a hard time wanting to spending bilions and billions and trillions of dollars to hep people who won’t help themselves—won’t lift a finger— and expect the federal government to do everything.”

This has almost 10K RTs, many from reporters, and is completely false. Scarborough was hardly alone in lying about what Hatch said, but the lack of a link suggests that the dishonesty is intentional. All of these people owe Hatch an apology. https://t.co/8Rg6c08jMy — AG (@AGHamilton29) December 3, 2017

He was not saying that about CHIP. He was saying it about other programs that he was claiming take money away from CHIP, which is a point with which journalists are welcome to take issue, but is different than what they reported. To his credit, liberal journalist Ezra Klein disseminated a clarification with a video:

https://twitter.com/ezraklein/status/937348381361496064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftownhall.com%2Ftipsheet%2Fguybenson%2F2017%2F12%2F04%2Fmore-fake-news-media-spreads-false-quote-from-gop-senator-n2417527

Again, this mistake seems to run headlong right into the prevailing narrative that the Republican Party is full of a bunch of heartless creeps spinning their monocles on chains made of children’s tears. Scarborough later deleted the tweet.

These mistakes are not Trump’s fault. The fact they all run one direction, and are happily echoed by a profession full of people who too often share the same viewpoints and biases, is not Trump’s fault. It was decades of this that created the deficit in media trust, then Trump showed up to yell about it to a very receptive public.

Consider This Behavior Study About Media Consumption

Part of the behavioral study Poynter paired with the survey this year reflects just that. They ran an experiment with a group of media consumers, all of whom got one of four different types of news stories, to see how their perceptions of media would be affected by those stories.

Respondents in the first condition (media error) read about how CNN had retracted a story linking a Trump associate to the Trump-Russia investigation and that three people involved in the story had left the company as a result. Participants assigned to receive a media attack article were given an article where President Trump attacks coverage of the Russia investigation as ‘fake news.’ Respondents in a Russia investigation condition instead read an article stating that the Senate Intelligence Committee was investigating possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign and transition team. Finally, some respondents read a non-political control article entitled ‘Five sauces for the modern cook.’

Those conducting the experiment expected the “mistake” and “attack” articles to change respondents’ views more than the Russia investigation and cooking control article did. Instead, those who read the Russia investigation article had about the same negative change as those who read the “mistake” and “attack” articles and “a direct attack by the President on the media had limited effects on perceptions of the media or support for press freedom.”

“[T]he mere mention of the Russia investigation in a placebo article that includes no specifics about news coverage prompts the expression of more negative views toward the media,” the summary notes.

Poynter plans to do more research on this, but it certainly suggests feelings about mistakes and bias were baked in before Trump came along, and that mistakes like those above may be baked into reception of even the most neutral Russia article. This effect is more pronounced with Trump supporters and Republican voters, who the survey shows have more negative views of media than other respondents do—the more informed the respondent, the more negative the view. Part of this is tribalism, but a lot of it is track record.

That doesn’t mean Trump can’t exacerbate things. When broken down by Trump-approval, the experiment showed Trump supporters had more negative reactions to media after exposure to the Russia investigation story and an “attack” story.

Notably, they did not react negatively to the “mistake” story, which outlined both CNN’s mistake and its firing of those responsible. It’s very good news for all of us if corrective action and accountability really do matter, even to those who are most skeptical of media. Mistakes will always happen, but the way they’re corrected can help.

I’m glad we’re trying to solve this problem. As a person with a foot in both worlds— traditional media and a conservative community that is deeply suspicious of it, with reason— I’m glad to be part of the discussion. It’s important to the country for the gulf between many American voters and the people who cover them to get smaller. But this problem did not appear in 2015 when a real estate magnate descended an escalator. The descent began decades ago, and until the industry grapples with that, it will continue to descend.

Chelsea Handler Attacks Huckabee Sanders's Appearance Again,"Chelsea Handler, who says she’s a feminist, is doubling down on her attacks on White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders’s physical appearance.

She tweeted a video of comedienne Fortune Feimster dressed in a brown wig and pearls pretending to be the White House press secretary giving a YouTube makeup tutorial. In the video, which is intended to promote Handler’s weekly Netflix show, Feimster pretends to be a coarse woman who says she often gets mistaken for being a man.

“I used to not know what foundation was,” Feimster says. “But our great president was kind enough to take me to a Sephora. He said to the employee: ‘Hey, you see that fellow over here? Make him a woman. I heard that outside a club once.”

At one point, Feimster mocks Sanders’s eye makeup and says you can apply black eye shadow with a paint roller to complete the look.

Handler received backlash last week over calling Sanders a “whore” and mocking Sanders’ eyelashes and makeup. Netflix has announced it will not renew another season of Handler’s show after the second season concludes.

Hours before tweeting out the video mocking the White House spokeswoman, Handler tweeted at Sanders’s father Mike Huckabee that a feminist is “someone who supports other women.”

A feminist @GovMikeHuckabee is someone who supports other women. A feminist is someone who believes the accounts of 15 different women who have similar stories about our President. A feminist doesn’t discount other women. Your daughter is not a feminist. You raised a liar. — Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) December 7, 2017

The hypocrisy is unreal.

It’s completely reasonable for Handler, an outspoken Hillary Clinton supporter and longtime critic of Donald Trump, to criticize the woman who represents the president’s interests to the news media. Being frustrated at Sanders for dodging questions or not providing enough information about issues that Handler cares about are legitimate criticisms. But mocking her eyelashes, the way she wears her makeup, and her Southern accent is petty and embarrassing.

Handler’s actions — angry feminist attacks Republican woman over her lipstick and eyelashes — have become a trope at this point. She’s proving that many high-profile feminists are not above acting like a teenage mean girl whenever another woman disagrees with their point of view, although they spend hours attacking as “sexism” even anodyne comments about women’s appearances. I guess some women are more equal than others to many self-declared feminists like Handler.

"After NYC Bomber, How Can The U.S. Better Identify Domestic Terrorists?","At 7:20 a.m. EST on Monday, the suicide vest worn by 27-year-old Akayed Ullah detonated at a Port Authority bus station in Manhattan. This increased the pile of radical Islamist terror attacks that have hit the United States this year.

While Ullah was badly injured and three other commuters sustained non-life-threatening injuries, countless other rush hour commuters around the scene at the time of detonation were thankfully spared. Former New York Police Department Commissioner Bill Bratton confirmed on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that Ullah had acted in the name of ISIS.

Ullah is a Bangladeshi man who has been in the United States for approximately seven years. He joins the ranks of domestic terrorists radicalized within U.S. borders before carrying out attacks inspired by the Islamic State terrorist group. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo described Ullah as “disgruntled,” and confirmed that Ullah taught himself how to make the deadly “low-tech device” with wires, a pipe bomb, and a battery pack.

While radical Islamic terrorists continue to set their sights on intimidating the western world, the question remains as to what traits domestic terrorists who are radicalized within our borders share and how—if at all—clearer trends are helping identify potential threats.

Building a Profile of Domestic Terrorists to Predict Threats

Former assistant secretary of state Kim Holmes confirms that these traits exist, and that many terrorists radicalized in the United States are young men born overseas and brought over by chain immigration or through the gravely flawed visa lottery. Many more, he says, are the product of Muslim parents born overseas who emigrate to the United States but refuse to assimilate, fostering feelings of alienation and resentment and making them prime targets for radicalization.

“Many of these guys are being recruited online and by radical clerics. Like we saw with Ullah in New York, they don’t even need elaborate support structures,” Holmes says. “These are alienated, frustrated, and violent young men who are looking to belong to something, and that makes them prime targets.”

Holmes said we can look to Europe for data showing the threat of radical Islamic terrorism increases year by year, with a total of 15 plots or attacks in 2014, 38 in 2015, 59 in 2016, and 30 by May of this year. That number is even more daunting when you look at global statistics: between January 2014 and May 2017, there were a grand total of 142 radical Islamic terrorist plots recorded across 15 different countries in Europe alone.

“These guys are looking for ways to justify their violence and find a sense of belonging,” Holmes said. Twenty-eight-year Army Special Forces veteran and former Pentagon top dog Col. Steve Bucci echoed Holmes’ frustration with chain migration: “Look at the case with this guy in New York – he came to the states because his uncle was already here. Chain migration is something that was defined very broadly under the Obama administration. This [Trump] administration hasn’t tightened it up just yet, but they are talking about how to do that effectively.”

Importing Low-Skill People Can Lead to Trouble

Bucci also noted that most “remotely radicalized people” are unemployed or underemployed. “There’s a reason for that; they’re not the sharpest knives in the drawer. Most have frequented radical websites and have picked up the ideology from there. These are people who are wounded and are looking to be associated with something. Isolation, alienation, low income or no income all play a factor here.”

As global terrorism strategies evolve, so too should our defense, security, and intelligence strategies, says Lisa Daftari, an award-winning investigative foreign affairs journalist and editor-in-chief of The Foreign Desk.

“I’ve always deterred people from using phrases like ‘lone wolf terrorism’ or ‘homegrown terrorism’ because these guys are getting information directly from terrorist organizations online,” she says. “We saw this with Ullah: he had been downloading material and had been an online ISS fanboy since 2014. It’s not ‘homegrown terrorism’ when this information is originating in the caliphate.”

Daftari agrees with Holmes and Bucci about the role of economic factors: “Usually, someone who has a job and a life isn’t thinking about strapping a bomb to themselves and blowing something up.”

It’s clear, according to these experts, that Islamic terrorists radicalized within the U.S. do share a host of commonalities. Unassimilated, alienated, underpaid, or unemployed young Muslim men appear to be most vulnerable to radicalization, and chain migration seems to frequently assist these potential terrorists to come to the United States.

But what do we do in the wake of these attacks? Identifying the common threads that bind these terrorists together is an important first step, but does this make potential threats any easier to spot? To put it another way: how do we do a better job of stopping these guys before they kill more innocent people?

Nobody Has a Crystal Ball

Bucci puts it best: “It’s really tough. Larger events, like 9/11 for instance, require a lot of training and a lot of backside support, but our law enforcement, intelligence, and operational capabilities since then have been doing a great job at keeping those guys at bay and finding them before they’re able to carry out something that big. It’s a bit of a tradeoff: do you use manpower and resources to focus on the bad guys going for a huge homerun, which we catch around 99 percent of the time, or these low-level folks who are able to carry out less devastating events but who are harder to keep an eye on?”

Holmes says there are two predominant approaches to domestic terrorism: Urging action, even if we don’t know for sure what will be effective, or urging people to learn to live with the heightened uncertainty as a fact of life.

“Politically correct liberals want us to live with it, with this constant threat of radical terrorism, but the fact is it’s getting worse, so at what point do you change your mind?” he says. “Is it after 143 global attacks? 243 attacks? 343? Liberals’ underlying argument here is that it’s not yet bad enough to do something to stop this, but that implies that working to stop terrorism somehow makes it worse.”

Holmes and Bucci say part of the solution involves a delicate dance between increasing security measures and avoiding infringing on the civil liberties and rights of civilians.

“We should be asking police and law enforcement officials to discuss every crazy idea they come up with regarding how to spot these guys preemptively, because there may be one or two ideas in the bunch that folks will feel comfortable with constitutionally that could give the good guys the edge they need,” Bucci said. Holmes adds that local courts are exercising too much authority in waiving immigration laws.

“The courts are intervening with president Trump’s travel ban on very shady constitutional grounds. We’re at the point where local judges are making foreign policy calls. Where did they get that authority? We sort of glide over that like it’s any other day in America, but that’s not what the courts are for,” Bucci said.

Daftari says education, awareness, and acknowledgement are the most important factors in fixing America’s domestic terrorism problem: “This isn’t going to change whether we have a Republican or a Democrat in office. Until Left, Right, and center view terrorism, national security, and our relationship with foreign policy as a non-partisan issue, all of us are at risk…Radical Islamic terrorists aren’t looking to bomb and kill the alt-right or the progressive left; they’re looking to bomb and kill Americans. We need to be prioritizing safety and security over political correctness.”

Trump Isn’t A Conservative—And That’s A Good Thing,"President Trump is often criticized by detractors on both sides of the political spectrum for his willingness to attack our nation’s institutions. Whether it be the FBI, the NFL, or even CNN, no “nonpartisan” institution has been spared. This has bothered many, especially elite conservatives, who have great respect for these long-standing institutions and believe them to be the bedrock of our republic.

This betrays a fundamental naïveté — that these institutions are somehow above reproach and not subject to the same infectious politicization to which the rest of society has succumbed. That assertion, of course, is ridiculous on its face.

As most conservatives outside the beltway understand, and as President Trump’s voters surely understood in the 2016 election, progressives have successfully captured the vast majority of our nation’s institutions, distorting them to serve their own ends. Although many of these institutions — academia, the media, entertainment, legal and judicial — once stood above politics in serving all Americans, most have now surrendered to progressives’ relentless push to turn every area of civil society into a propaganda arm for their politics.

Prior to Trump, elite conservative leaders generally accommodated to this progressive framework. Because of their reverence for our nation’s institutions and the traditional sense of the appropriateness of the constitutional system, conservatives largely limited their attacks against institutions to the rhetorical and the ideological. The idea of calling the entire legitimacy of specific institutions into question, however, was beyond the pale.

An Anti-Progressive, Not a Conservative

In this respect, Trump is no conservative. This shouldn’t surprise anyone. Trump never claimed to be a student of Russell Kirk or William F. Buckley. But as the president’s actions have shown, he is at war with the progressives who have co-opted American civil society — and is willing to go further than any previous conservative to defeat them.

Instead of “conservative,” the president would be more accurately described as a radical “anti-progressive.” The difference? Conservatives are willing to attack progressives — to a point — but never to the detriment of the institutions they cherish and respect. Playing by these rules, conservatives are doomed to fail as progressives, who do not share the same respect for institutions, capture and dominate every American institution with the full intention of using and abusing them.

But, like the progressives, Trump doesn’t play by these ridiculous rules designed to keep conservatives stuck in a perpetual state of losing — a made-for-CNN version of the undefeated Harlem Globetrotters versus the winless Washington Generals. Trump instead seeks to fight and delegitimize any institution the Left has captured, and rebuild it from the ground up.

It should be stressed, though, that contrary to the contentions of some #NeverTrump conservatives, Trump’s attacks are not intended specifically for our nation’s bedrock institutions themselves. Rather, Trump is attacking the progressive capture of those institutions and the distortion of their true purposes. Let’s take a look at a few examples.

The News Media and Sports

Consider the president’s war on “fake news.” This is perhaps the most prominent example of this attempted delegitimization. Although the president has been frequently accused by elites of both parties of attempting to undermine the freedom of the press, he is not targeting the concept of free press itself but rather the systematic bias that has emerged as a result of progressive media dominance.

For years, groups like the Media Research Center and others have pointed out the mainstream media’s prejudicial treatment of conservative ideas and leaders. However, Trump has been the first president — indeed, the first significant political leader on the Right — to take on the media directly for this bias (and win).

Or consider Trump’s attacks on the NFL, easily America’s most successful and popular sports league. “Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag, and Country?” Trump tweeted back in October amidst the anthem kneeling controversy.

Many conservative pundits speculated that battling the NFL might be too big a fight, even for Trump. Others argued it was beneath the office of the presidency. They were, of course, wrong. Picking a fight with the NFL was exactly the right tactic at exactly the right time, especially as corporate boardrooms across the country were drifting more and more to the Left.

Despite its fan base including a large portion of conservatives, in 2016, the NFL effectively acted as a campaign arm for the radical transgender movement, threatening North Carolina and other states with punitive economic action if they didn’t adopt the leftist social policies. In 2017, the NFL went even further, refusing to discipline (and even implicitly supporting) player protests of the American flag and national anthem.

In this context Trump’s aggression against the NFL ought to be read not as an assault on the league itself but rather on its misguided attempts to prop up the progressive agenda.

The Judicial System

Finally, there are Trump’s attacks on the legal and judicial system, in the form of comments against the FBI, the Department of Justice, and various activist judges who have obstructed his agenda. As I wrote recently at Townhall, recent revelations have called into question the trustworthiness of the FBI and other legal enforcement institutions, suggesting the presence of a “deep state” that has attempted to undermine Trump since the 2016 campaign.

Meanwhile, the judicial system has also increasingly overstepped and abused its authority, inserting itself into the policymaking process that ought to be the purview of the other branches of government. While Trump’s pushback against this has been often crass and imprecise, the concerns he raises are valid. They are not attacks on the legal system itself or judicial independence, as some of his critics argue, but rather on the manipulation of these institutions by progressives attempting to accomplish their own ends.

For decades, progressives have sought to capture America’s institutions to marginalize conservatives and shut down conservatives ideas. Prior to Trump, they were largely successful in doing that. Now they are facing an existential threat to the future of their movement — a Republican president who is willing to get in the mud, break a few rules (that previously only applied to Republicans anyway), and do whatever it takes to win.

Anti-progressivism is taking root in both Trump’s judicial and political appointments and his policies. Progressives intuitively understand this, which is why they feel so compelled to “resist.” Indeed, if they fail to defeat Trump, they may find themselves on the wrong side of history after all.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/02/05/trump-isnt-conservative-thats-good-thing/,2018-02-05
Mueller Has Been Botching Investigations Since The Anthrax Attacks,"Mystery surrounds Robert Mueller and his investigation into Russia and President Trump. Some think he is the ultimate professional, others that he is a Democrat lackey, still others maintain he is working on Trump’s side.

We can see how he works if we look at how Mueller ran his second-most important investigation as FBI Director. In September of 2001, an entity began mailing anthrax through the US Postal system, hitting such prominent targets as NBC and Senator Daschle’s office. The terrorist attacks killed five and left others hospitalized. The world panicked.

Under Mueller’s management, the FBI launched an investigation lasting ten years. They now brag about spending “hundreds of thousands of investigator hours on this case.” Let’s take a closer look at Mueller’s response to understand the context of the investigation — who his people investigated, targeted, and found guilty.

The anthrax letters began just a week after the 9/11 attack. While planning the airplane hijackings, Al-Qaeda had been weaponizing anthrax, setting up a lab in Afghanistan manned by Yazid Sufaat, the same man who housed two of the 9/11 hijackers. Two hijackers later sought medical help due to conditions consistent with infection via anthrax: Al Haznawi went to the emergency room for a skin lesion which he claimed was from “bumping into a suitcase,” and ringleader Mohamed Atta needed medicine for “skin irritation.” A team of bioterrorism experts from Johns Hopkins confirmed that anthrax was the most likely cause of the lesion. Meanwhile, the 9/11 hijackers were also trying to obtain crop-dusting airplanes.

So how did Mueller’s investigative team handle the case?

Mueller issued a statement in October of 2001, while anthrax victims were still dying: the FBI had found “no direct link to organized terrorism.” The Johns Hopkins team of experts was mistaken, the FBI continued, Al Haznawi never had an anthrax infection. The crop-dusting airplanes they needed was possibly for a separate and unrelated anthrax attack.

A few weeks later, the FBI released a remarkable profile of the attacker. FBI experts eschewed analysis of the content of the letters, where it was written in bold block letters, “Death to America, Death to Israel, Allah is Great.” Instead, they focused on a “linguistic analysis,” stating that the letter’s writer was atypical in many respects and not “comfortable or practiced in writing in lower case lettering.” The FBI therefore concluded that it was likely a disgruntled American with bad personal skills.

The investigators hypothesized that the attacker was a lonely American who had wanted to kill people with anthrax for some undefined time period, but then became “mission oriented” following 9/11 and immediately prepared and mailed the deadly spores while pretending to be a Muslim.

Mueller’s FBI honed in on Steven Hatfill as the culprit — a “flag-waving” American, who had served in the Army, then dedicated himself to protecting America from bioterrorist threats by working in the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases.

There was no direct link from Hatfill to the attacks, by the FBI’s own admission, and the bureau never charged Hatfill. The FBI did however spy on, follow, and harass him non-stop for years. The Department of Justice also publicly outed Hatfill as the possible terrorist.

While Hatfill’s dignity and life was being trampled on by America’s secret police, Mueller took a stand. But on a different topic. He made front page news for threatening President Bush he would resign over NSA policy. All while his own team was trampling on the rights of an American in the FBI’s largest-ever investigation.

Hatfill successfully sued the government for its unlawful actions. He won almost $6 million dollars.

After the Hatfill investigation blew up in the FBI’s face, they moved on to Bruce Ivins, another Army researcher who had actually volunteered to help the FBI investigate this case, and had been doing so for years. It wasn’t until five years after the attack that Mueller’s men decided Ivins was a target.

The FBI case against Ivins, once again, was based on circumstantial evidence.

The prosecution stated Ivins purposefully gave a misleading sample of anthrax spore, but Frontline documented this was not true. Ivins was “familiar” with the area from which the anthrax letters were mailed, the FBI said, but Pulitzer Prize winning ProPublica lays out the accepted facts of the case showing it was impossible for Ivins to make the trip to mail the letters.

The spores used in the attacks were a similar type to the laboratory spores where Ivins worked, but that ignored the fact that the anthrax letters had a unique additive — so sophisticated and dangerous a scientist commented, “This is not your mother’s anthrax” — that was likely produced by a nation state or Al-Qaeda.

Ivins was never indicted, just given the Hatfill treatment. His house was raided, and he was threatened with a death sentence, or as his lawyer put it, put under “relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo.” He committed suicide.

One week later, U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Taylor stated Ivins was guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt,” and they were “confident that Dr. Ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks.”

Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy, one of the intended victims of the anthrax terror attacks, did not believe that Ivins was the sole actor. Mueller ordered an independent audit of the FBI’s case by the National Academy of Sciences, then formally closed the case in 2010, sticking with the conclusion that Ivins, and Ivins alone, committed the terror attack. One year later the NAS released their results and confirmed what many scientists had been repeating for years: the FBI’s science and conclusions were not solid.

A former FBI official involved in the investigation sued the FBI, alleging the FBI concealed evidence exculpatory to Ivins.

Mueller made his position known, saying, “I do not apologize for any aspect of this investigation,” and stated that the FBI had made no mistakes.

The investigation was an unmitigated disaster for America. Mueller didn’t go after al-Qaida for the anthrax letters because he couldn’t find a direct link. But then he targeted American citizens without showing a direct link. For his deeds, he had the second longest tenure as FBI Director ever, and was roundly applauded by nearly everyone (except Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert).

Now he’s running the Trump-Russia investigation.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/02/08/robert-mueller-botching-investigations-since-anthrax-attacks/,2018-02-08
ADL Report Of Anti-Semitic 'Surge' Isn't Borne Out By The Facts,"The Anti-Defamation League is reporting a “surge” of anti-Semitism swept the U.S. in 2017, based on their finding that anti-Semitic incidents rose 57 percent last year. But a closer look at the facts doesn’t quite bear out the headlines its generating.

“This is what happens when the President of the United States embraces white supremacists and does not decry racists,” Soledad O’Brien tweeted about the study.

“While the tragedy in Charlottesville highlighted this trend, it was not an aberration,” ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement on the study. “Every single day, white supremacists target members of the Jewish community — holding rallies in public, recruiting on college campuses, attacking journalists on social media, and even targeting young children.”

The available data are certainly far from comforting, but not so easy to interpret as the ADL and others would suggest. For instance, even though the number of incidents the ADL found did rise sharply, the total number of incidents could still be considered small — 1,986 in 2017. In another example, a vast majority of more than a hundred bomb threats were perpetrated by one Jewish man. While instances of anti-Semitism do appear to be on the rise, but the reality isn’t so bad as ADL suggests.

The ADL provides a selected list of 1,215 examples of the incidents on the report’s website. This chart is composed of police reports, media reports and individual reports to the ADL directly. The ADL also watches social media and interviews individuals who report anti-Semitic events on the various platforms, although it is unclear how well these reports are vetted. When sorted, roughly 73 percent of the incidents involved a form of vandalism, with about 60 percent of the incidents involving swastikas. The remaining examples are a wide range of Nazi and anti-Semitic graffiti, anti-Semitic fliers, stickers or literature and various harassment to Jewish organizations including emails, phone calls and social media posts.

Greenblatt addressed the report’s finding of a 94 percent increase in anti-Semitic incidents in K-12 schools. “Certainly, when it comes to kids, they repeat what they hear,” he said in an interview with NPR. “So as we see a decrease in civility and an increase in intolerance, no one should be surprised that that is infecting the environment where our children learn.”

The study states, “Although the largest number of incidents typically occur in public areas, in 2017 K-12 schools surpassed public areas as the locations with the most anti-Semitic incidents, at 457 incidents being reported in K-12 schools …”

About 20 percent of total incidents provided indicated a form of verbal harassment, with a little over half described as “bullying.” Several examples even describe teachers experiencing anti-Semitic attacks from students. About 50 examples describe Holocaust jokes and attacks, with nearly a dozen involving the Nazi salute by students. A half-dozen claim students threw coins or money at a Jewish peer. One Pro-Trump Jewish student was called a “Nazi” by fellow students.

Of the incidents beyond the schoolyard, the majority are anecdotal reports. There are instances of random drivers yelling at Jewish passersby with all manner of anti-Semitic insults. There are assorted crazy people shouting anti-Jewish conspiracy theories outside courthouses or harassing rabbis. A few standing outside holding signs or shouting anti-Semitic things at no one in particular. Multiple examples claim that various individuals in the customer service industry, from cashiers to airplane attendants to taxi drivers attacked Jewish customers with slurs or insults. Many overheard what they considered anti-Semitic conversation, or heard individuals use phrases or comments they felt were offensive but were not directed towards them.

Many examples are as vague as “Jewish woman harassed online” or “Anti-Semitic comment on YouTube” and the ADL reported they received a single rude phone call. One remarkable example states: “A Jewish lawyer was asked by a judge if he had horns under his kippah. The judge also made other anti-Semitic remarks.”

Swastikas have a deeply disturbing impact on Jewish people and therefore whenever one is discovered it sends ripples of panic, outrage and fear throughout Jewish communities. The difficulty is that the symbol is provocative, regardless of whether it’s malicious, a prank or a false report.

An op-ed in a Canada paper cited swastika graffiti as the most common hate crime in Ontario, but quoted the head of the local hate crime unit saying most of them likely weren’t motivated by anti-semitism. “The majority of the 20 swastikas investigated by Hamilton police last year were probably made by young people who drew them because they were easy and provocative rather than because the culprits are anti-Semitic,” the piece reads, attributing the sentiment to Det. Paul Corrigan.

In College Park Maryland in 2017, an African-American man was charged with spray-painting a swastika inside a resident hall at the University of Maryland. Also in 2017, in Upstate New York, a Jewish man was charged after painting the symbol on his own home and reporting it as a hate crime. Another student at Beloit College in Wisconsin was arrested after causing a panic involving the police due to multiple religious and racial slurs painted himself on his own dorm room door.

The ADL found that the majority of the incidents happened in states with large Jewish populations, with the biggest numbers in New York followed by California, Florida, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania and on America’s most liberal college campuses, including Princeton University, Berkley, Georgetown University, and Rutgers University. The Daily Beast reported a shocking level of anti-Semitic hate at Berkley in 2015. Alongside swastikas and anti-Semitic graffiti, they report, “…during the conflict in Gaza this summer, he also came across sidewalk graffiti on campus that exhorted “Death to Israel” and “Kill all the Jews.”

AMCHA, a Jewish organization stated that their 2015 study “…provided for the first time a quantitative account of the prevalence of antisemitic activity at schools most popular with Jewish students… [and] the presence of anti-Zionist student groups, faculty boycotters and anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) activity are each strong predictors of anti-Jewish hostility.” In the first half of 2016, “287 incidents involving either Targeting of Jewish Students for Harm, Antisemitic Expression, BDS Activity, or some combination of these… 64 (57%) of these schools had incidents involving one or more kinds of these activities.” The study also confirmed that anti-Semitic incidents were more common when faculty members engaged in anti-Israel boycotting.

In terms of the “rise of anti-Semitism” on college campuses, unfortunately the ADL only seems concerned with White Supremacy rather than the more common and academically condoned anti-Semitism from the Left.

The most popular schools for Jewish students also happen to coincide with the above mentioned states and schools with the largest number of anti-Semitic incidents. The BDS movement, the Anti-Zionist movement and pro-Palestinian activity are almost exclusively Left-leaning or Islamic driven efforts on college campuses as well. The co-founder of the Women’s March, Tamika D. Mallory attended a remarkably anti-Semitic event by Louis Farrakhan and praised him on social media. Linda Sarsour, another leader in the Women’s movement, openly embraces the above anti-Israel sentiment and has expressed anti-Semitic stereotypes on “Jews in the media.” Often the rhetoric from a White Nationalist or Pro-Palestinian advocate are indistinguishable. The ADL has addressed many anti-Semitic and anti-Israel positions taken by Black Lives Matter leaders and supporters and listed the Nation of Islam and multiple Imams perpetuating anti-Jewish hatred in their study.

The ADL report cites 163 bomb threats to Jewish organizations. Of these threats, 150 were perpetrated by a single Jewish man. An additional eight came from a known copy-cat with a history of violent and unpredictable behavior. The ADL justified including these examples, saying, “ADL included the bomb threats in the total count because, regardless of the motivation of any specific perpetrator, Jewish communities were repeatedly traumatized by these assaults on their institutions and threats to their safety. … These crimes meet the textbook definition of hate crimes: Jewish community institutions were intentionally-selected and targeted — and the bomb threats sparked widespread fear at these institutions, causing evacuations, significant service disruptions, program cancellations, and deep community anxiety.”

There were several disturbing incidents across the country of Jewish cemeteries being desecrated or tombstones knocked over. These appear to be of legitimate malicious intent or done as a cruel prank. Muslim and Christian groups came together with Jewish organizations to rebuild them, and Vice President Mike Pence’s visited the desecrated Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery in University City, Missouri, in February.

Assaults decreased from 36 incidents in 2016 to 19 in 2017. Often these occurred to random Jewish citizens who were verbally and then physically attacked by strangers. People threw rocks at synagogue windows and a Jewish-themed children’s school bus was set on fire. A legally blind, 62-year-old Orthodox Jewish woman was attacked in Brooklyn, New York, by an unknown assailant who shouted obscenities to her and violently pulled off her wig.

There certainly seems to have been a rise in White Nationalism and racist worldviews. Paul Nehlen, a Republican running against House Speaker Paul Ryan, posted a hate list of Jews he accused of publicly attacking him (of which I was included). Nehlen has been a vocally anti-Semitic voice, gathering a disturbingly large following on social media, although he was recently banned from Twitter permanently. But pretending the issue is exclusively in this domain denies a great deal of evidence as to how anti-Jewish bigotry impacts our country.

While the efforts to collect reports of attacks are important, it is equally important that these examples represent real concerns. There is no doubt that in a country of 350 million people there will be crazy, violent, bigoted and irrational individuals. Jews seem particularly easy to target whenever social tensions rise across the country and anti-Semitism has taken on an edgy appeal to those wishing to simply rebel and shock society. The problem however, is when the leading voice in reporting these threats include petty, trivial, absurd and even false or misrepresented claims alongside real instances of hate, it destroys the credibility of all who report.

There are plenty of anti-Semitic experiences throughout the country, from both the Right and the Left, to provide us a clear understanding of the issue without padding the numbers. It is vital that when reporting on student bullying or harassment of Jewish citizens, we dedicate time to understanding and detailing the attacks rather than taking them at face value.

There are important questions to ask.

Are any individuals who report discovering anti-Semitic graffiti vetted before included in the report? Anyone working at any business in the country found to be harassing Jews or using anti-Semitic language is likely to be fired immediately, so where are these instances occurring? How is anti-Semitism occurring at such high levels in public schools without intervention or media reporting? Why are reports of significant events like cemetery desecration held in equal concern with abusive online comments?

Just as anti-Semitic graffiti, literature, posts or fliers can represent a real threat, a prank, or a self-imposed hoax for attention, so too can incidents of harassment or discrimination. But we need real numbers of substantiated events without political bias or selective inclusion of offenders to fully understand the problem. The ADL has a responsibility to give us a true and accurate portrayal of what’s going on. But unfortunately, they appear to only be more interested in perpetuating a political narrative.

Revisiting ‘Battlestar Galactica: The Mini-Series’,"This marks the first of a series of “Battlestar Galactica” recaps. This year is the 15th anniversary of the franchise.

Spoilers ahead.

The 2003 announcement that the 1970s space opera “Battlestar Galactica” was being “reimagined” was met with media skepticism and fan hostility. Yet the mini-series became a critical and popular hit exploring America’s post-9/11 anxieties in the best tradition of science fiction.

The saga begins during peacetime for the Twelve Colonies of Kobol, some 40 years after a lengthy war between humans and the Cylon robots they created as servants. Having reached an armistice, the Cylons vanished, never visiting the remote space station built to maintain diplomatic relations again … until now.

A colonial officer is met by two Centurion robots and a previously unknown humanoid Cylon — a stunning blonde named Six (Tricia Helfer). She kisses the officer as Cylon forces destroy the station.

The story that follows has many twists, but its main plot is simple. The Cylons carry out a catastrophic sneak attack on the colonies. The survivors assemble a rag-tag fleet, arm themselves and escape, headed for a distant planet their scriptures say is home to a 13th tribe — a place called Earth.

Beyond the action and suspense, the mini-series builds its world and tells its tale through its characters, so viewers care when hell comes to breakfast.

The Battlestar Galactica

As Hollywood types would say, the Battlestar Galactica is very much a character in this story. Galactica is essentially an aircraft carrier in space, with cramped quarters and a windowless Combat Information Center instead of a Star Trek-style bridge. It is due to be decommissioned and turned into a museum.

Adm. William Adama (Edward James Olmos) is to be similarly and unhappily retired after Galactica’s farewell ceremony. His old school preparedness renders the ship largely immune from Cylon cyberwarfare, which ultimately will make Adama commander of the fleet.

Lt. Kara “Starbuck” Thrace (Katee Sackhoff), a hotshot Viper fighter pilot, is like a daughter to Adama. During a card game, she punches Adama’s executive officer, Col. Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan). Thrace is thrown in the brig, but is sprung for flight heroics after the Cylon attack. (Reimagining Starbuck as female bothered some, but it is a fresh take on the archetype of the cigar-chomping rogue.)

Though trusted by Adama, Col. Tigh has marital and drinking problems. After the attack, when Galactica is struck by a Cylon missile, he is forced into a life-and-death decision that clears his cobwebs, but does not vanquish his demons.

The Humans And The Cylons

The crew also includes Lt. Sharon “Boomer” Valerii (Grace Park, in another female recasting), who is in a illicit relationship with the ship’s deck chief, Galen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas). Boomer pilots a Raptor (akin to a space combat helicopter) with Lt. Karl “Helo” Agathon (Tahmoh Penikett).

The admiral’s son, Capt. Lee “Apollo” Adama (Jamie Bamber), lands on Galactica for the ceremony. He blames his father for his brother’s death in a Viper accident. He receives an apology of sorts during Adama’s speech decommissioning Galactica. And Starbuck later confesses to Apollo that she bears some responsibility for the family’s tragedy.

Colonial Education Secretary Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell), who is reeling from a breast cancer diagnosis, also attends Galactica’s retirement ceremony. While her ship is returning to the planet Caprica, she learns not only of the Cylon attack, but also that the government has been so decimated that she — 43rd in the line of succession — must be sworn in as president.

On Caprica, celebrity genius and defense consultant Dr. Gaius Baltar (James Callis) discovers his lover — a copy of Six — is one of 12 new hybrid Cylon models. Six used their relationship to infiltrate colonial defense computers, causing most of the military to malfunction as the Cylon attack unfolds. She shields Baltar from a nuclear shockwave after revealing her consciousness will be uploaded to another body.

With mushroom clouds on the horizon, Baltar becomes a refugee aboard Boomer’s Raptor, which landed for repairs after a lopsided loss to Cylon raiders. Indeed, Helo surrenders his seat, believing Baltar’s intellect may be vital to human survival.

Baltar begins having mental conversations with Six, not knowing whether the cause is technological or psychological.

Roslin and Adama seek Baltar’s counsel, particularly after Adama learns of possible infiltration by humanoid Cylons. Baltar’s position allows him to cover up his role in the attack. He even cravenly frames a man named Doral (Matthew Bennett) as part of a bogus claim to have developed a method for detecting Cylons.

As battle losses mount, Adama and Roslin become the top military and civil leaders and fight over strategy. Adama, seeking to counter-attack the Cylons, plans a faster-than-light (FTL) jump to salvage munitions from the Ragnar anchorage station. Roslin orders Adama to assist in rescuing civilian ships instead. Adama does not want to take orders from a “schoolteacher.”

The crisis is deferred when Adama mistakenly believes Roslin’s ship has been destroyed. Adama proceeds to Ragnar, which is enveloped by an electromagnetic cloud that can be fatal to Cylons.

Battle It Out, Or Seek Refuge?

While Galactica collects materiel and defeats a Cylon named Leoben (Callum Keith Rennie) — Roslin assembles a convoy of 60 civilian ships, but must abandon 20 without FTL drives when a Cylon scout discovers their position. The 40 FTL ships join Galactica at Ragnar.

Adama and Roslin clash again. He still wants to fight the Cylons; she wants to seek refuge. After Starbuck reports a large enemy force is lurking outside the cloud, Adama agrees with Roslin.

Galactica attacks the Cylons, but to buy time for the rag-tag fleet to make a long-distance FTL escape. During the battle, Apollo is rescued by Starbuck.

Galactica rejoins the fleet and hosts a memorial service. Only 50,298 human souls survive. Adama inspires those assembled by claiming to know Earth’s location, one of the military’s deepest secrets.

Afterward, Roslin confronts Adama in his quarters, informing him that the prior president knew nothing about Earth’s location.

Adama confesses he invented the claim to give humanity something to live for. Roslin agrees to keep his secret, provided he recognizes her as president, while Adama retains military authority. He shakes her hand, but says only that he will take it under advisement.

Doral, stranded by Tigh at the Ragnar station, is rescued by a team of Cylons, including several Dorals, Leobens, and Sixes. In a final twist, the team is led by a copy of Boomer.

Ratings for the mini-series atypically rose over its two nights, effectively greenlighting Galactica as a series.

And why not? The allusions to Pearl Harbor (The Cylon attack “is no drill”), the assassination of President Kennedy (Roslin’s inauguration recalls President Johnson’s aboard Air Force One), and post-9/11 paranoia (from the idea of an enemy among us to the nuclear holocaust that would have ended most stories in the 20th century) are viscerally compelling. The documentary-style cinematography and suggestions that this is a sister culture add a veneer of reality drawing viewers into the story. The sex is more overt than in most sci-fi. The cast is filled with flawed characters, ripe for further exploration.

Moreover, larger questions remain. What responsibility do we have for the life — or technologies — we create? Can a Cylon have faith in a higher power? How fragile are civil-military relations at a time of emergency? When should we accept a noble lie from our leaders?

With all of this on the table, the search for Earth had to continue.

Bataclan Survivor Jesse Hughes Condemns Gun Control March,"One of the singers who survived the 2015 Bataclan massacre in Paris spoke out Sunday against the students who participated in the gun control march, calling their policy solutions childlike and referring to them as “disgusting vile abusers of the dead” in a lengthy Instagram post.

“As the survivor of a mass shooting I can tell you from first-hand experience that all of you protesting and taking days off from school insult the memory of those who were killed,” Jesse Hughes wrote, “and insult me and every other lover of liberty by your every action.”

Hughes is a member of Eagles of Death Metal, the band that was playing at the Bataclan concert venue when Muslim extremists shot 89 people to death in November of 2015. He posted an anti-gun control cartoon along with the comments, in which a woman tells a man she turned in her gun to stop violence, and he says he chopped off his own dick to stop rape.

Students advocating for strict gun control measures marched in Washington, D.C. on Saturday in response to the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, where a gunman killed 17 students.

“The best thing to do to combat chronic abusers and disregarders of the law(like the law against Murder) is to……..pass another Law!…..Genius!!!…… ” he wrote. “But before we pass this law we’re going to denigrate the memory and curse ourselves by exploiting the death of 16 of our fellow students for a few Facebook likes and some media attention….and look how well civil rights abuses as it concerns firearms helped to protect me and my friends in Paris!!!!! This almost sounds like the plan of like a kid maybe like a high school student….!. Oh wait that’s right…. ”

Here’s the full Instagram post:

Hughes has previously spoken out against gun control as a proper response to mass shootings. “Did your French gun control stop a single person from dying at the Bataclan?” he asked on a French TV network in the wake of the attack. “If anyone can answer yes, I’d like to hear it, because I don’t think so. I think the only thing that stopped it was some of the bravest men that I’ve ever seen in my life charging head-first into the face of death with their firearms.”

He was reportedly turned away from the Sting concert that reopened the Bataclan, after suggesting security at the venue played some role in the attack. He later apologized for making the “baseless” accusation.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/03/26/bataclan-survivor-jesse-hughes-condemns-gun-control-march/,2018-03-26
John Bolton’s Appointment Rattles Muslim Brotherhood Echo Chamber,"The attacks on former ambassador John Bolton following his appointment as National Security Advisor (NSA) have inadvertently served as some of his strongest endorsements.

First there were the hysterical cries of “neocon warmonger!” This would come as news to the NSA-designate, who was never a “liberal mugged by reality” but a self-identified “Goldwater conservative” from the start; explicitly rejects the belief in democracy-building as imperative to achieving America’s national interest under democratic peace theory; and suggests, exaggerating for effect, that following the removal of Saddam Hussein, as soon as practicable he would have told the Iraqis, “You’re on your own. Here’s a copy of the Federalist papers. Good luck.”

Although the “neocon warmonger” moniker is inapt, to say the least, maybe it is not such a bad thing if our enemies buy this line. In fact, this may be part of President Trump’s strategic rationale as a dealmaker for elevating a “peace-through-strength” realist portrayed as a cantankerous cowboy to the top of the National Security Council.

Then followed another narrative: Bolton is not only a real-life Dr. Strangelove, but worse. He is actually an adroit bureaucrat—“crazy and dangerous.” Then-senator Joe Biden, a man prone to malapropism, actually put it best when, in Bolton’s retelling, Biden said of him in 2005: “My problem with you, over the years, has been, you’re too competent. I mean, I would rather you be stupid and not very effective.”

But the truly revelatory attacks concern Bolton’s positions on Islamic supremacism, which reflect an understanding that jihadists pose a mortal threat that must be countered using every element of national power. You know these attacks are meaningful partly because they have been made under cover of a smear campaign.

Opposing Jihadis Isn’t the Same as Opposing Islam

Bolton has been cast as an “Islamophobe” for the thought crime of being a counterjihadist who supports other counterjihadists. The charge of “Islamophobe” is a baseless, intellectually dishonest, and lazy slur. Although it does not deserve to be dignified with a response, it goes without saying that there is nothing to indicate Bolton harbors an irrational fear of Islam, and everything to indicate he holds the very rational belief that we must defeat Islamic supremacists who wish to subject us to their tyrannical rule or destroy us.

“Islamophobe” is being lobbed at Bolton to try and discredit him and ultimately scuttle policies he supports intended to strike at the heart of Islamic supremacism. The “tell” is that the articles raising such accusations frequently cast counterjihadist policy positions themselves as de facto evidence of Islamophobic bigotry.

As the representative par excellence of the position that America should exit the Iran deal, it should come as no surprise that the Iran deal echo chamber in exile has sprung into action in savaging the ambassador with the most outlandish of insinuations. For the Islamophobia campaign, the lesser-recognized and perhaps more insidious Muslim Brotherhood echo chamber has been activated. Bolton is on record as supporting its designation as a terrorist organization, and Brotherhood apologists and true believers cannot abide this.

Either We Work With Terrorists or We Don’t

Recall that the national security and foreign policy establishment has long held that as a “political Islamist” group, the Muslim Brotherhood ought to be treated as a legitimate diplomatic partner. The theory is that we have to choose between violent and seemingly peaceful Islamic supremacists, ignoring the fact that their differences are tactical and strategic, not ideological. They are all still Islamic supremacists.

Most infamously, the Obama administration supported the ascension of Mohamed Morsi, leader of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, to president during the Arab spring, with predictably horrific consequences in particular for the nation’s Christians that persist even in the era of the much-maligned counterjihadist Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

Such disastrously naïve policy pushes ignore that the Muslim Brotherhood is the tip of the Sunni jihadist spear. It’s the ideological fountainhead from which violent jihadist groups from Hamas to al-Qaeda and ISIS spring. The “political” element of the Muslim Brotherhood is, if anything, more pernicious precisely because its adherents do not goose-step, guns in hand, in the public square.

No, the political arm engages in political and ideological warfare, tactfully seeking to impose its will through policy and subterfuge. “Social welfare” activities provide a convenient cover for the group’s ultimate aims. As the Brotherhood put it in its 1991 Explanatory Memorandum on the General Strategic Goal for the Group in North America:

The Ikhwan [Muslim Brothers] must understand that their work in America is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God’s religion is made victorious over all other religions.

On account of the Brotherhood’s nature and activities, it has been designated as a terrorist organization from Egypt to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. A bill first introduced by Sen. Ted Cruz in 2015, calling for the U.S. secretary of state to submit a report to Congress on designating the Brotherhood as a foreign terrorist organization in America, lays out several other reasons the group merits this, including:

The [group’s] explicit calls for violent jihad, with the end goal of imposing Islamic law over all the world of the group’s founder and spiritual leader Hassan al-Banna, and the consistently violent Islamic supremacist content of the Brotherhood’s core membership texts The terrorist efforts of numerous jihadist groups explicitly tied to the Muslim Brotherhood, and the efforts of individual Muslim Brotherhood members designated as terrorists by the U.S. government themselves The litany of terrorist financing cases involving the Muslim Brotherhood, including the…Holy Land Foundation case [the largest terror financing case in U.S. history]…

Do What We Like or Get Smeared as a Bigot

On the campaign trail and in its early days the Trump administration indicated an interest in designating the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization. But within months it shelved these plans. What happened? The Muslim Brotherhood echo chamber deployed.

The Brotherhood undertook an extensive lobbying and information operation designed to dissuade the administration’s plans, reportedly backed by millions of dollars. The U.S. foreign policy establishment quickly proliferated articles and comments in prominent mainstream publications defending the Muslim Brotherhood against charges of being a jihadist group, adding that designated it as such would be impractical and impracticable. Notably, The New York Times went so far as to print an op-ed in the Brotherhood’s defense written by Clinton Foundation-linked Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Gehad el-Haddad.

In the midst of this flurry of articles, it leaked to the media that the CIA and State Department both produced memos against Muslim Brotherhood terrorist designation. Concurrently, counterjihadists throughout the Trump administration were subjected to a barrage of attacks. Many would ultimately be sidelined, though some like Secretary of State-designate Mike Pompeo survived. He, like Bolton, is being attacked as an Islamophobic bigot as well.

Bolton recognized at the time that these events were not random. During a July 2017 interview he noted:

There’s been an amazing campaign. It’s always amazing to me how these stories and op-eds and lines of chatter appear simultaneously, all very well-coordinated…The argument being the Muslim Brotherhood is a complicated organization, not every part of it is devoted to the support of terrorism. Some of them do humanitarian work and so on; a declaration that the entire Brotherhood is a foreign terrorist organization would actually buttress the cause of the jihadis; so, therefore, don’t do anything.

Bolton’s riposte?

Let’s take the notion inherent in that argument as having some validity, that there are pieces of the Muslim Brotherhood that don’t qualify under the statutory definition we have of a foreign terrorist organization…My response to that is, ‘Okay, we need some careful drafting based on the evidence we have now that excludes some affiliates, some components of the Muslim Brotherhood from the designation.’ I’m prepared to live with that, of course, until we get more complete information.

This position is what really draws the ire of the Brotherhood echo chamber. CAIR, the unindicted co-conspirator in the previously mentioned largest terror financing case in U.S. history, published a press release condemning the appointment of “Islamophobe John Bolton” as NSA, citing corroborating articles from such non-biased sources as Think Progress, The Nation, Islamophobia.com, Vox, and Huffington Post.

As I have written previously, CAIR’s Muslim Brotherhood and jihadi ties are numerous and longstanding, involving not only its founders and present leaders to Hamas, but its harboring of apologists for Islamic terrorism, and alleged impeding of counterterrorism efforts.

Bolton’s endorsement of designating the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization illustrates a keen understanding of the size, scope, and nature of the Islamic supremacist threat that the national security and foreign policy establishment lacks. It is a proxy for a worldview that if followed to its logical conclusion would turn our largely futile efforts to beat back jihadists over the last 17 years on their head. This view takes Islamic supremacists at their word in their desire to impose upon us the Sharia-based, totalitarian theopolitical ideology to which they adhere. Hence the pushback.

Applying this worldview would lead to decisions antithetical to the progressive Wilsonian internationalists and political Islamists on myriad issues in the Middle East, including:

Treatment of Israel versus the Arabs

The Iran deal

Iran policy more broadly, including appropriate measures against its proxies in Syria and Lebanon

Qatar’s bellicosity

Turkey’s behavior under Islamic supremacist Erdogan

The Trump administration ought not to concede one inch to those who self-evidently wish to sideline the personnel and stifle the policies that would make its counterjihadist agenda a reality. This specious and slanderous smear campaign reflects all the better on the appointment of Bolton as NSA.

What Is Free Speech In America Gets People Jailed In France,"Many of President Donald Trump’s political opponents believe he is eroding civil rights in the country. Specifically, they see his contentious relationship with reporters and his threats to strengthen libel laws as a direct attack on our freedoms of speech and of the press.

Yet First Amendment rights in the United States are still stronger and better-protected than anywhere else in the world. That is not to say that we should not be sensitive to actual attempts to weaken them, but we should not forget that abuses of speech and press freedoms happen around the world every day, even in liberal democracies like ours, that would never be allowed by even the most Trump-friendly court in America.

Consider this hypothetical scenario: Hillary Clinton, disgusted at the Trump administration’s comparisons of Democrats to Russian totalitarians, tweets out pictures of the torture and murder victims who suffered at the hands of the Vladimir Putin regime. “THIS is Russia,” she writes next to an image of a brutally murdered dissident. Several more follow, with words to the effect that Russia wishes to divide American society against itself. Trump responds by ordering his 2016 opponent’s arrest, and she is charged with the crime of “circulating violent messages that incite terrorism or … seriously harm human dignity and that can be viewed by a minor.”

The president of the United States jailing a political opponent for what she says or publishes would be a source of outrage at home and abroad. Clinton’s supporters would pour into the streets to demand that the charges be dropped. Many Clinton opponents would join them, seeing the charges as an obvious attack on our freedoms as Americans, rights that we believe all men and women enjoy, and that no government has the power to curtail. Trump would be called a tyrant, and rightfully so.

It Didn’t Happen Here

This story has not played out in America, nor will it ever. But it is exactly what happened in France recently as the government of French President Emmanuel Macron ordered the arrest of his opponent from the 2017 presidential election, Marine Le Pen. After journalists drew comparisons between Le Pen’s party, the National Front, and ISIS, Le Pen tweeted out pictures of ISIS victims and pointed out how absurd it was to compare a political party in a democracy with a brutal theocracy that kills or enslaves all who disagree with its medieval strictures.

The Macron government’s response was to order Le Pen’s arrest on March 1. The crime—circulating the images—is punishable by up to three years in prison and a fine of €75,000 euros (about $92,000). That is to say: the president of France wants to jail and fine his political opponent for things she said in public.

To an American, this would be a breathtaking blow to some of the freedoms we hold most dear. In Europe, it is just one more example of the retreat from the values of the Enlightenment that once provided the intellectual backbone to the French Revolution and liberal democracy.

Home of the Free?

Incidents like this make it all the more absurd when organizations like Reporters Without Borders, in publishing their annual ranking of press freedom around the world, place France (#39) higher than the United States (#42). RWB also ranks the United States below Canada (#22), where press freedoms have also been degraded in recent years and free speech is limited by “such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.” Such limits include banning “hate speech,” a term so nebulous that a government can use it to justify censorship in nearly any case.

The freest country, according to RWB, is Norway, which also punishes “hate speech” with up to three years in prison. They define hate speech there as “threatening or insulting anyone, or inciting hatred or persecution of or contempt for anyone because of his or her a) skin color or national or ethnic origin, b) religion or life stance, or c) homosexuality, lifestyle or orientation” (Section 135a here).

Insulting people’s “life stance” will happen in political discourse in a free nation. Judge Roy Moore’s life stance came under attack in his recent attempt at election at the U.S. Senate. President Trump’s lifestyle is under continual attack from his opponents. That’s free speech in America. In Europe, it’s a crime.

Separation of Powers and the First Amendment

Our political system is called unfree by people who hate the president, but they fail to note the ways in which the American Constitution prevents any president from infringing our rights. Trump may, as RWB notes, have “declared the press an ‘enemy of the American people,’” but he has done little to make those words anything more than the complaints of a thin-skinned politician against a press that delights in tweaking his nose.

RWB also notes that the Obama administration “waged a war on whistleblowers who leaked information about its activities, leading to the prosecution of more leakers than any previous administration combined” and the absence of a press shield law. In this, RWB shows that they are less interested in rights than in special privileges for reporters.

This is the wrong way to understand Americans’ rights and our Constitution’s protection of those rights. Freedom of the press is not a class right for journalists. Instead, it is an expansion and amplification of the freedom of speech. Free speech is the right to say what you want; free press is the right to publish those opinions. They are freedoms that belong to all of us. If granting special rights to reporters would help our ranking on RWB’s charts, it would also make us a less equal society, privileging the actions of one profession over those of ordinary people.

In America, that universal right is protected not only by the First Amendment, but by the separation of powers that is essential to our liberty. If Trump sat at the head of a unitary government, one could imagine how the First Amendment might be ignored.

“Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press” sounds absolute, but without pushback from the other co-equal branches of government, a president could easily read in restrictions like those in Canada or Europe. Banning “hate speech” could lead to regulations that severely restrict our rights to speak and publish about political events and ideas.

America’s freedoms are preserved by the independence of Congress and the courts. The president appoints judges, but does not control them, and the continuance in office of previous presidents’ appointees ensures that the bench is never completely dominated by one party. Congress, too, is independent of the president and more susceptible to changes in public opinion. These facts combine to make certain that our liberties are protected.

These freedoms are constantly under attack, even from those they protect daily. Just last month in The New Republic, writer Jeet Heer suggested that government should censor all political news—fake or otherwise—before an election. If that wasn’t shocking enough, Heer conceded that such a task would be logistically difficult, and called on his readers to consider whether “perhaps governments should outright ban Facebook and other platforms ahead of elections,” whether users are posting about politics or not.

It is chilling that a magazine considered a respectable source of center-left opinion would publish an article proposing that the answer to fake news is abolishing all news within a certain timeframe. Heer’s proposal never mentions the First Amendment and only hints that it may violate Americans’ natural rights, showing the idea to be illiterate as well as totalitarian.

We’ve Gotten Close to This In America

With that idea in mind, let’s imagine another hypothetical scenario: a group of people opposed to Hillary Clinton join to produce a film detailing all of the ways in which they think her election would harm the country. They publish this film to spread their political speech far and wide before the election. The government sues them to stop the film’s distribution and silence the criticism, denying that the First Amendment applies to groups like theirs.

Cases like Citizens United show that our government is no different from others in trying to stop political speech it finds distasteful.

Another tale from a European dystopia? Unfortunately, no: these are the facts from right here in America. They describe the facts in Citizens United v. FEC, in which the American government tried to censor a political message. Thankfully, our tale diverges from the European example above because our courts are independent and our Constitution protects free speech and the publication of the speech.

Cases like Citizens United show that our government is no different from others in trying to stop political speech it finds distasteful. It also shows that our country is different in that the government is prevented from doing so.

When free speech advocates speak of political opponents being jailed by power-mad presidents, they are said to be hyperbolic, imagining a slippery slope to an event that will never come to pass. But it came to pass in France this very month, in a democracy some think has greater press freedoms than ours.

Yet Clinton can tweet whatever she wants in America, and Trump will never be able to “lock her up” for it. That is the genius of our Constitution, and the blessing of our Founding Fathers. Le Pen’s indictment should give Americans renewed cause to be thankful for the freedoms we enjoy and to understand how easily they may slip away.

President Trump's Syria Strategy: For One Night Only!,"President Trump has announced American air strikes against the Assad regime in Syria, in partnership with Britain and France. The airstrikes are for one night only, supposedly targeting the “heart” of Syria’s chemical weapons program, though the Department of Defense “acknowledged that the Syrian government most likely retained some ability to again attack its own people with chemical agents.”

Deterring chemical weapons use seems to be the one and only strategic purpose of the strike: “We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents.” So the United States and its allies are just enforcing the Geneva Convention prohibition against chemical weapons.

But this runs us up against the whole “win and go home” dilemma. In wanting to keep our mission in Syria very narrow—so he can authorize a single night of air strikes and declare “mission accomplished“—Trump is avoiding the task of forming the kind of larger, sustained strategy that actually produces results. Sen. Lindsey Graham gets it right on the short-range focus of this current effort.

Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), an influential member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Saturday that the strikes reflected an overt policy decision to be ‘the chemical weapons police’ and no more. ‘The administration does have a strategy—and it’s to withdraw from Syria as quickly as possible,’ he said in a statement, critiquing a hands-off policy that he said would strengthen the hands of Russia and Iran, both key Syrian allies. ‘Ignoring the situation in Syria, simply saying—Not Our Problem—was a losing strategy when President Obama adopted it five years ago. And it’s a losing strategy still today.’

The reason we need a carefully chosen long-term strategy is that we’re trying to undo the consequences of the previous administration’s stubborn neglect of American interests. As President Trump noted, “In 2013, President Putin and his government promised the world that they would guarantee the elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons. Assad’s recent attack—and today’s response—are the direct result of Russia’s failure to keep that promise.”

Actually, it’s worse than that. The 2013 deal Obama made gave Russia a green light to become deeply involved in Syria, which it has done as an ally and sponsor of the brutal regime, giving it a foothold in the Middle East that Russia had never had before, even during the Cold War. Here’s why that’s going to be a problem.

In the days after the attack on Douma, the Syrian government and its Iranian and Russian allies got what they wanted—the rebel group that had been holding out there agreed to be evacuated. After its departure, Syrian and Russian troops arrived. It is unusual for Russian troops to take such a publicly visible role in patrolling Syrian government territory, and their presence can be seen as a warning to Washington against making a retaliatory attack in Douma…. Assad’s regime spent the week letting the world know that, in response to President Trump’s initial tweets about what a military response would entail, it had moved many of its assets to bases where Russian troops and planes are also located. Past attacks have avoided targeting Russians—and resulted in limited damages to facilities that are not as difficult to repair or replace.’

President Obama got us into this mess because he was always seeking an “off-ramp deal,” supposedly a deal designed to let everyone decrease the tensions, but actually a deal designed to allow him to pretend the crisis had passed and go back to ignoring Syria. Until the next crisis. Trump’s airstrike will prove inadequate if it is intended to accomplish the same thing.

A solution to the crisis in Syria—and its many negative effects on the United States, Europe, and the rest of the Middle East—will require a longer engagement than one night only.

"Jordan Peterson’s Right That You Should Be Dangerous, And Here’s How","Recently John Stossel interviewed psychology professor and Internet sensation Jordan Peterson for Reason magazine to talk about the curious phenomenon surrounding his notoriety—that he advocates for seemingly difficult and even unpopular concepts, like responsibility and truth.

“It’s in responsibility that most people find the meaning that sustains them through life. It’s not in happiness. It’s not in impulsive pleasure,” Peterson says. “To adopt the responsibility for your own well-being and to try to put your family together and to try to serve your community and to try to seek for eternal truths and to live them. That’s the sort of thing that can ground you in your life enough so that you can withstand the difficulty of life.”

But the interview takes a turn after Peterson says, “It’s very helpful for people to hear that they should make themselves competent and dangerous and take their proper place in the world.”

Stossel scoffs, “Competent and dangerous? Why dangerous?”

“There’s nothing to you otherwise,” Peterson replies. “If you’re not a formidable force, there’s no morality in your self-control. If you’re incapable of violence, not being violent isn’t a virtue. People who teach martial arts know this full well. If you learn martial arts, you learn to be dangerous, but simultaneously you learn to control it … Life is a very difficult process and you’re not prepared for it unless you have the capacity to be dangerous.”

Stossel counters, “By dangerous that implies I should be ready to threaten someone, to hurt somebody.”

“No, you should be capable of it. But that doesn’t mean you should use it,” Peterson finishes.

As an ethicist and martial arts teacher, I can attest that Peterson is correct. His point regarding virtue is not only logical, it is common sensibly true: we cannot be virtuous in a particular endeavor if we are incapable of actually accomplishing it. The virtue stems from the fact that we are competent first, without which no virtue can be achieved.

Sacred Things Are Worth Defense. That Requires Strength

Pacifists, who believe life is so sacred no violence should ever be visited upon it, contradict themselves if they are unwilling to protect or defend themselves or others from harm. For if life is truly sacred, then it ought to be protected and defended even by violence.

However, let’s not get confused. Some might argue from all this that a criminal who is adept at violence and chooses not to leverage it against others is just as virtuous, then, as the person trained in the use of violence who defends an innocent person from attack. This is wrong. Choosing not to do the wrong thing is not the same as choosing to do the right thing. Virtue is moral excellence, as it reaches toward the good.

This is why Peterson’s point is actually much deeper: being competently dangerous is not enough. We also need to be specifically ethical in its practice, which means justifiable in the use of violence. Peterson’s statement, “But that doesn’t mean you should use it,” is the normative stamp on the doctor’s counsel. This moral feature should not be overlooked or taken for granted and for a simple reason: man is fallen—the human condition is a dark landscape that bears few lights that we must choose to orient ourselves toward.

With Power Comes Responsibility

There is a sexiness associated with being “dangerous” for the same reasons people are attracted to action, mobster, and comic hero archetypes: human beings are primevally obsessed with the application of physical power over themselves and others. When one attains such power and becomes proficient, such as through martial training, there is an inherent obligation, a burden even, to learn to wield it wisely.

Without a prudential sense of when to act and how, there can be great difficulty in determining whether we ought to act at all. This aspect cuts both ways: we might act when we should not, or not act when we should. There may be grave consequences at both ends.

Thus in the training and usage of violence to become a “dangerous” person, the application of justifiable force must be carefully studied and, more importantly, inculcated throughout. Without it, techniques, tactics, and the strategies that rule them are merely hammers looking for heads.

This leads to the question of questions: why ought I act? Competency and dangerousness are both ruled by the deep-seated understanding of motive that most people ignore to their detriment. Here is a true-life example.

A young man went to the aid of a young woman who was being beaten. This fellow thwarted the attack by attacking her attacker. But, unbeknownst to our hero, the aggressor’s friends were not far behind, and when they came upon their comrade receiving a knuckle sandwich, they served up several of their own. Whatever happened to the girl is anyone’s guess.

Question: Did the hero do the right thing? He saw the violence and knew it was wrong. The young lady did not deserve to be beaten by a cretin. Our hero, a trained martial artist, took the bully out. Now, had the violence stopped at that point, perhaps he could’ve tipped his hat and walked into the sunset. But the question remains: Did his “dangerous” action provide him with the best option to stop the violence and prevent more?

We can be dangerous without being ethical. It’s easy, really—far easier than being both, for sure. Even though our hero had approached and ambushed unseen from the rear, he had not acted on the ethical first. If he had, he would have given himself the best opportunity for the outcome he was initially compelled to effect.

Let’s remember why he intervened to begin with—it wasn’t to deliver justice to the villain and tie him up with a note for the cops. He did it to protect a young woman who could not protect herself. Why, then, did he choose a tactic that endeavored the former and neglected the latter?

Once the aggressor’s friends attacked our hero, it created a new issue: now he needed defending. And the young woman was left in the very same predicament our hero found her in to begin with—at the mercy of those who meant her harm.

By unnecessarily attacking the attacker, the hero placed himself, the girl, and even his attackers in potentially deadly harm. Yes, even his attackers: had the hero or someone else been carrying a concealed firearm, it might have turned into a turkey shoot with no turkeys.

Here’s a More Responsible Approach to Attempted Heroism

What should the hero have done? He ought to have placed himself between the young woman and her abuser and separated them. This ethical action is also the best tactical option, as it protects everyone.

By standing up for the girl, he becomes a guardian to protect her from further violence. By not immediately attacking the attacker, our hero protects himself because the attacker isn’t forced into a fight. Fighting becomes a choice the attacker has to make. It also protects the attacker from harm by the hero, as well as harm he may incur to himself as a result of his own poor behavior.

Tactical options, on their own, are devoid of meaning without orientation. Choking out someone from behind is simply a procedure. The technique gains priority and consequence only when aiming toward the good, which in the context of the ethical use of violence is always moral-physical.

This is why I would advocate to define Peterson’s “dangerous” as acting as an honorable and vigilant protector of self and others, including the enemy, if at all possible. Protecting self and others can certainly be challenging, but protecting an enemy is absolutely the most difficult and dangerous thing anyone can attempt. Doing so doesn’t just speak to expert competency, but also to a moral maturity, by a remarkable willingness to self-risk for others, because there is no higher ethical standard in using violence than to subdue an enemy without killing him.

True wisdom results from the ethical use of knowledge. So becoming a competently dangerous person ought to be affixed to a protector-driven physical philosophy so one is able to do the right thing, in the right way, at the right time, for the right reasons.

Why People Don't Save When They Move Closer To Public Transport,"A new academic paper uses long-term panel data on thousands of American households to show that when a household moves closer to public transportation hubs, they do not end up saving much money on transportation. This is an interesting finding to transportation experts, because it has conventionally been assumed that public transportation was more cost effective for most people, and would enable them to reduce car ownership and usage, which saves money in the long run. The finding that savings were in fact extremely small was very surprising.

The study’s methodology is pretty straightforward, and there has been little serious disagreement with its core empirical findings, including its finding that a key predictor of transportation expenses is simply household size, that is, the number of children a family has. Unfortunately, America’s progressive public transit advocates are having a hard time coping with reality.

When I made the very basic point on Twitter that having kids makes owning a minivan more economical than paying for five transit fares every time you want to go somewhere, or that loading up multiple kids onto multiple cargo bikes is kind of a hassle when it’s raining or snowing, public transit advocates on twitter practically swarmed to attack.

The responses used by transit advocates to defend their precious trains can be lumped into four categories: an appeal to Europe, attack on the idea of children, assumption that I’m biased and ignorant, or ridiculous claims about car costs.

An Appeal To Europe

The most common response by far to the anodyne claim that public transit isn’t a good option for getting three kids to three different after-school lessons was to suggest that I was ignorant and had clearly never been to Europe, where public transit usage by large families is common.

Just a few examples:

Quite a few people in the world (e.g., Europe) have kids and no car or one car. Failure of the American imagination here. — Carlos Silva (@CarlosEdibSilva) May 2, 2018

Have you ever been to Europe? — Daniel Almazán (@DaniAlmazan_) May 1, 2018

So that explains why there are no children in Holland… 😂 — Stuart Thiessen (@densifyingWPG) May 1, 2018

This is only because USA cities are designed around cars. Look outside this country to places in Europe or Japan where you would never need a car to raise a family. Here in the USA we have bent over backwards to the automobile and oil industry to force car dependence on everyone — jaxonbattery.eth (@jaxonbattery) May 1, 2018

It’s true: public transit usage is much higher in other countries! In many of them this corresponds to lower fertility rates, but even some countries with larger average family sizes use more public transit. This often corresponds to lower income countries and people, as higher-income people tend to prefer the privacy and flexibility of cars in most countries, but there are plenty of countries where middle-income families with kids make far heavier usage of public transportation than the United States.

It’s also fatuous: progressives appeal to European models across many policy debates, but the key problem with that method is that we are not Europe. What I mean is, we can’t undo a history of suburbanization easily. We can’t arbitrarily terminate the spatially distributed nature of American life. At the end of the day, Americans have created cities and social norms built around using whole metro areas for their shopping, schooling, and entertainment, not just their immediate local neighborhood. European cities built themselves around transit networks for the most part, and before that have dense, Medieval-period cores during a period when the lack of fast, safe transportation encouraged extremely high density.

The United States has no such history; the vast majority of our urban areas reached critical mass during the industrial period, and many became serious cities after the arrival of cars. So while it may be perfectly possible to live a family life without a car in Europe, the United States is not Europe. This helps explain why moving closer to transit didn’t impact family transportation expenses in the study in question: even if the family lives near transit, many of the things they need to get to are not near transit. And as any transportation planner will tell you, transit usage isn’t predicted by the residential population near transit, but by the destination amenities near transit.

An Attack On Breeders

Some progressives responded in a way that is particularly abhorrent but to which I’m accustomed by now: an attack on children.

https://twitter.com/arkanciscan/status/991381669352357888

Breaking News alert: Man with kids mad he can’t park in DC https://t.co/7SLmHLdnV9 — Eric James (@ericjam_) May 1, 2018

https://twitter.com/ronmarans/status/991139128862543872

It’s garden-variety progressivism by now to assert that any challenge families face is their own fault for having kids, and society owes them nothing for that. Apparently, the continuation of the species is of no interest to the general public. Of course, many people also responded, even fairly progressive people, that they agreed on the kids point: putting a carseat in an Uber or a rental car is a pain, waiting around on the platform for a train with a crying baby is less than ideal, and paying the fare for several kids gets expensive.

But again, this argument reflects a basic detachment from reality among public transit advocates. In response to a point that transit isn’t a great solution for the majority of Americans who live in households with children, their response was, “Have fewer children.” As if the ruling factor in having children should be transportation convenience. The reality is that transportation exists, quite literally, as a means to an end, not an end itself.

The ideal transportation system would be one that Americans never need to think about when making life decisions, whether about childbearing or otherwise. The reality is that car ownership allows families more flexibility about future choices, and especially neighborhood of residence, which matters a lot for families with children, especially as they reach schooling ages. Rather than recognize that this issue is real and imposes a limit on how much proximity to transit can do to reduce car usage, advocates would rather adopt the nonsense view that riding public transit should be an end in itself, and a reason not to have kids.

An Ignorant Hillbilly

Being from Kentucky, I’m accustomed to stereotypes about ignorance and backwardness. They’re commonplace from people on both sides of the aisle. But public transit advocates are particularly prone to crass stereotyping of rural people, or people they perceive to be less urbane than they are. As just two of the milder and more polite examples demonstrate:

*when you live in Kentucky and don’t have neighborhood / curbside car rental apps https://t.co/GVi6mZF0A5 — Wally Nowinski (@Nowooski) May 1, 2018

The trouble here is that these people assume that I must be some angry suburban dad peeved he can’t park wherever he wants when he homes into town for a monthly errand. The reality is quite different. I live in a dense-mixed use neighborhood in the urban core of DC, less than 100 yards from a metro stop. I take the metro to work every day, except days where I use the municipal bikeshare instead or, sometimes in the summer, my wife drops me off on her way to work. We have no kids, and I’ve lived in dense urban cores for literally the entirety of my adult life (although I grew up in a rural area).

Identity politics have infected the entire political spectrum. Right-wing identity politics are just as prominent and poisonous as left-wing identity politics. But in this particular case, progressive advocates simply cannot conceive of the possibility that a person would simultaneously have the identity “urban transit-user” but also the belief “car-culture is unlikely to change and not a horrible thing.” Similar to the numerous advocates who responded assuming that my defending family choices meant I must have kids (sadly, I do not yet have any little Stones rolling around anywhere), these advocates see the argument and jump to the assumption that it signals identity.

Much of the political debate about public transit, as so many issues are, isn’t about public transit at all. It’s about identity. It’s about the kind of people progressives wish Americans were: less individuated, more heavily using overt government services, keeping their lives centered in a few dense networks, never longing for the open road. As such, they can’t imagine why somebody would keep a car when they move nearer transit; being near transit should change that person’s material interests, which should change their political identity, which should change their beliefs and values. The idea that beliefs and values might come first, and be independent of material interests, is positively anathema to many modern politicos of all stripes.

An Appeal To Cost

Numerous transit advocates responded to me by simply denying the whole thrust of the empirical study I cited. This is ironic given the favorite progressive claim that “reality has a liberal bias.” This denial came in the form of asserting that car ownership has enormous costs, and the implication that the study must, somehow, some way, be wrong. Many of the people arguing this admitted that they had not actually read the study in question when I asked them.

Here’s the reality: car usage does have many hidden costs to individuals and society. I have done the math for my own family on transportation options, and it shows how the math can work out. For my wife and I to both use cars to commute, our total transportation costs over five years would be about $126,000. About two-thirds of this cost is not actual money that came out of our bank account, but time wasted commuting to work. I consider 100 percent of time commuting to be wasted, and I value time wasted at each of our individual wage rates. Since both my wife and I also do self-employed hourly work on the side which actually has a higher hourly rate than our main jobs, this is probably an underestimate of time costs. I incorporate depreciation of the vehicles, resale value, maintenance costs, gasoline for plausible mileage, etc.

But for both my wife and I to use public transportation to get to work would still cost us $121,000 over 5 years. We would need to use Ubers or car rentals for many trips and vacations, which gets very expensive very fast, and my wife’s commute time would be longer (mine is actually shorter if I commute by public transit). In other words, we can reduce our total economic cost of transportation by approximately 4 percent by switching to full transit usage, at the expense of a lot of lost time.

But there’s another option. My wife can drive to work, and I can metro, each of us taking the fastest commuting option, and maintaining the flexibility of a car. This option lowers our costs to about $113,000 over 5 years, which is a more significant decline. And since we have no kids, this works just fine. This is, in fact, what my wife and I actually do. We got rid of the second car years ago after doing precisely this calculation. But the catch is that the total number of miles driven only falls a bit: I estimate dropping the second car only reduced our miles driven by about 10 percent.

Most social costs of cars, like environmental impacts or safety risks due to collisions, are not associated with car ownership, but with vehicle miles driven. Getting rid of our second car only reduced our miles driven a small amount, much smaller than public transit advocates might want. And when we have multiple kids, a second car may become necessary, especially if urban rents become too expensive for us to remain in the city center.

In other words: getting rid of one car didn’t have the big social impacts advocates want, and getting rid of the second car would raise the economic cost of transportation for us by a decent amount, about 12 percent.

The Real Argument For Public Transit

There is a good argument for public transit that public transit advocates rarely make, possibly because it just isn’t the language they speak. That argument is the exact same argument made in favor of cars: freedom. Having more transportation options gives people more freedom. It means if the car breaks down, they aren’t totally dependent on taxis. It means if they can’t afford a car, they can get to work. It means families can have more flexibility and don’t have to shuttle their middle school kids to activities all the time; they can just hop on the train. A mixed-mode transportation system that makes it easy, affordable, and convenient to drive, bike, walk, train, bus, or park all over the city is almost certainly the best path forward given American social and urban norms as they exist today. As it is, we have massively overbuilt our highways, even as our rail networks have so few destination points that they are of little use even to people who need or want to use them.

Plus, the reality is, drivers don’t pay their fair share of transportation costs. Data from the Census of State and Local Government Finances suggests that combined revenues from gas taxes, license fees, tolls, and parking only covers about 53 percent of state and local spending on highways and parking. The Federal budget runs an additional transportation deficit on top of that. Covering the state and local gap would take a toll of about $0.03 per mile driven. For reference, the cost of gasoline is about $0.05 to $0.17 per mile, depending on gas prices and car, so the toll would be a substantial increase in the cost of driving. But practically speaking, taxpayers, including nondrivers, are footing the bill to provide socialized roads to parasitic drivers not paying their fair share.

Of course, the same is true of public transportation! While I was unable to find comprehensive statistics on public transit revenues and expenditures across the whole country, in most individual jurisdictions, public transportation is not self-supporting, but requires outlays by the government funded by taxpayers.

Any reasonable conservative should be opposed to this socialized transportation. People should pay their own way whether on roads or trains. And especially given the tens of thousands of deaths caused by cars every year, it’s reasonable to suggest that society could, on the margin, benefit somewhat fewer miles of driving.

But when transit advocates make overwrought claims unsupported by evidence, like the idea that adding transit will greatly reduce total transportation expenditures for individuals, they fail to advance their cause. And when they double down on the ideological preference for trains over cars, making it a debate over fundamental values about children, liberty, and national culture, they obliterate any hope of being persuasive.

The United States is a car culture that is likely to remain for generations to come. Adding better transit options and ensuring all transportation modes are priced fairly is good and reasonable, and conservatives should get on board that liberty-enhancing market-oriented train. But let’s avoid making the transit debate about identity politics, okay?

What We Know About China's Suspected Laser Attack On U.S. Soldiers,"Apparently Chinese soldiers attacked U.S. Air Force pilots in Africa with laser beams last week. U.S. pilots in Djibouti said lasers struck their plane while in flight, The Wall Street Journal reported. They also said the lasers appeared to be coming from the direction of a nearby Chinese military base.

The two airmen reported symptoms of dizziness and seeing rings. (Pointing lasers at aircraft is extremely dangerous. It can temporarily blind pilots, and in the United States it’s a federal offense.) While the pilots are expected to make a full recovery, the incident raises questions about how far the United States will allow China to push it without pushing back.

But first let’s back up. What’s everyone doing in Djibouti, a tiny country in eastern Africa? America has a base in Djibouti because of its proximity to Yemen, a terrorist incubator. The 4,000 U.S. troops stationed there are tasked with conducting counterterrorism operations in the region.

What about China? Well, that’s a little more opaque. China opened its Djibouti base last August, claiming that its purpose is to help with anti-piracy patrols and other peacekeeping missions. It’s supposedly a logistics base, but here’s the thing: China doesn’t have foreign military bases anywhere in the world — except in Djibouti, eight miles from the U.S. base.

Now, back to those lasers. First, the lasers that were used to target U.S. planes are military-grade. They aren’t just some high-tech toy bought off the shelf. This was a military weapon that was being used on U.S. Air Force pilots.

Second, last week’s incident isn’t the first time this kind of thing has happened. According to The Wall Street Journal’s military sources, there have been three previous incidents involving military-grade lasers in Djibouti in the last few weeks. There was also a fourth incident that didn’t involve lasers, but no further details were given. But last week’s laser attack was the only one that caused the U.S. government to lodge a formal diplomatic complaint with the Chinese government.

So why didn’t America say something sooner? A spokeswoman for the Defense Department said that a complaint was lodged this time because of the injuries sustained by the airmen and because the latest attack indicates that the frequency of these incidents is on the rise.

But it also sounds like that fact has been known for some time. The U.S. military was concerned enough about the risk of these laser attacks that it had previously warned pilots to use caution when flying over certain parts of Djibouti. And while such laser attacks have only just started popping up in that country, apparently they’ve been an ongoing problem in the area of Asia under U.S. Pacific Command.

It’s easy to say that what happened last week was just some Chinese military personnel goofing around, maybe showing off with one of China’s new gadgets, and that this was utterly unsanctioned by Chinese military leadership. But this would be extremely naïve.

For one thing, it would be an awfully big coincidence if Chinese military personnel in several locations at different times over the past few months all had the same idea: “Let’s laser some U.S. planes.” It wouldn’t be at all surprising if this harassment was sanctioned by senior Chinese government and military officials. Chinese leaders aren’t fools, either. They know how to harass, but stop “just short of war,” as one Asia expert told The Wall Street Journal.

What’s more, these laser attacks are also wholly consistent with Chinese actions over the past several years while Beijing has been angling to rival the U.S. as a global superpower.

Let’s just take a few examples. First, China has been aggressively building up its military. For the past two decades, Beijing’s military budget increases have been in the double digits. In an assessment of China’s military power last year, the Pentagon noted that China is likely to build more military outposts like the one in Djibouti, perhaps in Pakistan. Last month, China held its largest ever naval drills, not surprisingly, in the South China Sea. This was followed quickly with live-fire exercises in the Straits of Taiwan.

Second, as most China-watchers are well aware, Beijing has been building up and militarizing man-made islands in the South China Sea in recent years. These actions present obvious problems to navigation in some of the world’s busiest international shipping lanes. Just last week, it was revealed that the Chinese had installed anti-ship cruise missiles as well as surface-to-air missiles on three of the disputed Spratly islands in the region.

Third, while most American media and political elites are hyper-focused on Russian interference and intelligence operations, few are keyed in on the massive intelligence and cyber espionage operations that China has been conducting against America in recent years, most notoriously the 2015 Office of Personnel Management hack that resulted in the theft of personal data belonging to nearly 80 million Americans.

Fourth, China has long backed the Kim Jong Un’s rogue regime in North Korea, and has proven less then helpful in curbing that country’s nuclear ambitions over the past few decades. Beijing likes to feign interest in doing so, but has ultimately not proven to be a reliable partner in that effort.

There are plenty of other indications of growing Chinese aspirations for regional hegemony and global leadership, including its Silk Road initiative, an increasingly aggressive posture vis-à-vis Taiwan, and its surging investment in Africa.

What this latest incident of Chinese laser tag shows is that China is testing its boundaries, not unlike a two-year-old. It is inching its way across various boundaries to see just what, exactly, it can get away with before America lays down the law, hoping to expand its power and position, not just in China’s sphere of influence in near-Asia, but also on the global stage. If it moves too fast, it might scare the international community. So it’s inching its way toward superpower status, testing the waters as it goes along.

And China will keep progressing apace if it’s not checked by the U.S. and its allies. The Trump administration has showed more willingness to push back than its predecessor, for example by increasing Freedom of Navigation Operations in the South China Sea. But the administration could do more. In reaction to the recent military installations in the Spratly Islands, the White House said, “We’ve raised concerns directly with the Chinese about this and there will be near-term and long-term consequences.” Great. But what, exactly, will that mean?

China takes a long view of history. Its willing to be patient and keep inching forward slowly, inuring the world to its growing dominance. If the U.S. doesn’t do something more to push back against Chinese aggression, we can expect to see more of the kind of harassment those U.S. airmen endured last week. And we can expect it to slowly ramp up.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/05/08/know-chinas-suspected-laser-attack-u-s-soldiers-last-week/,2018-05-08
More Proof The Left Really Does Want To Abolish Legal Gun Ownership,"Supporters of increased gun control claim they want “common sense gun laws.” Yet, the left’s goal is and always has been the abolition of legal gun ownership by civilians.

The left knows that they cannot ban civilian firearms ownership directly. The U.S. Supreme Court put an end to that fantasy with the D.C. v. Heller decision in 2008. That ruling acknowledged that the Second Amendment was an individual right. It struck down the District of Columbia’s handgun ban. But that did not put an end to the left’s desire to abolish civilian gun ownership.

The left and gun control advocates usually hide behind the rhetoric of “common sense gun laws.” Take this statement from the Hollywood-backed “No Rifle Association.” We apologize in advance for any sudden drop in IQ points it may cause.

But the mask sometimes slips off and their real goal of gun confiscation comes out in the open.

The most high-profile case of this is former U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens’s call to repeal the Second Amendment. Stevens claims that it will make it much easier to enact gun control laws without. “It would eliminate the only legal rule that protects sellers of firearms in the United States — unlike every other market in the world.” wrote Stevens.

But Stevens is not the only one who has called for the repeal of the Second Amendment. Several writers on both the left and the center-right have called for it as well. But repealing the Second Amendment only enjoys the support of 20 percent of the population.

The left and its anti-gun allies are following Saul Alinsky’s “Rules for Radicals” and attacking gun ownership. They’re launching a legal, cultural, and economic war on guns.

Anti-gunners can only legally attack gun ownership to a point. But that is not stopping them from doing what they can. Make no mistake, the left’s goal is not just to reduce gun violence, but to end legal gun ownership. The goal of their legislation is to make gun ownership as inconvenient as possible for gun owners.

Many gun control advocates claim they do not support confiscating any guns already in circulation. But Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell ripped that mask off with an op-ed in USA Today. Swalwell calls for the forced buyback of all “assault weapons.” If you don’t comply with the buyback, Swalwell thinks you should be prosecuted.

But the anti-gunners won’t just stop at “assault weapons.” They don’t want you to own any type of firearm. That’s why they’re proposing restrictions on everything from ammunition to even how you can buy a gun.

One of the left’s big talking points is “guns should be licensed and insured like cars.” They have proposed making liability insurance mandatory for gun owners. But what happens when gun owners cannot legally get gun liability insurance? New York State just shut down NRA Carry Guard, a liability insurance program for gun owners. Gun control advocates have also been targeting Carry Guard’s underwriters with boycotts.

The next front of the anti-gun movement’s attack on gun ownership is ammunition. Every gun fires it so it makes sense for gun banners to heavily restrict it. Democrats are pushing for background checks on all ammunition purchases. The problem with them is that the costs of background checks, anywhere from $20 to $40, can make a trip to the range a costly venture. It would price working class gun owners out of exercising a constitutional right.

But the anti-gun movement is not stopping there. They want to zone gun stores out of existence. Alameda County, California, has an ordinance banning gun stores within 500 feet of areas that include a residentially zoned district. There’s one catch to that ordinance, not a single lot in the county meets that rule.

Gun rights groups have sued the county, but the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with county. They have appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court sides with Alameda County, local and county governments could virtually outlaw the sale of firearms.

The anti-gun movement isn’t content to just attack gun ownership legally. Following Alinsky’s rule of “freezing, polarizing, and personalizing the target,” they’re also using the culture to attack gun owners. Gun owners are portrayed as racist and violent. Young people who learn how to shoot are interrogated by police and even suspended from school. Parents who teach their kids gun safety are demonized on social media.

A scene from the @NRA annual meeting in Dallas. 5,790 American children receive medical treatment each year for a gun-related injury; 21% of those injuries are unintentional. About 1,300 children die annually from a gun-related injury in the US. #NRAAM pic.twitter.com/6ONVhlJytG — Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) May 6, 2018

Finally, there is the economic war on guns. Gun manufacturers and their investors are being targeted for boycotts. YouTube has banned many gun videos on its platform.

New York State officials are pressuring banks and insurers to sever all ties with the gun industry. Already, Bank of America and Citigroup have announced new restrictions on gun dealers. Credit card companies are exploring ways to track gun purchases. Finally, several gun dealers, such as Dick’s Sporting Goods and Wal-Mart have announced plans to raise the minimum age to buy a gun to 21.

These attacks add up to the goal of abolishing legal civilian gun ownership. It is a way to achieve that goal without that pesky Second Amendment getting in the way.

Gun owners and supporters of the human right to self-defense need to fight back. Not only should any gun control measures be defeated, but also we need to go on the offense in the cultural and economic spheres. We should be highlighting examples of legal self-defense with firearms. Gun owners should celebrate things such as National Shooting Sports Month in August and encourage non-shooters to try shooting. We should work to eliminate some of the fear guns cause in society.

There has to be a price paid for businesses and others who work against gun ownership. The expulsion of Dick’s Sporting Goods from the National Shooting Sports Foundation for its advocacy of gun control is a good start. The refusal of Hornaday to sell ammunition to New York government agencies is also another positive step.

The power of the boycott has to be used by gun owners and gun rights supporters. There is already a boycott list of anti-gun companies that should be followed by anyone who believes in self-defense. It’s time to use our enemies’ tactics against them.

The 'Jawbreaker' Comics Outrage Cycle Is A Ginned Up Controversy,"Over the past couple weeks, comics has been rocked by a wave of social media firestorms. At the center of it is Diversity & Comics, a YouTuber and aspiring comics writer whose real name is Richard Meyer. His IndieGogo project “Jawbreakers” was funded to the tune of $294,000 at press time, a high figure for a comic written by a guy mostly known for ranting on YouTube about books he hates and getting into Twitter fights with the comics crowd. Neither is usually considered a writer’s proving ground. But here we are.

His book was picked up, briefly, by the publisher Antarctic Press for post-IndieGoGo distribution. The crowdfunded to published pipeline is not uncommon in comics. “Five Ghosts,” a fun adventure comic by Frank Barbiere and Chris Mooneyham, had its first issue crowdfunded before it was published by Image Comics.

Shortly after Antarctic’s announcement that they would publish “Jawbreakers,” the comics Twitter-verse, professional social circles, and retailer circles exploded. Boycotts of Antarctic were announced, retailers said they’d refuse to order the book, and many a comics industry pro wrote diatribes on Twitter and Facebook deriding the decision. Former Daredevil writer Mark Waid went so far as to call Antarctic Press to urge them to pull “Jawbreakers” from their lineup.

Antarctic Press pulled the book in more time than it took ESPN to cancel “Barstool Van Talk,” but less time than Anthony Scaramucci was White House press secretary.

To many outside the industry, this looks like banning conservatives from the public square, but that’s taking a very simplistic and borderline-false view of it. Antarctic Press currently publishes a number of over-the-top Donald Trump-supporting books. “Jawbreakers” colorist Brett Smith’s graphic novel adaptation of “Clinton Cash” was a massive success and carried in many comic shops, for example. No boycott was announced, no publishers were contacted, and today you can still walk into many comic shops and find a copy.

Meyer’s personal attacks on various creators, taste-makers, editors, and other people in the comics industry made the release of “Jawbreakers” by any publisher a guaranteed controversy starter. Let me explain.

Richard Meyer Is a Professional Troll

Meyer’s popularity needs to be traced back to his start, which began with Twitter spats with different creators, editors, and publishers, generally calling out shoddy work in books or whenever they’d post something political on Twitter. One quote his detractors regularly cite came from him calling an editor a “c-m dumpster” (original word modified).

His Twitter account generally launched attacks on Marvel editors, many of which are young women. While, yes, they were overwhelmingly progressives, attacking them online isn’t particularly a way to gain friends in the industry.

Focusing on female editors is also an offshoot of the “fake geek girl” phenomenon, where many a “fan” complains women in an industry are infiltrating to destroy it and don’t actually care or like the thing they’re working on. It’s hard to put any stock into this idea.

In comics, there is very little mainstream notability. This is not Olivia Munn hosting “Attack of the Show!” Your average Marvel editor is making somewhere around $50,000 a year and has to work in Manhattan. For those who have never lived or worked in Manhattan, a $50,000 salary is essentially the poverty line. This is not a sacrifice worth making if you really don’t care, especially when you add in the harassment from fans who hate you or simply the books you’re making.

Later Meyer formed a YouTube channel based on his Twitter, where he’d discuss books, many of which he’d cherry-picked to incite outrage clicks. He’d take on a book like “Squirrel Girl,” complaining about it being written for a 12-year-old girl with a smattering of politically correct platitudes thrown in. But a book like that isn’t exactly highbrow critical thought, it’s a book written and made for tweens (or tween-brained adults), not dudes who’ve been reading superhero comics since the ‘80s.

Meyer’s channel has clearly created revenues for him, as it boasts a large subscriber number and a huge view count. His YouTube videos tend to further push attacks on individual creators who are overwhelmingly progressives online. In some cases it extends to their written work, as with Nick Spencer, in other cases not so much. For example, Ed Brubaker is clearly liberal but his books with Sean Phillips are all quality work regardless of what end of the political spectrum you land on.

The Progressivism of Comics Has Other Influences

Comics does indeed have a progressive bend, and it’s gotten worse over the past five years, as it has across the American political spectrum. Its influence on comics is worth looking at outside shouting at creators, and much of it is wrapped up in the rise of Image Comics and creator-owned properties.

Prior to Marvel jumping into throwing overt politics into its books, they had a wealth of great writers at the helm. Brubaker was responsible for “Winter Soldier,” the book the movie was based on. Matt Fraction had runs on Hawkeye and Iron Fist that are fantastic reads. Jonathan Hickman did some wild work with the Avengers and Fantastic Four, beyond having some of the more notable runs in Marvel comics since the ’90s.

They all also no longer work at Marvel. All three are producing books at Image Comics, a publisher where they, and the fantastic artists they collaborate with, own their creations. They have the freedom to tell whatever stories they want. Marvel makes no such offer.

Plenty of other talented individuals who worked at Marvel also packed up for greener pastures. Since then, Marvel has had a very hard time filling those shoes and much of the writing is done by either a few over-worked individuals (Charles Soule must be writing something like 10 monthly books) or the occasional headline-grab name like Ta-Neishi Coates.

None of these headline-grabbers come from comics, so their books tend to not be created with comics in mind. Thus they end up being talky treatises turned into narrative. Many writers fall onto using Twitter headlines of the day as muse, which is how a discussion about the pros and cons of brunch ends up in an X-Men book.

This Is People Deliberately Profiting from Rage

Mainstream superhero books have also not been immune to the overt nature of political commentary in entertainment today, leading to the general critique of “there’s too much politics in books today,” which really means “writers are not as good at making meaning inherent to story.” Claremont’s X-Men books, Frank Miller’s Daredevil, and Batman all had undercurrents of political awareness and commentary. Most good art does have something to say about society or people at large, they just usually didn’t do it directly in dialogue. Writing today is much more upfront with what it wants you to think.

The comics Twitter crowd is just as unhealthy and vile a community as any other Twitter crowd.

Comics’ critical community has never been a place where money can be made, so writers tend to give out fluff reviews of books they like. (My book got good reviews, and my art was objectively atrocious in it.) That’s because it’s much easier to write a quick nice review than to be critical of something, especially when being critical could land you in hot water with a certain loud cabal of people on Twitter.

The comics Twitter crowd is just as unhealthy and vile a community as any other Twitter crowd. It rewards outrage and denies taste or nuance. Many a comics controversy comes from a loud feign of outrage on Twitter—Howard Chaykin’s “Divided States of America” proved its title when the cover featured a man hung with a racist or homophobic slur written on him. The outrage proved the point Chaykin was making with the series—however, he anticipated the outrage to come from the Right, when it actually came from the Left.

The whole episode harkens back to Meyer complaining about “Squirrel Girl,” a book he would never have picked up other than to complain about it, just like those complaining about Chaykin’s cover had zero intention of buying his book. Accusations of “wrong think” coming from both sides of the aisle ends in a zero-sum game.

Diversity & Comics and the people he attacks have a ton in common. Both want the other’s products and preferences removed from the marketplace, and neither will stop until the whole thing is burned down.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/05/18/jawbreakers-comics-outrage-ginned-controversy-book-banners/,2018-05-18
Obama Says ‘I Didn’t Have Scandals.’ So What Are All These?,"At a Las Vegas tech conference last week, former president Barack Obama told an audience that his presidency had been scandal-free. “I didn’t have scandals, which seems like it shouldn’t be something you brag about,” Obama joked, according to Newsweek. We hear this talking point quite often from Democrats.

Now, perhaps the president didn’t experience the fallout from a scandal, which is very different from never having been involved in one. For this confusion, Obama can thank the political media.

Why does it matter now? For one thing, historical revisionism shouldn’t go unchallenged. Democrats are running to retake power, and many of them were participants or accomplices in numerous corrosive scandals that have been airbrushed.

The other reason, of course, is that when we start to juxtapose the mythically idyllic Obama presidency with the tumultuous reign of Trump, we’re reminded that many journalists largely abdicated their responsibilities for eight years — which has a lot to do with the situation we find ourselves in today.

It’s not about Obama’s brazen lying about Obamacare or even recurrent abuse of power. I’m talking about supposed non-scandals like “Operation Fast and Furious,” a program devised by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) that put around 2,000 weapons into the hands of narco-traffickers (and an Islamic terrorist), leading to the murder of hundreds of Mexicans and at least one American, border agent Brian Terry.

The body count could have been higher when a homegrown extremist who, with another assailant, attempted to murder the audience at a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Garland, Texas with one of the Fast and Furious weapons. An off-duty police officer killed both of the attackers.

Despite the incompetence, absurdity, recklessness, and fatalities of the program, the entire affair never really received scandal-like attention. No one lost his job. There will almost certainly be a tweet from Trump this week that political media will afford more attention than a story in which an American border agent was murdered with the gun Obama’s ATF provided.

Not even when the administration refused to cooperate with congressional investigators was it handled like a scandal. Not even when a federal judge rejected Obama’s assertion of executive privilege in efforts to deny Congress files relating to the gun-walking operation was it treated as a scandal. Not even when we learned that Obama attorney general Eric Holder misled Congress about when he was made aware of the program did it rise to the importance of a Trump tweet. Holder became the first sitting attorney general in American history to be held in contempt of Congress — a vote that included 17 Democrats — and Obama still never paid a political price.

As it was, the Obama administration persistently ignored courts and oversight, breaking norms because it was allowed to do so. The president was articulate, friendly, and progressive. He might have executed an American citizen without a trial (not a scandal!), but his contempt for the process could be forgiven.

It’s why Obama could secretly send planes filled with cash to pay a ransom to a terror state (using money earmarked for terror victims) and most reporters and analysts would regurgitate the justification they heard in the echo chamber. One Politico reporter might drop a 14,000-word heavily sourced investigative piece (two officials involved in the program went on the record) detailing how the Obama administration undermined law enforcement efforts to shut down an international drug-trafficking ring run by the terror group Hezbollah operating in the United States, and most major news organizations never even mentioned the piece.

When they did, it was usually to give space to former Obama officials to smear the reporter.

It needn’t be said, but if the names were changed to Trump and Russia, the president would be accused of sedition. But by any conceivable journalistic standard, it’s a scandal that should have triggered widespread coverage. So when we see mass indignation over every single hyperbolic statement from the current president, it’s a bit difficult to buy the outrage.

An Obama official famously bragged to The New York Times Magazine that he could rely on the ignorance, inexperience, and partisan dispositions of reporters to convey administration talking points to help push through preferred policy. Rather than being hurt or embarrassed by this kind of accusation of unprofessionalism, many reporters are more reliant on the same people than ever before.

Yet many professionals who supposedly deplore the authoritarian nature of an administration that doesn’t answer CNN’s questions were generally quiet when Obama spied on reporters. The Obama DOJ spied on the Associated Press in an attempt to crack down on internal leaks. The DOJ tapped around 20 different phone lines—including cell phone and home lines—that snared at least 100 staffers who worked for the outlet. The Justice Department spied on Fox News reporter James Rosen in 2010, collecting his telephone records, looking at his personal emails and tracking his movements.

Color me skeptical, but somehow I doubt similar Trump efforts would be framed as a “rare peek into a Justice Department leak probe,” as if we were pulling the curtains back on a fashion show. It would be, rightly, depicted as an assault on democracy.

Then again, spying was also never really given the scandal treatment during the Obama years. As Obama’s CIA director, John Brennan became aware of an operation of illegal spying of a legislative branch staffer over torture files and misled the media about it. Did the president know? Shrug. The story hardly made a dent. Likewise, Obama’s director of national intelligence, James Clapper, admitted he misled Congress about spying on American citizens. No scandal.

Today both these people are on TV chumming around with serious journalists who allow them to continue to make reckless, unsubstantiated political statements all the time. It isn’t Chuck Todd on “Meet the Press” who asks Clapper tough questions, it’s Meghan McCain on “The View.”

There was unprecedented politicization of the government under Obama — most of it, I imagine, excused for being part of a good cause. The NLRB. The Justice Department. The IRS. The Office of Special Counsel, which reviews whistleblower allegations, found that IRS employees urged callers to vote for Obama, wore pro-Obama swag, and campaigned for Democrats in conversations with taxpayers — all of it illegal.

But far more seriously, IRS leadership, specifically Lois Lerner, aggressively targeted conservative groups before elections. The IRS admitted as much in an apology letter. Lerner was held in contempt by Congress for refusing to comply with investigators’ demands. She never answered questions for this genuine attack on democracy.

What difference does it make, right? While the extent of the incompetence and negligence during the Benghazi terror attack on September 11, 2012 is still unknown, what we do know is that Obama and a number of high-ranking officials in his administration lied about what happened for partisan reasons. Susan Rice went on a number of national television shows and claimed that Benghazi was a “spontaneous reaction” to “hateful and offensive video,” even when she knew it was a sophisticated and pre-planned terror attack. (Rice is now on the Netflix board, and Obama is a very rich man. At some point you’ve made enough money, but that time is not yet. )

Although they knew it was a complex terror attack, Obama and Hillary Clinton cut television ads to placate radicals in Islamic nations by repeating the claim that a video perpetuated the attack, and apologizing for American free speech — a scandal in itself.

Worse, however, the administration detained the man who produced the offensively amateurish “Innocence of Muslims,” and initially charged him with lying about his role in the production of the video. This was a blatant attack on free expression. Yet most of the mainstream press continued to take the administration’s word for it and report that the video was the cause of the “protests.”

Democrats in general just kept pretending that every accusation was merely a partisan, racist plot to undermine the president. Whether it was bypassing process and oversight to fund cronyistic green projects that enriched political and ideological allies with tax dollars, or the Secret Service’s embarrassing debauchery or Hillary Clinton’s attempts to circumvent transparency or, perhaps the most immoral, the Veterans Affairs’ negligence regarding veterans, they would never admit they faced a scandal.

This double standard in coverage makes today’s often sanctimonious reactions to Trump a bit difficult to take. Many reporters will snarkily point out that most of the stories critics latch onto have been reported on or broken by mainstream journalists. It’s true. There are plenty of good journalists out there. But it’s the intensity of the coverage and the framing of the events that is evidence of ideologically motivated coverage. And every time Obama or his allies claim that they were scandal-free, millions of Americans are reminded of the obsequiousness of most media coverage.

Revisiting Battlestar Galactica: ‘Final Cut’ And ‘Flight Of The Phoenix’,"This is the twelfth in a series of “Battlestar Galactica” recaps. This year marks the 15th anniversary of the franchise. Read the last piece, “Revisiting Battlestar Galactica: ‘The Farm’ And ‘Home,’” here.

Spoilers ahead.

If prior episodes have played as space opera, political thriller, or even dark comedy, “Final Cut” is a near-mockumentary about life aboard Galactica. “Flight of the Phoenix” borrows a title and theme from the 1965 film about people surviving after a plane crash in the Sahara by building a new plane from the wreckage.

When the episode aired, some critics thought the portrait of the crew redundant. In hindsight, after the major plot closure in “Home,” these episodes remind the audience that the fleet is in the grip of a rolling psychological crisis.

Moreover, the balanced, largely positive portrayal of military life is notable in light of the reputation the show would develop (as we will see) for metaphorically critiquing President George W. Bush’s post-9/11 war policies. The journalist protesting too much over the implicit charge of lacking patriotism is similarly striking.

‘Final Cut’

Journalist D’Anna Biers (Lucy Lawless) is preparing a report critical of the “Gideon massacre” (shown in “Resistance“) when soldiers escort her and her crew to Colonial One. Pres. Roslin and Cdr. Adama offer Biers the opportunity to make an “all-access” documentary about life on Galactica.

Biers films hijinx in the Viper pilots’ duty quarters. Apollo reprimands Kat for clownishly playing to the camera and escorts Biers from the premises.

Biers interviews CPO2 Dualla about her decision to join the military, which caused a split in her family that was not healed before the Cylon attack on the colonies. The cameras catch a heated dispute between Kat, deck chief Tyrol, and Starbuck about maintenance on the hangar deck. Pvt. Kelso (Kevan Kase) defends his role in the Gideon massacre and blames Tigh for sending the military to force resupplies in the first instance.

Biers begins an interview with Tigh by plying him with a drink. Tigh quickly concludes she wants to blame him for the Gideon massacre and storms out. Adama later apologizes to Biers for Tigh. She asks why Tigh was never charged; he cites the necessities of war and notes that no one truly escapes their command decisions.

Helo tells Biers that military training is meant on some level to dehumanize them, but that emotions never completely drop out. He then visits Boomer in her cell, only to discover she is bleeding due to some complication of her pregnancy.

Kat has a breakdown during an attempted landing, the result of taking stimulants to keep up with the demanding rotation for Viper pilots. In the sick bay, Kat tells Biers this is the first time she has been ashamed for disappointing her comrades. Biers also tapes Dr. Cottle treating Boomer (whose presence has been kept largely secret after Cally shot the original). Adama demands that tape from Biers, who intentionally hands him the wrong cassette.

Galactica comes under Cylon attack, which Biers shoots from the CIC, while her crew tapes the action on the hangar deck. Biers observes Galactica’s effectiveness under pressure. When Biers previews her documentary (which uses the 1978 Battlestar Galactica theme music), Tigh thinks it is a hatchet job, but Adama thinks it is a great “warts and all” portrait. Roslin agrees and orders it shown to the entire fleet.

The report is also viewed by Cylons on Caprica, including the tape of Boomer. They marvel at human resilience and are thrilled Boomer and her child survive. One of the hybrid Cylons is revealed to be a copy of Biers.

‘Flight Of The Phoenix’

The episode begins with the mustering of a major Cylon force preparing to attack the rag-tag fleet.

Following a check-up, Dr. Cottle tells Roslin she may have less than a month to live.

Tyrol is depressed. After declaring a Viper scrap, he opts out of the party marking Cally’s release from the brig. He and Helo (who is being ostracized for his relationship with the Boomer copy) get into a discussion of Boomer that evolves into a fight.

Meanwhile, Galactica’s environmental systems begin malfunctioning. The ship also transmits a burst signal which may attract the Cylons. Lt. Gaeta and Baltar conclude the Cylon virus attack (in “Scattered” and “Valley of Darkness”) may have been more successful than they thought. This causes a blow-up between Gaeta and Tigh, another sign of deteriorating morale.

An exception is Tyrol’s decision to make an off-duty project of building a new type of fighter from scrap and scrounged parts. Although met by skepticism from his crew, the effort gains volunteers, including Starbuck and Dualla (who helps configure the communications system). Even Tigh, who initially suggested to Adama that the project be shut down, sees the lift in morale and works a deal to have engines brought aboard in return for some of Tyrol’s moonshine.

(Another exception is the possible chemistry developing between Apollo and Dualla during combat training, even if their moment is interrupted by Billy.)

Meanwhile, Adama has Helo show Galactica’s computer code to Boomer. She confirms the Cylon virus has been learning the ship’s systems and has mutated to a point where it will soon be able to take over. Gaeta and Baltar recommend a cold reboot of Galactica from an uninfected backup. This will create a window where the ship is a sitting duck. Adama concludes he trusts Boomer insofar as she wants to live; he has her brought to the CIC.

A massive force of Cylon Raiders and Heavy Raiders is detected; Vipers are launched to meet the threat. Boomer opens her wrist with a knife and splices one of the ships fiberoptic cables into her arm. She directs the cold restart of Galactica while transmitting the virus to the Cylon fleet, disabling their ships and making them easy targets for the Vipers.

Tyrol completes his project when Helo suggests using carbon composite for its skin — which has the added benefit of making it stealthy, as proven in Starbuck’s test flight. At a christening ceremony, Roslin calls the “Blackbird” an “act of faith” in their future. And she is visibly moved upon learning the crew has named the ship “Laura.”

Revisiting Battlestar Galactica: ‘Resurrection Ship’ (Parts 1 and 2),"This is the fourteenth in a series of “Battlestar Galactica” recaps. This year marks the 15th anniversary of the franchise. Read the last piece, “Revisiting Battlestar Galactica: ‘Pegasus'” here.

Spoilers ahead.

In this gripping two-parter, the show’s writers again take inspiration from American war history and war movies. Apollo’s observation of the battle seems inspired by George H. Gay Jr.’s observation of the Battle of Midway. Adama’s choice of “downfall” as a codeword may allude to the name of the D-Day invasion of Normandy or the cult German film about Hitler’s last days.

The maneuvering of Cain and Adama seems to have a flavor of Crimson Tide (which inspired the ultimately far different ‘Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down‘). And there is a “blanket party”-style beating in the tradition of Full Metal Jacket. Oddly, despite naming the antagonist Cain, there does not seem to be much from The Caine Mutiny in this story. Cain has none of the cowardice of a Capt. Queeg; she is brutal and her more humane moments reveal only that she is not a caricature.

Part 1

At the end of ‘Pegasus,’ Cain launched her ready Vipers to meet the ships Adama assigned to rescue Helo and Tyrol (sentenced to death by Cain for killing Lt. Thorne, who was about to rape Boomer). Yet neither Cain nor Adama give permission for their fighters to fire.

The crisis is diffused by Starbuck’s return in the Blackbird, which she commandeered to conduct reconnaissance of the mystery Cylon ship Cain wants to attack. Cain initially mistakes the stealthy Blackbird for a Cylon ship, but is transfixed when Starbuck begins sending photos to the monitor screens in the CIC on the Pegasus. Closeups reveal the ship appears to be holding hybrid Cylons in some sort of storage.

Cain orders a mutual stand down. She and Adama agree to meet on Colonial One. Pres. Roslin attempts to mediate the dispute, but it quickly becomes apparent that neither Cain nor Adama are budging. Roslin manages to broker a truce until after the attack on the Cylon fleet.

Returning to Pegasus, Cain tries to cultivate Starbuck by promoting her to CAG for showing initiative. Cain also tells Starbuck she wants to not only authorize Starbuck’s rescue mission to Caprica (as Starbuck promised Anders), but also force the Cylons off the planet.

Meanwhile, Roslin advises Adama he will have to kill Cain before she kills him. Roslin reminds Adama he has sworn to protect the civilians and it is plain Cain has no interest in the rag-tag fleet. Adama replies that he is not an assassin.

Upon returning to Galactica, Adama apologizes to Boomer for the attempted rape, which cracked one of her ribs, but did not harm her unborn child.

On Pegasus, Baltar tells his mental Six he no longer misses his lake house (where they meet in his head). Cain gives Baltar a copy of the recon photos to show the Six held onboard. Baltar has to dissuade Cain from kicking the captive Six. After Cain leaves, the Six begs Baltar for death.

Adama asks Cally about the Pegasus deck crew, and learns their chief, Laird, was a civilian from a ship called the Cilla. Tigh then questions Fisk about the Cilla. Tigh learns the Pegasus stripped civilian ships for parts, including FTL drives, effectively marooning them. Cain also ordered the transfer of valuable civilians – including Laird – to Pegasus. The families of those who resisted transfer were shot.

Baltar brings the captive Six fresh clothes. She still wants to die. When Baltar responds that her consciousness would be transferred to a new body, Six replies: “not if you destroy that ship.” Baltar then informs Cain and Starbuck that the mystery Cylon craft is a Resurrection Ship; they wonder if making the Cylons mortal might cause them to stop pursuing humans.

Starbuck conducts a briefing on the mission, during which the Blackbird will attack the Resurrection Ship’s FTL drives (carrying a nuke would be discovered by the Cylons). Adama asks for Starbuck to remain for questions after the briefing.

Adama then asks Starbuck to kill Cain upon his codeword by wireless after the attack; she agrees. Meanwhile, Cain orders her exec, Fisk, to observe the attack from Galactica’s CIC and – upon her codeword by wireless – kill Adama afterward.

Part 2

On Pegasus, Starbuck recruits Apollo to help kill Cain. Apollo returns to Galactica, where he questions Adama about the plot. Adama tells him it was Roslin’s recommendation.

Helo and Tyrol are beaten in their cell until Fisk intervenes and berates (but does not arrest) the attackers.

The joint attack begins. Apollo uses the Blackbird to destroy the Resurrection Ship’s FTL drives. During his escape, the Blackbird is struck and Apollo is forced to eject. He quickly realizes his suit was punctured and is losing oxygen. Experiencing hypoxia, he ignores radio calls from Dualla as he watches the larger battle in the distance.

The Resurrection Ship is destroyed and the Cylon fleet flees. Apollo is rescued by a Raptor.

After the attack, Cain contacts Adama by wireless and — at Adama’s request, puts Starbuck on the call. Adama, using code, calls off the assassination of Cain. Adama notes it is not enough to survive; humanity must be worthy of it (a theme of his retirement speech in the mini-series, of which he was reminded by Boomer).

At Cain’s request, Adama puts Fisk on the call. She too calls off her planned killing of Adama.

Meanwhile, the captive Six disables a guard who enters her cell with Baltar. She hands the guard’s gun to Baltar and again begs him to kill her. He returns the gun to her and says he cannot because he loves her.

Cain returns to her quarters, disarms herself and begins to disrobe. Six, who has been waiting, kills Cain. Fisk assumes command of the Pegasus at Cain’s funeral.

Starbuck visits Apollo in the sick bay. Apollo apologizes for not being there to back up Starbuck and confesses he did not want to come back from the battle. This conversation is overheard by Dualla.

Adama is frustrated that the Six escaped from Pegasus, but is heartened when Roslin promotes him to Admiral now that he commands two Battlestars.

"Aggressive Deportations Are Bad, But They’re Not Ethnic Cleansing","With the Trump administration carrying out an aggressive immigration policy, restricting access to asylum for Central Americans, militarizing the southwest border, and deporting numerous foreign citizens, some progressives have accused the administration of “a mild form of ethnic cleansing.” It’s worth tackling this accusation because, while it’s false, explaining why the administration’s policy is not a form of ethnic cleansing helps clarify exactly the ways in which these policies are nonetheless stupid and wrong.

It’s useful to start with some definitions. What do we mean when we say “ethnic cleansing”? It turns out to be a very young phrase. Merriam-Webster says the first known usage of the word in its current sense was in 1991, but Google Ngram suggests the late 1980s may be the actual origin.

Regardless, the source of the phrase is not very much in dispute: it was used to refer to the appalling humanitarian situation in the successor states to the former Yugoslavia during the 1990s. The United Nations even suggests it may simply be a translation of the Croation “etničko čišćenje.” Thus, the phrase has its origin in the disasters of the Balkans in the 1990s.

How We’ve Used ‘Ethnic Cleansing’ Ever Since

The “Yugoslav Wars” claimed about 140,000 lives, and led to about 4 million people being displaced from their homes: about 1 in 5 of the population of Yugoslavia in 1987. International criminal tribunals handed down guilty verdicts for genocide against several Serbian leaders, who massacred 8,000 residents of the city of Srebrenica.

Since the 1990s, “ethnic cleansing” has been used to refer to other historic events, such as the expulsion of Turks and Greeks from Greece and Turkey, respectively, after World War I, or the expulsion of ethnic Germans from their former East Prussian territories in present-day Poland. Likewise, Iraq’s sectarian violence has sometimes been described as “ethnic cleansing.” There’s a long list of potential cases you can peruse on Wikipedia.

But there’s a problem. According to the United Nations, “As ethnic cleansing has not been recognized as an independent crime under international law, there is no precise definition of this concept or the exact acts to be qualified as ethnic cleansing.” Calling something “ethnic cleansing,” then, is vague and debatable.

On the other hand, one UN report described ethnic cleansing as, “a purposeful policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove by violent and terror-inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas.”

They also, cheerily, gave a list of acts that could be described as ethnic cleansing: “murder, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, extrajudicial executions, rape and sexual assaults, severe physical injury to civilians, confinement of civilian population in ghetto areas, forcible removal, displacement and deportation of civilian population, deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas, use of civilians as human shields, destruction of property, robbery of personal property, attacks on hospitals, medical personnel, and locations with the Red Cross/Red Crescent emblem, among others.”

Synthesizing these, we can conclude that ethnic cleansing generally has three criteria:

It is forcible, accompanied by violence or the threat of violence. It is targeted at a specific ethnic or religious group or groups. It aims to remove that group or groups from a given territory.

With these definitions in mind, we can ask whether current U.S. policy constitutes ethnic cleansing.

Is Current U.S. Policy ‘Forcible’?

All government policies are “forcible” to some extent; the law is force, and the threat of force. So in this case, when we think about the “forcibleness” of a given policy, we really want to know if it is unusually forcible. Are there elevated levels of violence or application of force compared to what is normal for the given action? Serving an eviction notice carries with it the force of law, but usually landlords do not show up in Kevlar vests with automatic weapons. Arresting people is always coercive, but sometimes more or less so.

We can draw a few bright lines. For example: is a policy normally undertaken by civilian or military authorities, and has that changed? Normally, immigration policy is undertaken by civilian authorities. But President Trump has militarized the border, deploying the National Guard, a clear escalation of “forcibleness.”

Another common trend in ethnic cleansing is the presence of private paramilitary bodies. Unregulated private soldiers are a common feature of ethnic conflicts, as seen in Syria, Iraq, Bosnia, and elsewhere. These groups often undertake particularly brutal killings in foreign theaters of war, and their presence as part of a government’s strategy for enforcement is a concerning sign with respect to the degree of force being used. Check that box too: American paramilitaries are indeed present and active along the border.

We can also just go through the list given above, and check which ones are happening:

Murder (by state security forces): Not to the best of my knowledge.

Torture: Again, no reports that I’ve seen indicate the use of torture.

Arbitrary Arrest and Detention: Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Holding citizens hostage for years on end, forcing people to carry proof of citizenship (do you carry your passport when you go out?), invading private property without warrants: the evidence of arbitrary arrest and detention is widespread and obvious.

Extrajudicial Executions: Nope.

Rape and Sexual Assaults: Yes.

Severe Physical Injury to Civilians: Nope.

Confinement to Ghettoes: Kind of. Detained people are, well, detained. And the numbers of detainees are large. But on the other hand, there is no evident effort to confine the general non-detained population to specific residential areas, so this is mostly no.

Forcible Removal: Yes; that’s what deportation is.

Deliberate Military Attacks: No.

Use of Civilians as Human Shields: No.

Destruction of Property: Probably somewhere, but generally no.

Robbery of Personal Property: A thousand times YES! Civil asset forfeiture is highway robbery! However, this doesn’t specifically target immigrants; it’s just an awful part of U.S. law.

Attacks on Medical Facilities: No.

So overall, on the question of violence, a few bright lines are crossed, like arbitrary detention, militarization, and the use of paramilitary groups. On the other hand, we are not seeing whole Hispanic towns rounded up and detained, there’s no campaign of ghettoization, and we aren’t seeing a campaign of murders, rapes, and maimings against Hispanics.

A violent anti-Hispanic campaign was waged in the early 1900s, so it’s not like such a campaign is totally beyond imagining. But the reality is that for all that mass deportations may be unfairly deporting folks who’ve been working here legally and productively for 20 years who accidentally went 25 miles over the speed limit (and that sort of thing is happening), none of the obvious “Yes, this is violent ethnic cleansing” alarm bells are going off.

What we can say, however, is that everything is in order to do it. The military and paramilitary forces are there. The civilian authorities are ramping up their level of aggression. They are building the camps.

Right now, there’s no ethnic cleansing. But it’s not crazy to think the pieces on the board are aligning in such a way that the violence necessary for genuine ethnic cleansing could soon become possible. The government is becoming less afraid of enacting violence on the people who live in its territory, and more open about deploying the military on our own soil, using them to harass and intimidate not only foreign citizens, but U.S. citizens as well.

Is a Specific Ethnic or Religious Group Being Targeted?

It is undoubtedly the case that a specific group is being targeted: immigrants, particularly foreign citizens who have entered the United States illegally. The question is whether targeting immigrants counts as ethnic cleansing. The answer is no.

Deportees are disproportionately Hispanic, but that’s because immigrants, particularly illegal immigrants, are disproportionately Hispanic. It’s easy to find cases of Arab, African, even European detainees in the current wave. We aren’t seeing a campaign against a specific ethnic or religious group, but against a legal class, which includes members of virtually all racial or ethnic groups.

We aren’t seeing a campaign against a specific ethnic or religious group, but against a legal class, which includes members of virtually all racial or ethnic groups.

It’s an absurdly broad legal class, of course. Deporting long-time legal residents for decades-old misdemeanors is stupid. These people got here legally, use welfare far less than natives, work hard, and contribute to society. It makes sense to deport foreign citizens who have recently committed crimes, especially felonies, and it makes sense to deport foreign citizens who aren’t here legally at all. But folks with decades of clean records and legal residence? Is it really of any benefit to the country to deport these people?

Of course, in the process of rounding up these people, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has to check the citizenship of many people, including many citizens. In other words, because you can’t just look at someone and know whether he or she is a citizen, identifying non-citizens forces ICE to treat many citizens like they are possibly non-citizens. As ICE’s treatment of non-citizens gets more and more aggressive, that means citizens are exposed to more and more tyrannical state-sponsored harassment.

The group the Trump administration has targeted isn’t an ethnic or religious group, so these policies aren’t ethnic cleansing. But “Not quite ethnic cleansing” is a very low bar. Holding citizens in jail for no reason and authorizing federal agents to harass citizens are bad outcomes of a ridiculously over-broad mandate.

Does the Administration Aim to Remove an Ethnic Group?

It’s hard to know intent. Certainly there may be people within the administration who would like to see a 100 percent white America. On the other hand, none of the policies currently being used have a snowball’s chance in hell of creating a “white America,” and that should be obvious to anybody who has taken more than five seconds to review the available demographic data.

None of the policies currently being used have a snowball’s chance in hell of creating a ‘white America.’

Even if every non-citizen in America were deported, non-Hispanic whites would still only be about 65 percent of the population, versus about 62 percent of the population today, according to the 2012-2016 American Community Survey. In other words, the maximum plausible effect of an extremely aggressive deportation policy is that the minority population shrinks by maybe 2 to 5 percentage points of the whole. Current policies, even carried out to an implausible extreme, never get remotely close to a serious demographic re-writing of America.

If this is ethnic cleansing, then it’s got to be one of the most pitiful and half-hearted ethnic cleansing campaigns ever. Without any policy that actually targets minorities as a class, it’s difficult to argue that the aim is the removal of whole ethnic groups.

Asserting that targeting non-citizens implicitly targets a racial or ethnic group is misguided and a bit insulting since, for example, about 80 percent of Hispanics are U.S. citizens, and some have families who have lived in the American southwest for longer than the United States has even been an independent country. Targeting non-citizens still leaves overwhelming majorities of virtually every racial or ethnic group outside of the targeted class.

Now, the fact that these policies are woefully ineffective at changing America’s demographic mix isn’t really a compelling defense of them, but it does suggest that the administration’s aim really actually is not the material elimination of an ethnic group.

Just Because It’s Awful Doesn’t Make It Ethnic Cleansing

It’s fine to deport illegal immigrants and criminals, and a systematic campaign to reduce this population through appropriate legal channels is long-overdue. But, ultimately, the reason to deport illegal immigrants is not to reduce the number of Hispanics, but because illegal residency is an affront to the rule of law.

Unfortunately, this administration’s efforts to uphold the rule of law on that front have been so ham-fisted that they threaten it in entirely new ways, diminishing the rights of citizens and legal residents alike, subjecting huge swathes of the country to something eerily akin to martial law, and damaging American families.

For now, however, the administration hasn’t really met any of the major criteria to call their policies “ethnic cleansing.” Progressives are wrong to toss out that loaded phrase, implying that deporting an MS-13 member is somehow equivalent to the savagery of Srebrenica. No, those things are different: this isn’t ethnic cleansing.

At the same time, what’s happening in America now isn’t normal. When you find yourself constructing tent-camps to detain thousands of children apart from their families, you need to splash some cold water in your face and realize that you are doing something wrong. Stop digging the hole deeper.

Anti-Trump Conservatives Wildly Out Of Touch With American Electorate,"In his rebuttal of Emerald Robinson’s attack on President Trump’s conservative critics, Jonah Goldberg singled me out for opprobrium because I applauded her thesis on Twitter. I thank him for this attention. It forces me to pause and collect my thoughts.

I prefer not to defend Robinson’s every turn of phrase, but her main point is irrefutable: Trump’s conservative critics have lost touch with the electorate. Their careers may indeed be humming along, as Goldberg claims, but politically they have maneuvered themselves into an untenable position.

In a democratic culture, the pundit is not a philosopher. He exists to inform and guide like-minded voters, which is only possible if they trust him to be thinking along with them.

I know what it feels like to be out of touch with the electorate. In the last presidential election I worked on the campaign of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. After he conceded defeat, I joined the foreign policy team of Sen. Marco Rubio. About a week before Rubio bowed out of the race, Nate Silver, the election analyst, published an article analyzing the senator’s dilemma.

Rubio, Silver explained, was almost every Republican’s fallback candidate. He was the first choice of only one group: “cosmopolitan conservatives.” Silver’s label hit me with a jolt of self-recognition. I have degrees from Stanford and Princeton universities, spend many weeks of every year abroad, and live and work in uber-liberal Washington DC, which I love. I am a social conservative, and I identify wholeheartedly with Red America. Silver had me cold: I am a cosmopolitan conservative.

Anti-Trumpers’ High Public Profile Is Inflated

The intellectuals Robinson attacks are also members of my clan. We may not live, as she suggests, in mansions, but we do breathe a rarified air—and we are very small in number. If we were to hold a national conference, we might fill a large bistro on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. Thanks, however, to the work we do in the policy world and media, we have a public profile out of proportion to our numbers.

Cosmopolitan conservatives have mistaken their outsized visibility in the media for indispensability to the conservative cause. The prevailing opinion among them during the election was not just that Trump was going to lose, but that he was going to deliver an historic defeat to the Republican Party.

In summer 2016, I became a traitor to my clan, breaking with this consensus and publicly supporting Trump. Some of my associates let me know they considered my move morally indefensible. It soon became obvious that they saw themselves as valiant knights manning the ramparts on the citadel of true conservatism, guarding the one true creed until Trump self-destructed.

After the debacle, the party would rebuild, and they would serve as the vanguard of renewal. They would be the ones to decide who would gain admission back into the citadel and who would wander forever in purgatory, repenting and pleading for readmission into the company of the good and responsible intellectual leaders of the conservative movement.

But Donald Trump won. Trump, it turned out, read the conservative electorate much more accurately than the finest minds in Republican punditry did. He identified immigration, drugs, unemployment, and, yes, religious liberty as key issues that the media, the Democrats, and, to a certain extent, the Republican Party establishment were ignoring or downplaying. He wove his blunt positions on these issues into an ideology of populist nationalism.

The conservative cosmopolitans refuse to credit this achievement. Instead, they recoil at Trump’s ideology and continue to serve as the self-appointed guardians of the conservative citadel.

Ronald Reagan, the Old Guard’s Idol

Goldberg’s new book, “Suicide of the West,” offers a valuable window into the worldview of the guardians on the ramparts. It champions “the Miracle,” Goldberg’s term for the prosperity and freedom that purportedly comes from a right-leaning version of classical liberalism.

This version looks suspiciously like the consensus among twenty-first-century cosmopolitan conservatives—my clan before I betrayed them. Goldberg’s idiosyncratic depiction of classical liberalism excludes all Democrats after Woodrow Wilson. They are “progressives,” thus anti-liberal.

Goldberg’s Miracle, in philosophical terms, combines Straussian natural rights theory with Milton Friedman’s free markets. It adds a dose of Alexis de Tocqueville on mediating institutions and civil society. For foreign policy, it calls for a muscular (yet idealistic!) approach. If this all sounds familiar, there’s a good reason. It’s Reaganism in a can.

By Goldberg’s way of thinking, Reaganism is the miraculous culmination of a long history of trial and error. It is not just the best way to organize society; it is the only way. There will never be a better one.

To borrow a phrase from Islam, Reagan is “the seal of the prophets” of classical liberalism. Therefore, Trump’s rejection of the cosmopolitan conservatism’s creed is not a legitimate disagreement about how to meet the challenges of the moment. It is an atavistic and “reactionary” attack on classical liberal “best practices” that all those generations of trial and error have so miraculously bequeathed to us. According to Goldberg’s philosophy, people like me are not wrong, we are reptile-brain ingrates.

American Populism Is Also an Old Idea With Merit

This idealized and ahistorical view of Ronald Reagan obscures what he shares with Trump. Reagan is a Republican establishment icon today, but in his own day he was an outsider. The populism that swept Trump into office did not begin in 2016. It dwells in American society—among both conservatives and liberals and among all races and ethnicities—and it has been there for a very long time.

Goldberg’s book fails to recognize this populism as a long, healthy, and deeply respectable American tradition.

Indeed, Reagan was the best representative of this populism in living memory. Call it Jacksonianism: the populist current in American politics that runs from Andrew Jackson to Abraham Lincoln, to Teddy Roosevelt, to Harry Truman, and down to Reagan.

This populism is preternaturally hostile to concentrations of unrepresentative, unelected, and unaccountable power. It abhors gigantism in government and in the private sector, directing particular ire at Wall Street and, of late, at Silicon Valley. It loves the flag, the working class, and holds those who defend the nation against its enemies in especially high regard.

Goldberg’s book fails to recognize this populism as a long, healthy, and deeply respectable American tradition. He depicts it instead as a diseased reaction to progressivism—reactionary and crypto-fascist. Those labels apply, by the way, not just to voters who opted for Trump, but also to progressives, those who voted for Clinton.

In short, pretty much all those who voted in the last election—the American people—are reptile-brain reactionaries. Conservative intellectual elites have been in the business of denouncing the American people before. Back then their leader was the misanthrope journalist H. L. Mencken.

At Odds With America, and At Odds With the Era

Consider the middle class business owner today in, say, central Pennsylvania. He is concerned about the influx of immigrants into his town, the disappearance of industrial jobs that traditionally supported the local economy, and the rising tide of drug addiction among the unemployed youth. In reaction to these developments, he turns away from Democrats, for whom he voted in recent elections, and supports Trump.

Embrace the timeless revelations that Reagan supposedly bestowed on mankind or wander the earth forever branded as an atavistic bigot.

The message of the cosmopolitan conservative class to that businessman is harsh and seeks to impose ideological discipline: Embrace the timeless revelations that Reagan supposedly bestowed on mankind or wander the earth forever branded as an atavistic bigot.

The lack of historical awareness in this view is staggering. Trump’s Jacksonianism is not just the latest emanation of a long American tradition, it is our local version of a broad trend visible throughout the Western world. Brexit in Britain, the rise of rightwing populists such as Matteo Salvini in Italy and Viktor Orban in Hungary, opposition to Angela Merkel’s immigration policies in Germany—these developments and many more are all reactions to a decaying political consensus in the West.

Across Europe the center-left is collapsing. People are moving toward socialism on the Left and nationalism on the Right. This trend, which is now overwhelmingly obvious, places Goldberg and his fellow knights of conservatism at odds not just with the American people but also with the entire era in which we are living.

The Ally of My Enemy Is—What, Exactly?

Irony of ironies, the cosmopolitan conservatives turn out to be the very people they decry: reactionaries. We usually hurl the word “reactionary” as a crude slur, a synonym for “rightwing extremist.” But in the literal definition of the word, a reactionary seeks to “turn back the clock” and restore a bygone era, one so much better than the decadent and misguided present.

The cosmopolitan conservatives, ‘wittingly or unwittingly,’ have become tools of the Democratic Party.

This meaning describes Goldberg and his clan to a “T.” Election after election in Europe and the United States tell us that the political truisms of the post-1989, end-of-history consensus have failed, but cosmopolitan conservatives simply refuse to grapple with this basic fact of civic life.

Their nostalgic longing for an idealized Reagan would be a mere personal tic were it not for their outsized visibility. They represent some of the finest talent among the conservative intelligentsia. They are capable and influential people, and our disoriented Republican political representatives need their guidance.

But they refuse to help shape the new Jacksonianism, let alone defend it against the attacks of its progressive enemies. By and large, the cosmopolitan conservatives have chosen to unleash unrelenting attacks on Trump, his supporters, and the meaning of his ascendancy. Those attacks run exactly parallel to the most pernicious lies of the Left regarding the Right, namely, that conservative voters—who represent half the electorate—are motivated by racism, bigotry, and tribal rage over a loss of white status.

To borrow a phrase from former Central Intelligence Agency director John Brennan, the cosmopolitan conservatives, “wittingly or unwittingly,” have become tools of the Democratic Party. They provide a fig leaf for a Democratic-led campaign whose point, ultimately, is to impose a hyper-progressive political order on an atomized populace.

Their energies these days seem far more focused on what they call ‘truth telling’ regarding Trump than on the defeat of his leftwing foes.

They claim to oppose this agenda, yet their energies these days seem far more focused on what they call “truth telling” regarding Trump than on the defeat of his leftwing foes. They would have us believe that by identifying Trump’s flaws they are saving democracy. They pose as agreeing with Democrats on only a limited set of meta-political issues such as “democratic norms” and “moral character”—the intellectual equivalent of striking a budget deal across the aisle.

In fact, they are doing something much more pernicious. Whether through pride, or anger, or vanity, or confusion, or misguided good intentions, they have become primary validators of the opposition’s main narrative. They are giving aid and comfort to those who depict the Republican president as a representative of pure evil in a Manichaean contest.

I predict that in the long run cosmopolitan conservatives will be honored by liberals for their services. Their denunciations of the reptilian intelligence and tribal motives of the ordinary people whose votes put conservatives into power will help the editors of The New York Times and Washington Post and the elite of Hollywood anathematize them culturally, just as Mencken did the liberal cause in his day a priceless favor of driving evangelical Christians out of the mainstream of public life.

Politics Cannot Demand Or Ensure Perfection

Politics is not a morality play. It is the art of the possible—and it is a team sport. King David sent Uriah the Hittite to die on the front lines of battle in order to steal his wife Bathsheba. His treachery reminds us that even the most revered and heroic figures in history turn out upon closer examination to have unsavory dimensions.

Trump’s sins are no bigger than those of most other presidents. The primary difference is that he wears his imperfections on his sleeve. By harping on these imperfections and magnifying them out of all proportion, the cosmopolitan conservatives are working to block the president’s broader agenda.

In their supposedly high-minded defense of principle, they have also given fuel to an aberrant conspiracy theory.

In his most recent book, Goldberg is admirably honest about this goal. He wants Trump to fail, because his agenda contravenes the Miracle, which is to say the Reaganism-in-a-can he and his clan favor.

The assistance cosmopolitan conservatives give Democrats does not stop with their criticism of the president and his voters. In their supposedly high-minded defense of principle, they have also given fuel to an aberrant conspiracy theory that is acting like a mental virus on the minds of Americans, especially liberals. However irrational Trump might seem—my sense is that he is crazy like a fox—and however much damage his tweets do to “civility,” the cosmopolitan conservatives risk shipwrecking our political compact by promoting fictions of Russiagate that are crazy in fact.

Telling fibs or whoppers or even off-color jokes has been the province of every American president since George Washington. Pronouncing a president you dislike to be an active tool of a foreign power conspiring to destroy America, someone who must be undermined by secret intelligence agencies and driven from office by prosecutors who work in star chamber proceedings, is the kind of politics our Constitution was explicitly designed to avoid. But it is the kind of politics many cosmopolitan conservatives practice now.

The Jonah Goldberg who in 2008 published “Liberal Fascism” would have recognized the FBI’s surveillance of Trump and the Robert Mueller probe for exactly what they are—outrageous abuses of power designed to smother the Jacksonian voice of the American people. The Jonah Goldberg of yesteryear wryly observed that if fascism ever came to America, it wouldn’t arrive dressed in brown shirts and jackboots. It would come instead wearing shirts emblazoned with big smiley faces. For some inexplicable reason the Jonah Goldberg of today fails to realize that those shirts would also say, “Impeach Trump!”

Here’s What Trump And NATO Should Do About Russia’s Aggressions,"President Trump’s North Atlantic Treaty Organization visit caused quite a stir. He rebuffed the Europeans and Canadians for their lack of will to spend even the minimum of what they pledged on defense.

Beleaguered German Prime Minister Angela Merkel was rebuked for working back-channel deals with Russian President Vladimir Putin to purchase 69 percent of her nation’s energy needs from Russia. This makes Germany the Achilles heel of the alliance. While other nations such as Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are working hard to get off Russian oil and gas, Germany is becoming addicted to it.

Finally, Trump admonished the NATO alliance for taking advantage of America’s generosity and goodwill in defending them by creating socialist utopias on the backs of the American taxpayers. The president’s comments regarding many of the NATO member states are justified. The strategic environment in Europe changed abruptly in 2014 when Putin began his four-year war against Ukraine.

Although all of the NATO members pledged to increase their defense spending to 2 percent of gross domestic product, few have achieved that goal. This shortcoming includes several of the economically prosperous nations, such as Germany, Canada and France. The United States has been very patient, perhaps too patient on this issue, especially when Germany’s Merkel, France’s Emmanuel Macron, and Canada’s Justin Trudeau have no misgivings about shamelessly ranting against American foreign policy.

Vladimir Putin’s Series of Escalating Aggressions

Now it’s Putin’s turn. His rise as the uncontested leader of Russia has unleashed a troubling reactionary ethno-centric nationalism. This included glorifying even the dark days of the Soviet Empire and doing all that could be to raise Russia back to an important international player.

The first manifestation of Russia’s growing hostility towards NATO and NATO-inclined nations began in 2007 when Moscow unleashed a crippling cyber-attack against Estonia. This was punishment for moving a Soviet-era memorial located in the Estonian capital of Tallinn. This was followed in 2008 by a devastating Russian attack on Georgia, resulting in the complete loss of the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

But not until 2014 did NATO begin to dispel its fantasy of a post-Cold War world with a friendly and cooperative Russia. That year, the pro-Moscow government was replaced by a pro-western one. Fearing the loss of its strategically vital Black Sea ports, Putin unleashed his army. So-called “little green men” appeared across Crimea and, without firing a shot, seized this Ukrainian territory.

At first Putin denied that these “little green men” were Russian troops. This flabbergasted the weak President Obama and feckless European leaders, who dithered about what to do. Putin then quickly annexed Crimea, declaring that it was his duty to protect ethnic Russians wherever they live. Not since Adolf Hitler’s 1938 Sudetenland speech did a leader declare such a policy in the continent.

This was followed quickly by a Moscow-orchestrated “ethnic Russian” uprising in eastern Ukraine (Donetsk and Luhansk). The war has been raging now for four years with no resolution or abatement in sight. The Kremlin’s new adaptive approach is what I call the “Strategy of Ambiguity.”

Moscow’s Strategy of Ambiguity

The “Strategy of Ambiguity” exploits the advantage Moscow has with any ethnic Russian population residing in neighboring countries. It practice, this begins with Russian special forces and intelligence officers appearing in ethnic Russian enclaves in neighboring countries, dressed as civilians and endeavoring to export an uprising to destabilize and area.

The purpose of this ambiguity is to avoid a direct confrontation with NATO. Should NATO uncharacteristically quickly respond to such a threat, Putin has plausible deniability and simply walks back from a potential clash with the West. He used such a cloak of ambiguity to confound North American and European decision makers regarding Ukraine.

Should the NATO alliance get caught up in endless debates and inaction, it would then be time to turn up the heat with a “local” and “civilian” proxy takeover of the enclave that would eventually appeal to Moscow to send in its army to help the besieged ethnic Russian populace.

At risk for such a Moscow-inspired “attack” are the NATO Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. All three have a border with Russia, with Estonia and Latvia including a sizeable ethnic Russian population living in their nations.

Compounding matters is their geography. The so called “unsinkable Russian aircraft carrier” of Kaliningrad sits astride Lithuania and Poland and is positioned to make air and sea reinforcement of the Baltic nations difficult, if not impossible, with its advanced weaponry. This leaves a narrow land corridor only 60 miles wide connecting Poland to the region. Called the Suwalki Gap, this area is of vital strategic importance should war come to the area.

How This All Bears on Trump’s Meeting with Putin

President Trump’s first meeting with Putin was designed to begin healing of some of the issues standing between the Russian Federation and the United States. Putin may have captured the essence of the Democrat Party’s unusual hostility towards Moscow by rebuffing them for trying to implicate Russia in a domestic internal power struggle.

This seems to be the rub for the American Left. Despite the hand-wringing and remonstrations about what President Trump did and did not say to Putin, there is much to contend with between the world’s two largest nuclear powers. Sadly, the ongoing Mueller investigation and its ill-timed indictments of 12 Russian operatives shifted focus from more pressing issues concerning American relations with Russia.

One of the most important issues that should be addressed is regional security in Europe. President Trump should make clear that, although the United States has concerns with NATO, America stands by its commitment to Article 5 (an attack upon one is an attack upon all). Putin needs to understand that no infringement of NATO nations will be tolerated and that the Kremlin’s propaganda blitz directed toward the Russian diaspora living in the Baltics must end.

What Else the Administration Should Do about Russia

Additionally, Moscow’s war against Ukraine must end, with a return of Crimea to Kiev. Trump should also announce a modest increase to the American force posture in Northern Europe to back up his commitment with action, fulfilling his policy of peace through strength. The current rotational force levels are woefully inadequate to serve as a deterrent against Putin-inspired adventurism in the Baltic States.

As one Estonian official told me, 300 American soldiers in the Baltics are worth more than 30,000 in Germany. Russia has a long history of attacking weak nations, and Putin must understand that he can’t meddle or intervene in any NATO country, especially Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The Kremlin perceiving a misstep or perceived weakness in the NATO alliance could have catastrophic consequences. A moderately stronger forward U.S. troop presence in the Baltics would go far to draw a line in the sand against any foolish notions that Putin may entertain.

If anything, the lessons of history are clear: weakness results in war, while strength and resolve leads to peace. We have a president who speaks the hard truth to advance an America First agenda. Peace and stability in Europe are in the interests of the United States.

Yes, the allies must do much more to share the burden of defense. Yes, the allies must renegotiate one-sided trade deals that rob American wealth. And yes, American prestige is on the line should Putin attempt to undermine the NATO alliance with a risky move. Reaffirming the American commitment to Article 5 of the Washington treaty would go a long way to send a clear message to Putin that he must not meddle with our allies in Europe.

How Can We Actually Respond To Russian Election Meddling?,"A day after his dispiriting press conference with Vladimir Putin, President Trump finally managed to say the right thing about Russian meddling in the 2016 election. While standing next to Putin on Monday, Trump gave a very unclear answer on Russian interference, saying he trusted his intelligence services, but that Putin strongly denies the allegations. Tuesday, he clearly said that the allegations are true, but that they had no effect on the election.

Like Trump, all of us should accept the fact that Russia attempted to affect the outcome of the 2016 election through cyber attacks launched against the United States. The question now is how should the United States respond to this attack, and what is the best way to degrade Russia’s ability to meddle in future elections. Unfortunately, for now these are not the questions being asked, in large part because as long as suggestions of Trump campaign collusion linger, we can have no idea how successful Russia’s operation against us was.

Regarding Russia’s attack on our elections, there is a spectrum of possibilities that range from catastrophic to “meh.” The catastrophic contingency is that Trump is a foreign agent under the power of Russia, who directly benefitted from shared stolen information. If this is true, he must be impeached and arrested, and Russia must be severely punished.

The “meh” contingency is that Russia ran some informational propaganda campaigns that flew under the radar of U.S. intelligence (or didn’t rise to a public response) and it had little if any effect on the outcome of the election. If this is true, the best response may be to basically ignore it publicly while shoring up our cyber security and offensive cyber capabilities in quiet.

The problem — and this is mostly owing to sloppiness by the Trump campaign like the Trump Tower meeting and hiring Paul Manafort — is that now collusion and meddling are both part of the same investigation. Until such time as Special Counsel Robert Mueller either exonerates or accuses Trump or his associates, we are locked into this paradigm.

But for the sake of this article, let’s take the president’s position that there was no collusion, but there was cyber meddling. How should we respond?

Threat Assessment

According to the National Security Strategy of the United States, cyber war and safety has become an absolute top priority. But not all cyber threats are equal. The most threatening involve the ability to take out something like a power grid and potentially kill thousands of Americans. We know how we would handle this kind of attack. It would result in a massive response against the bad actors, likely including conventional forces. In this sense, there is a kind of mutually assured destruction at work if, say, Putin attacks Three Mile Island.

The U.S. military breaks down cyber threats into the following six categories: Hacktivism, Criminal, Insider, Espionage, Terrorism, and Warfare. In the case of Russian meddling there is some overlap here. For example, WikiLeaks are hacktivists. Did they team up with the Russian state? If so, was the result: espionage or warfare? The answer to that question has a great deal to do with what the appropriate response should be.

If the extent of Russian meddling was hacking the Democratic National Committee, buying Facebook ads, and propping up Twitter trolls, then — at least publicly — this should result in an eye-roll. This is everyday playground stuff in the intelligence world. Back in December 2016, President Barack Obama explained why calling Putin out didn’t make a lot of sense: “He denies it, so the idea that somehow public shaming is gonna be effective, I think doesn’t reads the thought process in Russia very well.”

Hitting Back

Assuming Russian interference was basic and run of the mill, it falls in a grey zone, which is to say that it is a prevarication that does not cause a military response. It may have technically been an act of war, but it is not a Casus Belli. The clear mission of the United Sates would then be to attempt to kill the cyber threat from the Russian government.

The U.S. military has a kill chain for just these kinds of threats. I runs as follows: Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command and Control, and, finally, Actions on the Objective. So, yes, the United States is more than likely capable of hitting back at Russian cyber threats with equally effective measures, but there is a major complication in this. Once employed, a cyber attack capability is also revealed.

Put simply, in a cyber fight, once you shoot your enemy, they get the bullet. When a cyber capability is employed, in addition to causing whatever damage is intended, two other things happen. First, your adversary becomes more adept at countering that cyber measure; second, they become capable of employing it against you. This is why traditional symbolic shows of strength, once a mainstay of foreign policy, are not terribly useful in cyber security.

The idea that we have to do something to push back against the Russians makes sense in a twentieth-century model, but today, our responses must be more measured because we may only get one bite at the apple, and we may also enhance our adversaries’ capabilities in doing so.

One option, and one the Trump administration has availed itself of although nobody seems to mention it, is to employ traditional hard power. This means arming Ukraine, pulling out of the Iran deal, and killing Russian soldiers on Syrian soil. These are real responses that have occurred, regardless of the news media claims that Trump is rolling over for Putin.

One thing we must never forget is that the principal goal of Russian interference is to sow discord in our society and undermine our government. When Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi make baseless claims about the president being compromised, they are playing the cards that Putin puts in their hand. It’s a devastating mistake that they need to stop making, regardless of political ramifications.

Russia is running an informational campaign against the United States. This has always been true, but the Internet and especially the Internet of things, with its endless inputs into the system, make informational campaigns more powerful than they have ever been before. We are not helpless in this fight, but we won’t win it in a courtroom or at a press conference.

Our counter measures against Russia will take place out of eyeshot, which is frustrating, but necessary. In the meantime, the best position we can take is one of bemused lack of alarm. If the Mueller investigation shows Trump is a Russian agent, it will be time to freak out. But until that happens, a freakout does nothing but play into Putin’s hands.

Be patient, be thoughtful, and don’t do the Russians’ work for them.

"'White House Should Defend Diplomats,' Says Clinton, Who Let Them Die","Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton criticized the White House on Twitter on Thursday for failing to defend an American ambassador.

Ambassador @McFaul is a patriot who has spent his career standing up for America. To see the White House even hesitate to defend a diplomat is deeply troubling. https://t.co/gI8K8Tjg3M — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) July 19, 2018

Clinton’s tweet addressed the White House’s inability to rule out, in a press briefing on Wednesday, letting Russia question former ambassador Michael McFaul in exchange for the United States questioning the 12 Russian hackers who hacked the Democratic National Committee.

About two hours after the tweet, the White House released a statement, saying that President Trump would not let the Russian government interrogate McFaul. The Senate shortly after passed a nonbinding, unanimous resolution, 98-0, that condemned the exchange.

Clinton’s advocacy for American diplomats struck plenty of folks as hypocritical given the terror attack in Benghazi, Libya during her tenure as secretary of state, in which a U.S. diplomat died at a compound where Clinton, for political reasons, had repeatedly refused to authorize increased security.

Oh my…she should probably sit this one out https://t.co/BlwPx1s7eC — Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) July 19, 2018

Four Americans died during the attack, including American Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. Nine months before the attack, a State department security officer informed his superior, who was under Clinton, that the Americans in Benghazi were at risk.

The consulate lacked many safety provisions, largely because it was designated as “temporary,” to avoid requiring the security that the State Department mandates for permanent consulates. Leading up to the attack, Stevens sent hundreds of letters of concern about security to the State Department, with no significant response. During the terror attack, no rescue efforts were made to save the lives of the Americans in the consulate.

In the wake of Benghazi, Clinton blamed the deaths on a protest resulting from an anti-Muslim video rather than a planned terrorist attack, despite saying otherwise to her daughter and to the Egyptian president.

The White House’s statements on Wednesday were troubling, and the executive branch should wholeheartedly defend our diplomats at home and abroad, especially against hostile foreign powers. However, given her reprehensible record at defending American diplomats , Clinton should be the last person to criticize the current administration as “hesitant.”

How The Iraq And Afghanistan Wars Soured Americans On NATO,"What is the purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization? And is it worth the cost? Would the American people really be willing to treat an attack on any one of the 28 other NATO members as an attack on the United States? As Tucker Carlson put it to President Trump in an interview last week, “Why should my son go to Montenegro to defend it from attack?” Trump replied, “I understand what you’re saying. I’ve asked the same question.”

Americans have been asking such questions for a long time, but especially since they soured on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, almost nothing would persuade the American people to support the deployment of U.S. troops overseas—not even chemical weapons attacks on civilians, as we’ve seen in Syria since 2013.

Now, we have a president who is deeply suspicious of alliances like NATO that commit the United States to military action abroad. The Tucker Carlson interview came on the heels of Trump’s recent meeting with NATO allies in Brussels, where he urged members to double their military spending, calling them “delinquent” because the United States “has had to pay for them.”

This is a longstanding complaint of U.S. administrations going back to Reagan, and not just with members of NATO but a host of other U.S. allies. In Trump’s view, America’s alliances should be more or less transactional. He has long conceived of U.S. interests narrowly, in nationalist terms, and criticized the post-Cold War international order as a sucker’s deal for the United States. These attitudes coincide with questions about NATO’s proper role and mission that remain largely unanswered almost 30 years after the end of the Cold War.

He’s not the only one who thinks so. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that nearly half of Americans believe the United States should not have to defend its NATO allies if they don’t spend more on defense, including two-thirds of registered Republicans and nearly four in ten Democrats.

It’s impossible to explain this erosion of support for NATO without recognizing the role that Iraq and Afghanistan played in undermining American confidence in the U.S.-led international order. In a democracy, military alliances like NATO are only useful if they enjoy popular support. If an alliance loses that support, it loses cohesion. One of the lessons of Iraq and Afghanistan is that America can’t sustain long-term nation-building occupations without undermining support for military alliances that call for deploying U.S. troops overseas.

Popular opinion has always been a check on the use of American military power, but the experience of the past decade-and-a-half in Iraq and Afghanistan should leave no doubt about how alliances like NATO should work: to sustain public support, America and her allies must keep their military actions targeted and brief. No more regime changes, occupations, or nation-building. No more Iraqs or Afghanistans.

But it also means that in order to maintain a peaceful and stable global order, Americans are going to have to stop thinking of military force as a last resort and recognize that if we want to avoid large-scale conflicts, we might have to use force more often. If NATO is going to have purpose and cohesion in the twenty-first century, it will have to be as a global expeditionary force that conducts targeted missions to solve problems before they require large-scale military intervention.

A Short History Of America’s Inconsistent Foreign Policy

For that to happen, Americans are going to have to come to terms with what happened in Iraq and Afghanistan, and understand that not all U.S. military deployments overseas have to become massive long-term occupations that never seem to end in victory.

It’s easy to understand why so many Americans feel this way. Fifteen years after the United States invaded Iraq and toppled Saddam Hussein, the country is a mess. Riots are raging across southern Iraq, parliamentary elections in May have yet to produce a government, and the most influential player in Iraqi politics right now is Iran. So much for President George W. Bush’s dream of Iraq as the vanguard of a revolution that would democratize of the Middle East.

As for Afghanistan, seventeen years after U.S. forces first deployed there in the wake of 9/11, we still have 15,000 troops in the country, the Taliban control vast swaths of territory, and ISIS now has a foothold in the north. Despite Trump’s initial opposition to America’s longest war, he was persuaded by advisors to increase troop levels, although there has been no dramatic change in overall U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, and no plans for such a change.

Whatever successes we’ve had in Iraq and Afghanistan, the perception among the American people is that these wars have been colossal failures. A majority believe that we never accomplished our goals in Iraq and remain deeply skeptical of ongoing U.S. engagement in Afghanistan.

It’s been this way for a while. Barack Obama was elected president in 2008 largely on an anti-war platform. Once in office, he sought to diminish U.S. leadership abroad, especially in the Middle East, convinced that American involvement was the source of the region’s instability, not the solution to it. Elsewhere, his administration infamously pursued a policy of “leading from behind,” with predictably disastrous consequences, particularly in Libya, the birthplace of Europe’s migrant crisis. Obama might have used the language of liberal internationalism, but like Trump, his goal was always to revise the American-led world order, chiefly by reducing America’s role in it.

Like Obama, Trump opposed the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and regularly excoriated the Bush administration on the campaign trail in 2016—a tactic that proved popular. But while Obama and Trump arrived at similar conclusions about America and the international order, they got there by very different routes. Obama wanted to pull back because he doubted American strength, but Trump wants to pull back because he thinks we’re so strong we don’t need an international system at all.

Both of these views depart from the traditional post-war understanding of America’s place in the world. After World War II, successive American administrations built and sustained an international system that was designed to serve American interests by pulling much of the world into a rules-based system of alliances and trade underwritten by U.S. economic and military might. The system worked insofar as it helped rebuild a shattered Europe, contain an expansionist Soviet Union, and ultimately defeat communism. The Korean and Vietnam wars were of course products of Soviet containment doctrine, but they were catastrophic strategic mistakes: Korea was preventable and Vietnam was unnecessary.

Even with these mistakes, the system held together. The post-Cold War order that emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union built on this system, promoting free trade, multilateral agreements, and international institutions. Although the benefits of globalization were spread unevenly in America, on the whole the international order promoted economic prosperity at home and stability abroad.

As for military conflict, the liberation of Kuwait in 1991 was perhaps the finest hour of the post-Cold War international order, when the United States led a coalition of 34 countries to expel Iraqi forces from a defenseless nation. Desert Storm was supposed to be an exemplar of what then-President George H.W. Bush called the new world order: an era of international cooperation and global stability underwritten by American military power. The war was broadly supported by the American people at the time and still considered worthwhile a decade later.

NATO’s original purpose was of course to prevent Soviet expansion into western Europe after World War Two. But the Balkan wars of the 1990s, which arose from the breakup of Yugoslavia, prompted NATO’s first major post-Cold War operations and represented a shift in the alliance’s mission, from checking Soviet expansion to imposing peace on the European continent. Like the Gulf War, the NATO interventions in the Balkans in the 1990s were broadly supported by the American people. Notably, the 1995 campaign in Bosnia found more public support for allied, as opposed to unilateral, action.

Still, to remain relevant in a post-Soviet world and justify the enormous expense of maintaining the alliance, NATO needed a broader and more strategic mission than preserving stability in former Yugoslavia. As the Bush administration came into office, there was increasing consensus that NATO needed to embrace—and be capable of fulfilling—a global expeditionary role in defense of its members’ global interests. The pretext for precisely such a mission did not take long to materialize.

The attacks of September 11 were the first and only time that Article V, the self-defense mechanism of the NATO treaty, has ever been invoked. The Bush administration’s response called for “draining the swamp” of terrorist safe-havens, and NATO embraced that global expeditionary mission when it went into Afghanistan.

The invasion of Iraq soon followed, and by 2006 Americans had soured on the Iraq War. By 2008, Obama’s anti-war message was resonating with a growing number of Americans, many of whom were (and are) disillusioned with American military intervention abroad, whether as unilateral action in Iraq or as part of NATO’s mission in Afghanistan.

So What About NATO?

All of this brings us back to the current status of NATO. For all Trump’s bluster, the alliance is not in danger of breaking up anytime soon. At the close of the recent summit, Trump reaffirmed America’s commitment to NATO and signed the official communique, which stated that an “attack against one Ally will be regarded as an attack against us all,” reaffirming Article V of the NATO charter.

But questions about NATO’s purpose and structure persist. A growing segment of the Right, especially among those in the Republican Party who subscribe to Trump’s “America First” view of foreign policy, have little use for NATO as it is, much less the myriad institutions that comprise the international order.

The question is not whether the United States and NATO should have acted after 9/11, but whether the invasion and long-term occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan were the right decisions.

It’s not just Trump’s base on the Right. Earlier this year, one survey found that more than 86 percent of respondents believe America should use military force only as a last resort, and 57 percent believe U.S. military aid to foreign countries is counterproductive. Moreover, the desire for military restraint was bipartisan, with 78 percent of Democrats, 64.5 percent of Republicans, and 68.8 percent of Independents favoring restrained military actions overseas.

Polls like this are important, because if the last 15 years of foreign wars have taught us anything, it’s that America can’t sustain a protracted military conflict or pursue grand strategy across administrations without popular support. The result has been chaos in America’s posture toward the world. Much of Obama’s foreign policy was a reversal of eight years of Bush’s foreign policy, just as Trump has pulled out of many key Obama-era initiatives like the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal. This is precisely the instability and inconsistency that alliance treaties are supposed to prevent, to protect foreign policy from the vagaries of public opinion by institutionalizing it.

That’s why the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were so disastrous for American foreign policy. They soured the American people on maintaining long-term strategic alliances like NATO, as well as the post-9/11 role of NATO as a global expeditionary force.

Of course, after 9/11, inaction was not an option. At the very least, the United States had to move against al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. Once America invoked Article V, NATO also had to take action. If it hadn’t, Article V would have been proven worthless, effectively ending the alliance.

So the question is not whether the United States and NATO should have acted after 9/11, but whether the invasion and long-term occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan were the right decisions. In hindsight, they weren’t—and not just because the outcomes of those wars have been inconclusive or because they cost us in blood and treasure. They were the wrong decisions because the American people were never going to tolerate long-term nation-building abroad. Seen in this light, America’s inability to maintain strong support for military alliances like NATO is one of the worst and most enduring legacies of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars—one that will be with us long after the Trump administration.

Iraq and Afghanistan were in a sense doctrinal mistakes of NATO theory that proved to be incredibly costly, much like Korea and Vietnam were to Cold War-era Soviet containment. Alliances like NATO can’t take public support for granted, which means that its military operations and strategies need to be crafted accordingly. If NATO doctrine called for military confrontation in Afghanistan, it should have stopped short of a years-long occupation and nation-building mission.

The larger lesson here is that modern democracies can only sustain short wars. Therefore, military force should not be a last resort. It should be used early so that it doesn’t have to be used for long. If NATO has a future in the post-Iraq international order, it will be as a U.S.-led global expeditionary force that undertakes smaller, targeted missions, and does not consider military force a last resort but a necessary element of maintaining global stability. Whether the American people will tolerate such an alliance remains to be seen.

Revisiting Battlestar Galactica: ‘A Measure of Salvation’ And ‘Hero’,"This is the 22nd in a series of “Battlestar Galactica” recaps. This year marks the 15th anniversary of the franchise. Read the last piece, “Revisiting Battlestar Galactica: ‘Collaborators’ And ‘Torn’” here.

Spoilers ahead.

“A Measure of Salvation,” addressing the ethics of biological warfare, is the sort of episode which drew viewers to the series as an exploration of post-9/11 anxieties. A plot device at least as old as The War of the Worlds gets a fresh treatment.

“Hero” is the sort of episode that aggravated some viewers, suggesting the military possibly had foreknowledge of Cylon intentions or even incited the Cylons. It obliquely echoes the partisan debate over how much the Bush administration knew about al-Qaeda’s plans in the nine months before the 9/11 attacks.

The theory in “Hero” works no better than the one about 9/11. The episode contains a serious continuity error. The pilot at the heart of “Hero” is supposedly held captive for three years, which incorrectly places his capture after the Cylons’ mass attack.

Even assuming a longer captivity, Adama (and the writers) seemingly forgot the Cylons are planners motivated by faith. Indeed, we learn later in the series that Cylon infiltration occurred decades before the attack. Building the necessary military force would also have taken many years.

‘A Measure of Salvation’

Apollo and Athena lead a mission to the abandoned Cylon Basestar. The landing party finds several living Cylons, engaged in a prayer practiced only by those who believe they will not be resurrected. A survivor calls Athena a traitor, but reveals they are dying of an infection to which she may be susceptible.

Apollo requests permission to kill the survivors. Helo convinces Adama they should be seized for interrogation.

The landing party and survivors are both quarantined. Dr. Cottle determines the Cylons contracted a strain of encephalitis affecting their brains. Humans are immune – as is Athena, due to her pregnancy with a half-human child.

Cottle also informs Adama he has a vaccine which can suppress the disease in Cylons with regular injections. Adama uses the vaccine as leverage to interrogate the Cylons. One of the survivors divulges that Baltar is alive and assisting the Cylons to find Earth. He also reveals the Cylons fear their infection would spread though resurrection.

Apollo realizes the Cylons could be annihilated if the fleet executed the infected prisoners within range of a Resurrection Ship. Pres. Roslin is excited by the idea, while Helo argues the mass killing of beings like Athena would rob the humans of their humanity.

Roslin ultimately approves Apollo’s plan, even after Adama avoids responsibility by noting he requires a presidential order for the use of biological weapons.

Galactica jumps to a known Cylon supply line and launches a Viper attack. As expected, they are met by a Basestar and Cylon Raiders. Adama orders the execution of the prisoners during the battle.

However, by the time the order is to be carried out, the prisoners have died from lack of oxygen. The ventilation system was sabotaged by Helo, who expects to be arrested after Galactica escapes.

Roslin deduces Helo or Athena committed the sabotage. Adama tells her the matter will not be investigated. As Cottle believes the virus to be 3,000 years old, Adama concludes the infected beacon was left by the Thirteenth Tribe as a marker to Earth. Roslin agrees, but notes the Cylons are on the same trail.

In the Cylon fleet, the lead Three and Caprica Six confront Baltar about the beacon he failed to mention in his report on the infection. He confesses he knew of it and is taken from his quarters for interrogation.

Baltar is tortured by the Three, but survives with mental assistance from Caprica Six. He questions Three’s faith and later seemingly proclaims love for her, though he is actually verbalizing his conversation with Six. A confused Three discontinues the questioning.

‘Hero’

Galactica comes upon two Raiders pursuing a third, which identifies itself as piloted by Lt. Daniel “Bulldog” Novacek (Carl Lumbly). The pursuing Raiders are destroyed by Vipers, while Adama allows the third to land aboard Galactica.

Bulldog emerges from the Raider; he is recognized by Adama, confirmed as human by Cottle, and later debriefed by Adama and Roslin.

Adama tells Roslin that Bulldog piloted a black ops mission for Adama when he commanded the Battlestar Valkyrie. Adama claims Bulldog was believed killed while conducting reconnaissance of colonists violating the Cylon peace treaty by mining too close to the armistice line. Bulldog claims he was held by the Cylons for years and escaped when his captors contracted a virus.

After Bulldog leaves, Roslin reveals she does not entirely believe this account. Adama asks her to trust him.

Adama visits Tigh (still drunkenly brooding in his quarters) to relay the news about Bulldog. Tigh, who also served on the Valkyrie, advises Adama to tell Bulldog “what really happened.”

Instead, Adama confesses to Apollo that the Admiralty had him cross the armistice line to spy on Cylon military capabilities. Bulldog was disabled by Cylon ships, but Adama fired upon Bulldog to protect the mission and perhaps prevent Cylon retaliation. Adama now believes the mission likely instigated the Cylon attack on humanity.

Meanwhile, Bulldog visits Tigh. Over drinks, Tigh – ostensibly believing Adama had already come clean – reveals the truth to Bulldog.

Starbuck reviews video of the recent dogfight that shows the pursuing Raiders had easy chances to kill Bulldog, raising the suspicion he was allowed to escape. Starbuck takes her evidence to Tigh. Bulldog arranges a meeting with Adama with the purpose of killing him. Tigh interrupts the assault, explaining to Bulldog that he was set up by the Cylons to be an assassin.

Adama tenders his resignation to Roslin over his possible role in provoking the Cylon attack on humanity. Roslin refuses, noting he may have been a pawn of the Admiralty. Instead, she plans to award Adama a medal for 45 years of fleet service to boost public morale; his punishment will be to accept it.

On the Cylon Basestar, the lead Three dreams of being killed aboard Galactica; when she awakens, she is in bed with both Baltar and Caprica Six. As Three’s dreams intensify, she orders a Centurion to shoot her. She has a vision (seemingly of the opera house) between death and resurrection and is exhilarated by the experience.

"Rage When Trump Targets Media, Crickets When De Blasio Targets Media","If you listen to President Donald Trump’s critics, you’d think freedom of the press in this country is under siege. Trump has labeled “fake news” media as “the enemy of the people,” a phrase that seems fitting for a totalitarian, not an American president. But is it really unique for an American politician to attack and delegitimize the media?

That’s the assumption driving the media’s largely self-serving narrative about Trump’s threat to press freedom. But New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio reminded us this week when he slammed Fox News that Trump isn’t the only politician attacking the media, and that liberals have no problem with attacks on the press — so long as the attacks are aimed at the right outlets.

De Blasio placed the lion’s share of the blame for the dismal state of contemporary American politics on Fox News and its owner Rupert Murdoch in an interview with The Guardian.

“If you could remove News Corp from the last 25 years of American history, we would be in an entirely different place,” he said, attributing the “negativity and divisiveness” in American society, and Trump’s election, to the work of Fox.

De Blasio’s comment here echoes the attacks on Fox News that were a constant theme of the Obama administration. Very few liberal journalists jumped to the defense of the network then, and very few defend the network now. Yet these same journalists come unstuck when Trump singles out liberal outlets, and work themselves into a panic over him trying to shut them down.

Of course, it’s very unlikely Trump actually would take steps to shut down the press. But there’s little question that Trump’s attacks on journalists he doesn’t like are producing some unsavory results. If reporters and columnists who speak about the issue are to be believed, threats against them on the rise. Scenes in which journalists are singled out for abuse at Trump rallies give his supporters the appearance of a mob thirsting for the humiliation of the president’s foes, if not their blood. Though there is nothing new about antagonism between politicians and press foes, the level of invective at play here seems to reflect the way the rise of social media and Trump has coarsened political discourse.

Nevertheless, for all of the hysteria about Trump seeking to shut down democracy, the ability of the press to not merely do its job but to regularly attack the president with an openly partisan spirit is undiminished. For many in the mainstream media, particularly The New York Times and CNN, Trump’s presidency has caused them to shuck off even the faintest pretense of objectivity.

If former White House advisor Steve Bannon termed the media the true “opposition party” to Trump, journalists like CNN’s White House correspondent Jim Acosta seem to have willingly embraced that role. His grandstanding at White House press briefings has transformed him into a celebrity and a hero to the anti-Trump “resistance,” even if his debates with press secretary Sarah Sanders have made him all but indistinguishable from an opinion columnist.

Still, the impression the liberal press create is of something awful and unique about Trump’s attacks on the media.

Trump’s language and his willingness to abuse his tormentors at rallies strikes some observers as a form of incitement that is both indirectly responsible for violence directed at journalists, such as the attack on the newsroom of the Annapolis Capital-Gazette. That shooting had nothing to do with Trump, as it was carried out by an individual with a long running grudge against the paper for legal reasons, but that didn’t stop the liberal press from trying to draw a connection.

The only genuine incident of political violence in this country during the last year and a half actually involved a supporter of Bernie Sanders attacking a Republican baseball practice that left House Minority Whip Steve Scalise and others wounded. Yet it has become something of an article of faith that what Trump is doing eclipses harsh rhetoric — including over the top and egregious comparisons of his administration to fascists and Nazis — from his predecessors or his opponents.

To note Obama’s ongoing vendetta against Fox News doesn’t excuse Trump’s willingness to play fast and loose with the truth or to decry any critical piece of journalism as “fake news.” Yet the widespread belief that Trump’s attacks on the media are unique is both ahistorical and a testimony to the bias of those who saw nothing untoward in Obama’s campaign to brand Fox as detached from reality.

Obama warned listeners that those who watched Fox got a distorted view of events — the liberal press didn’t mind. Now some of those same journalists and outlets characterize Trump’s similar attacks on CNN or The New York Times as Stalinist. When reporters from papers whose coverage was insufficiently sycophantic were kicked off Obama’s campaign plane, liberal reporters didn’t protest much. They also quickly moved past the news that the Justice Department was targeting James Rosen because of his reporting.

De Blasio’s salvo at Fox was an opportunity for some of the president’s critics to correct this inconsistency, especially since it coincided with Trump’s latest anti-media tirade. What the mayor was really saying is that he liked it better when network and cable news was uniformly liberal, albeit while pretending to be objective and neutral.

As has often been pointed out during the last quarter century, what Murdoch and the late Roger Ailes did with the creation of Fox was to fill an underserved audience that comprises approximately half of the American people. The “divisiveness” of Fox largely consists of it providing an alternative view. What Fox provides is a taste of democracy the left finds unpalatable.

Like most of his exercises in “counter-punching,” Trump’s attacks on his press detractors are unseemly and serve primarily to please his supporters. But if these believe Trump’s journalistic critics have no credibility, it’s largely because the liberal media has spent the last generation convincing them of their bias. And with figures like Acosta playing the role of opposition party, why should Trump’s fans believe the liberal press, even when they are telling the truth about the president?

If attacks on the media and a desire to purge the press of troublesome critics is truly a sign of incipient fascism or a desire to eradicate the First Amendment, then why is the liberal press silent about de Blasio’s attacks on Fox? Sadly, too many in the media seem willing to mimic de Blasio’s transparently pathetic claims that liberal attacks on the press are somehow a defense of democracy while those of Trump aim at undermining it. By sticking to that party line, liberal journalists are merely reinforcing the belief of many Americans that their complaints about Trump persecuting them are merely partisan talking points rather than outrage about a genuine threat to freedom.

"In ‘Slender Man,’ Hollywood Monetized A Nearly Murdered Child’s Trauma","Horror films are a standard in Hollywood’s portfolio, but the real horror in the latest film “Slender Man” is the exploitation of an unspeakable tragedy for the sake of a few dollars.

Sony broke ethics on Aug. 10, 2018, when it released “Slender Man,” a horror film based on viral photo-shopped images and fan fiction, known as creepypasta, of a long, faceless, tentacled figure in a suit. But the image and the legends created by internet users first reached the public eye in 2014, when two middle school girls stabbed a classmate as some form of demonic tribute to Slender Man.

In what appeared to be a horrifying ending to a truly horrifying tale, Screen Gems, a subset of Sony, picked up the concept of Slender Man and turned it into a film. Critics typically downplay horror films, and the film was not well received, with a score of 13 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. The Hollywood Reporter called it “boring” and “devoid of personality.” But in terms of finance, “Slender Man” was a success. According to Variety, the film was set to make around $10 million last weekend, putting it in third place at the box office.

A nice paycheck for a living nightmare that afflicted at least three families. In May 2014, Anissa Weier and Morgan Geyser, both aged 12, lured Payton Leutner, also aged 12, out to the woods, where they stabbed her 19 times and left her for dead. Payton had to crawl to a nearby road where a cyclist stopped to help her. After the attack, Payton’s mother, Stacie, said Payton was “terrified and crying” in the hospital trauma room.

“I could see that she was covered — her arms and her legs and her abdomen — they were covered in stab wounds,” she told 20/20 in 2014. Payton bears the scars of the attack to this day.

Geyser and Weier were sentenced to 40 and 25 years in a mental health institution, respectively. The Daily Mail reported that Geyser, sentenced at the age of 15, wept with her head on the desk while she received the verdict. Both she and her lawyers pleaded for her release into her parents’ care.

A psychiatrist testified that Geyser was an “empathic, kind, compassionate and bright young woman who is very remorseful about what has taken place.” Geyser was diagnosed with schizophrenia and was given a longer sentence than Weier because of the intensity of her disorder.

Bill Weier, Weier’s father, complained when the film was announced and a petition was made to halt the release of the film. More than 21,000 people signed it. Weier told the Chicago Sun Times: “All we’re doing is extending the pain all three of these families have gone through.”

In Milwaukee, Marcus Theaters decided not to show the movie in any of their theaters. Ann Stadler, vice president of Marcus Theaters, gave a statement to the Chicago Sun Times explaining their decision: “Like many people across the United States, Marcus Theatres was deeply concerned and saddened when the Slender Man phenomenon touched southeastern Wisconsin in such a profound way, changing the lives of many families forever. After careful consideration, and out of respect for those who were impacted, we have decided not to play the upcoming ‘Slender Man’ movie in Milwaukee and Waukesha counties.”

Rather than allowing the victim and the families affected to heal emotionally, physically, and spiritually, by leaving the victim and this gruesome story alone, Hollywood chose to monetize this tragedy and provide a perennial reminder to the victim of the incident that altered her life completely. While Hollywood often turns real-life tragedies into films or documentaries, it has only been four years since the attack, and not even a year since the case was resolved. The victim is still suffering the effects of the attack.

In the general media frenzy that surrounds bizarre tragedies like this, Sony picked up the rights to the creepypasta and announced a film to come from it. While the studio Screen Gems stated that the film is “based on an original fictional character that became a viral internet sensation … and is in no way a dramatization of any real-life events,” it is still too similar to be mere coincidence.

USA Today noted that from the trailer, a wall is covered with drawings “that resemble sketches Geyser drew.” Other scenes include Slender Man, a tall creepy figure, following a girl into the woods.

In a victim impact statement, Payton’s mother wrote that her daughter “slept with scissors under her pillow” and had to live with 25 scars that covered her body. Payton was so traumatized that she could not even testify at her attackers’ hearings. And Hollywood reaped $10 million from the concept that inspired her attack.

Here Are Horrifying Things From The New Mexico Terrorist Compound,"New evidence revealed in a court filing on Friday further suggests that the five adults arrested earlier this month on charges of child abuse at a rural New Mexico compound were running a terrorist training camp. Those arrested include Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, his sisters Hujrah Wahhaj and Subhannah Wahhaj, Subhannah’s husband, Lucas Allen Morton, and a women an FBI agent involved in the case identified as Wahhaj’s “Islamic wife,” Jany Leveille.

Officials also took custody of the Wahhajs’ 11 children, placing them with the state’s child protective services. A few days later, agents discovered, in a tunnel on the sprawling property, the corpse of Siraj Ibn Wahhaj’s three-year old son, Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, whom he had kidnapped in Georgia late last year from his estranged wife, Hakima Ramzi.

The Wahhaj siblings’ father is the senior Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, who according to National Review Online’s Andrew McCarthy is “a well-known (some would say notorious) sharia-supremacist imam who runs a mosque in Brooklyn (Masjid al-Taqwa).” In January, following the kidnapping of his three-year-old grandson, the imam made an appeal on Facebook for information on the whereabouts of his children and 12 grandchildren.

Later, according to the senior Wahhaj, one of his daughters asked for help from a man in Atlanta, saying they were starving at the New Mexico compound. The Atlanta contact passed the information to the imam, who told the authorities, resulting in the early-August raid.

Taos County District Attorney Donald Gallegos filed charges of child abuse against the five adults, while Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and Morton faced additional charges related to the kidnapping. The prosecutor sought to detain the adults while the investigation continued, arguing the defendants presented a risk to the community given the cache of weapons recovered from the compound and statements by some of the children that they were being trained to attack schools and other locations.

Two weeks ago, a state court judge denied the government’s request to detain the defendants pending trial and ordered their release on a $20,000 “signature bond,” which means money is paid to the court only if the defendants violate the terms of release—nothing is paid up front. The terms of release the judge set merely required the defendants to wear a GPS tether, cooperate with child protective services, and obtain suitable housing.

Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, however, is not eligible for release because of the outstanding warrant from Georgia related to the kidnapping, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement took custody of Leveille beause she is a native of Haiti, according to USA Today.

On Friday, the DA filed a motion asking the court to reconsider its decision to release the defendants on bond. That motion detailed the evidence known to date, including some just discovered, which strongly suggests that the Wahhaj family had turned their rural compound into a terrorist training camp. Inexplicably, though, the mainstream media has moved on from this story or, in the case of CNN, has decided that terrorists-in-training make for an interesting personal-interest story.

Tweeting its article under the caption “New Mexico compound family struggled with life off the grid,” CNN linked to its sympathetic profile of the Wahhaj family living in the rural southwest. Rather than detail the circumstances surrounding the raid and the arrests of the siblings and their spouses, CNN instead painted a touching portrait of the parental figures.

“One of the men tenderly wiped the nose of a crying child,” a local resident who saw the group during a rare outing to the city told CNN. Sure, the defendants are accused of training their children to shoot up schools, CNN noted in passing, but locals’ real fear is “that the publicity around a case infused with allegations of terrorism, children abuse and faith healing might contribute to a rise in racism and Islamophobia.”

The timing of CNN’s bizarre attempt to garner sympathy for the Wahhaj clan couldn’t have been worse given that Friday’s filing by Taos County’s DA summarizes disturbing evidence of the group’s intent to commit acts of terrorism. CNN, however, is not alone in going off the grid in covering this huge story of a homebuilt terrorist camp. Too busy Stormy-chasing, the entire mainstream media has ignored the recent developments in the Wahhaj case. And what hasn’t been told is terrifying.

An FBI agent testified that two of the malnurished children said “they had been trained in advanced firearms handling and had been instructed to shoot law enforcement personnel when the time came and that they would be instructed in the future to attack specific targets such as teachers, schools, banks, and other ‘corrupt institutions.’”

In his motion, the prosecutor stressed that the defendants possessed an arsenal of weapons. He included evidence from a neighbor stating that the group used the shooting range on the compound excessively. Add to that the seizure of a DVD that describes how to build an “untraceable assault rifle” at home and a book on the psychology of combat, and the picture of a group bent on a terrorist attack forms more clearly.

[scribd id=387257050 key=key-rATWvGyKnWIJaf8kGN1x mode=scroll]

There is more: The prosecutor presented to the trial court a letter Morton delivered to Muhammad, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj’s brother. That letter encouraged Muhammad to follow Allah “until he makes you die as a martyr as you wanted and the only way is by joining the righteous (us).” The letter added that Muhammad should “take all your money out [of] the bank and bring you guns,” showing the Wahhajs intended to grow their fighting force beyond the 16 residents of the compound.

[scribd id=387257049 key=key-7f5uMAQE2OkrM8tmc5hs mode=scroll]

Agents also recovered a ten-page, handwritten document, titled “Phases of a Terrorist Attack,” from the compound. That document included instructions for “the one-time terrorist” and provided detailed instructions on determining ideal attack locations, using “choke points,” defending “safe havens,” escaping perimeter rings, and detecting sniper positions. This document indicates the defendants were not merely talking a deadly talk, but had been carefully planning an attack.

Follow-up interviews with some of the children garnered more evidence, including statements that Morton told them he “wished to die in jihad, as a martyr,” and Leveille and Subhanna Wahhaj joking about dying in jihad. The children also relayed that Leveille and Suraj intended to confront “corrupt” institutions, such as the military, CIA, and American schools, and reveal to them “the truth.” If they refused to accept the message, the children said, Leveille would provide a signal to Suraj, who would attack the individual.

The DA’s motion also states “Siraj told the group that if police ever came to the property at night, they were to defend the property using firearms.” A search of the compound revealed numerous guns located at the end of a tunnel. The children told officials the tunnel served as an escape route should authorities raid the compound.

Additionally, the government detailed several passages in a journal recently recovered from the compound, written by Leveille. Leveille’s journal makes quite clear that she is delusional. For instance, she believes that Suraj’s son, Abdul Ghani, was originally conceived in her womb, but that Hakima Ramzi used black magic to remove the fetus from Leveill’s womb and transfer him to Ramzi’s womb. Leveille’s journal also detailed the circumstances of Abdul Ghani’s death, and her revelation that “ghani would be resurrected as Jesus.”

Whether motivated by mental illness or an extremist view of violent jihad, the Wahhaj family presents a serious risk to the community. Hopefully, when the state court holds a hearing on August 29 at 1 p.m. on the DA’s motion to reconsider, the judge will agree and assure that none of the defendants remains free to execute their plans. Also, hopefully the FBI, which reportedly was monitoring the compound, doesn’t wait so long to intervene next time.

Joe Scarborough: Trump Is Worse Than 'The Attacks On The Twin Towers',"There is truly nothing sacred anymore. Not awards shows. Not sporting events. Not John McCain’s funeral. Not even 9/11.

MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough has declared that President Trump is a “far graver threat to the idea of America” than the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. It all began with a tweet to a column he wrote in The Washington Post on the eve of 9/11.

“Trump is damaging the dream of America more than any terrorist attack ever could,” Scarborough tweeted.

My Latest—> Trump is damaging the dream of America more than any terrorist attack ever could. https://t.co/DEnYurEFmW — Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) September 11, 2018

In the column, titled “Trump is harming the dream of America more than any foreign adversary ever could,” Scarborough made the argument that after 16 years of U.S. “missteps,” Trump “savaged” alliances, “provided comfort” to hostile powers, “attacked” U.S. intelligence and military communities, and “lent a sympathetic ear” to neo-Nazis and white supremacists.

He wrote:

For those of us still believing that Islamic extremists hate America because of the freedoms we guarantee to all people, the gravest threat Trump poses to our national security is the damage done daily to America’s image. As the New York Times’ Roger Cohen wrote the month after Trump’s election, ‘America is an idea. Strip freedom, human rights, democracy and the rule of law from what the United States represents to the world and America itself is gutted.’ Osama bin Laden was killed by SEAL Team 6 before he accomplished that goal. Other tyrants who tried to do the same were consigned to the ash heap of history. The question for voters this fall is whether their country will move beyond this troubled chapter in history or whether they will continue supporting a politician who has done more damage to the dream of America than any foreign adversary ever could.

He elaborated further on “Morning Joe”:

Forget about knocking down buildings in the Financial District. Forget about running planes into the Pentagon. Those are tragedies, but those tragedies brings us closer together. America is an idea. You gut America of that idea. That’s when you do the most harm to America,” Scarborough echoed Cohen’s line. ‘You have people looking at a country that is saying they want to ban people from coming to America because of their religion. You have just this week Brett Kavanaugh, who wants to be on the Supreme Court, refusing to answer whether people should be banned from coming to the United States because of their race in his reading of the Constitution. The accumulation of that, the retweeting of neo-Nazi videos, Charlottesville, I mean, I can go on and on. What he said about majority-black countries. That is tearing more at the fabric of America than attacks on the Twin Towers did. We rebuilt from that. We became stronger because of that. But this seems to me a far graver, graver threat to the idea of America.’

According to Scarborough, we should “forget” the attack on the World Trade Center and “forget” the attack on the Pentagon simply because Trump says and does moronic things. In his mind, Trump wanting a travel ban from terror-infested countries and some stupid retweet is equivalent to the roughly 3,000 Americans that were murdered on 9/11.

After receiving harsh blowback for his nauseating comparison, Scarborough tried walking it back.

Jeryl, you’re a great example for all of us—especially me today. Many have been offended by a tweet I sent out earlier re: my @washingtonpost article. Even if they did not read the article, I should have shown more care on the tweet’s wording and the column’s conclusion. https://t.co/A7zJR38JiC — Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) September 11, 2018

The column was focused on 17 years of strategic missteps. The last paragraph became the sole focus of Trump supporters. On every other day of the year, I do not shy away from negative feedback from the right, the left or from Trump supporters. — Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) September 11, 2018

On September 11th, I’ll read the column again and think about whether I could have said the same thing in a way less offensive to Trump supporters on September 11th. — Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) September 11, 2018

Scarborough needs to understand that his Trump-9/11 comparison isn’t about offending Trump supporters. Moreover, 9/11 isn’t about Trump.

It’s this kind of derangement that hinders the message of Trump’s media critics. There is plenty to criticize this president for. Scarborough himself laid out plenty in his column, from Trump’s embarrassing Charlottesville remarks to his cozying up to dictators. All of that is valid. But it’s when they say he’s worse than 9/11 or Pearl Harbor or the Holocaust that their valid complaints become unhinged hyperbole.

Maybe it’s a bit more complicated for Scarborough. He and his co-host (and fiancé) Mika Brzezinski were two of Trump’s biggest suckups during the GOP primary ahead of the 2016 election. Perhaps Scarborough feels overwhelming guilt that the slobbering romance he once had with the candidate helped propel him into the White House. So now he feels the need to overcompensate with these over-the-top, pathetic attacks. Whatever conflict Scarborough may have with himself, his politicization of 9/11 for the sake of a jab at Trump is abhorrent and shameful.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/09/14/joe-scarborough-trump-worse-america-attacks-twin-towers/,2018-09-14
"Rift Between Police, Feds Allowed NM Terror Compound To Fester","Questions keep coming about how the U.S. justice system responded to a New Mexico compound that housed five alleged would-be jihadists and 11 reportedly malnourished children along with the remains of a twelfth child who died on the compound.

A federal grand jury recently indicted the five alleged jihadists on weapons and conspiracy charges, alleging the group created their compound in the desert outside Taos, New Mexico as a training camp and firing range to facilitate a “Common plan to prepare for violent attacks government, military, educational and financial institutions” and sought to “engage in jihad and form an army of jihad” according to the federal indictment published by the Department of Justice on September 11.

The five suspects—Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, Lucas Morten, Subhanah Wahhaj, Hujrah Wahhaj, and Jany Leveille—had previously faced state charges of child abuse, but the charges floundered in court after a New Mexico judge dismissed charges against all five suspects when state prosecutors missed a 10-day deadline for a preliminary hearing. Prosecutors argued extenuating circumstances but were rebuffed.

The federal charges echo information first laid out in the state prosecutors’ motion urging the judge in the case to reconsider the judge’s dismissal of bail, given evidence that the suspects had discussed targeted attacks against “corrupt institutions,” including schools and an Atlanta-area hospital. Suspects reportedly had repeatedly discussed a willingness to fight and kill law enforcement, and to die as “martyrs.” Prosecutors cited testimony from children inside the camp saying they were being trained to conduct school shootings or other attacks.

The five suspects were arrested after local police launched a raid to respond to reports of child abuse from inside the camp, only to discover a shooting range, multiple weapons, and documents describing a potential terrorist attack, including a document titled “Phases of a Terrorist Attack.”

Neighbors Were Telling Police Disturbing Information

The federal charges highlight what appears to have been a disconnect between state and federal law enforcement over how to address the New Mexico compound and its armed residents. The compound was under surveillance from both local and federal law enforcement, but it took several months for law enforcement to intervene despite reports from the local community.

Sirraj Ibn Wahhaj faced a Georgia-issued child abduction warrant, and neighbors reportedly identified the missing child, Abdul Ghani, who was known to possess a limp. A child with a limp was also reportedly detected by FBI aerial surveillance.

Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe has told media that local authorities didn’t intervene over concerns they lacked probable cause to act. But CNN reported that a local officer told neighbors law enforcement’s “hands were tied” by the FBI.

“‘We’ve gotten multiple calls on this child but, at the same time, our hands are tied because the FBI has whatever they got going on up there with them,’” CNN quoted the officer as saying, according to a recording the news channel acquired.

This would not be the first case in which a disconnect between federal and local officials led to potential danger for a local community. In Garland, Texas, a free speech protest and cartoon contest on May 3, 2015 was targeted by two Islamic State-linked jihadists armed with rifles, Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi. The attack took place while an undercover FBI agent shadowed the two attackers and took pictures.

While the FBI says they warned Garland police that the two may have had an interest in the target, police guarding the event say they were never warned of an impending assault. Simpson and Soofi injured a security guard before being shot dead by a quick-acting Garland police officer.

Failing to Intercept ‘Known Wolves’

Repeated incidents of western law enforcement agencies having detailed intelligence on terror suspects, yet failing to prevent attacks has led to the use of the term “Known Wolves” by policy critics, who say agencies aren’t doing enough to preempt terrorism by those under surveillance.

Feelings of mutual distrust between local and federal law enforcement linger, despite the Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) system intended to incorporate local and state law enforcement with the FBI’s efforts. While local law enforcement complains of having hands tied or being left uninformed of dangerous jihadists in their midst, federal law enforcement sometimes sees local law enforcement as compromised.

Examples include Fairfax County Police officer Weiss Rasool, who in 2005 allegedly searched police databases and tipped off terror suspects, who were preparing to flee when federal law enforcement swooped in to make an arrest. And in 2009 FBI agents fumed when a local imam tipped off Najibullah Zazi, the leader of a three-person terror cell plotting bombings in New York City. The imam had been contacted by New York Police Department officers looking for intel.

While federal authority over terrorism cases predominates, the New Mexico case feeds local law enforcement’s growing perception that they can’t assume the FBI has the situation under control. It also indicates the difficulties for local law enforcement when complicated cases with possible terror links are suddenly thrust into their laps.

It’s local law enforcement, not federal agents, who remain most likely to receive community tips, and to recognize changes in their neighborhood beats. Local law enforcement is also more likely to be the first to spot tell-tale signs of criminal schemes to finance terrorism, or crimes like child or domestic abuse that may open a window of intervention, as occurred in the New Mexico case.

While investigators’ handling of the child abuse case in New Mexico raises concerns, the use of state-level terrorism prosecutions has seen significant success in states like neighboring Arizona, where counterterrorism laws do not require an “overt act” to prosecute, as federal terrorism laws do, making preemptive prosecutions of would-be jihadists more viable.

We should continue to expect better cooperation between all levels of law enforcement in the effort to defeat jihadist terror. But at the end of the day, local law enforcement should not accept having their “hands tied” from protecting their communities nor take a back seat on counterterrorism.

"10 Red Flags About Sexual Assault Claims, From An Employment Lawyer","I stand athwart the streamroller of sexual misconduct complaints that crush the innocent, end marriages, and destroy careers. In the Me Too era, I am an employment attorney in the politically incorrect vocation of defending who must pay if misconduct is found.

My skin is thick, and I do not melt when asked, “How dare you!” I dare because I do not want the innocent to be wrongly punished. I know it’s a very unfashionable to advocate on behalf of the presumption of innocence, and I am often reminded of how insensitive and outdated the principle is in today’s climate.

Of course, courtesy to the alleged victim is absolutely essential to be effective. To do otherwise is completely counterproductive and quickly turns the focus from the facts to the conduct within the inquiry. So I go to great pains to make my questions respectful.

I don’t interrupt. I don’t impugn. I just ask the accuser to walk me through what he or she is saying entitles him or her to damages. We know from cases like the Duke lacrosse team that mob justice can trample defense of the falsely accused.

It’s not nice or politically correct to say, but people do sometimes lie to get money, revenge, power, attention, or political advantage. False allegations of sexual assault have been documented. Even the most pro-accuser advocates acknowledge that 5 percent of the claims are simply false.

When the complaint is “he said/she said,” we should not helplessly acquiesce to coin-flip justice that picks winners and losers based upon the identity politics profile of the accused and accuser. Experience with a career’s worth of complaints in hearings, depositions, and negotiations has taught me some tells, red flags that warn that an innocent person stands accused.

Without naming any particular accusation, I offer these factors for consideration to the fair-minded who remain open to the possibility that guilt or innocence is not simply a question of politics. I also remind the reader that politicizing these accusations have allowed men like Harvey Weinstein, Al Franken, Matt Lauer, Les Moonves, Bill Clinton, and Keith Ellison to escape accountability. Nobody seems to care if they walk the walk so long as they talk the talk.

1. The accuser uses the press instead of the process.

Every company has a slightly different process for harassment and assault complaints. Often it begins with a neutral investigator being assigned to interview the accuser first, then potential corroborating witnesses. When an accuser is eager to share with the media but reluctant to meet with an investigator, it’s a flag.

2. The accuser times releasing the accusation for an advantage.

For example, when the accuser holds the allegation until an adverse performance rating of the accuser is imminent, or serious misconduct by the accuser is suddenly discovered, or the accused is a rival for a promotion or a raise, or the accused’s success will block an accuser’s political objective. It’s a flag when the accusation is held like a trump card until an opportunity arises to leverage the accusation.

3. The accuser attacks the process instead of participating.

The few times I’ve been attacked for “harassing” the victim, it has always followed an otherwise innocuous question about the accusation, such as: Where, when, how, why, what happened? I don’t argue with accusers, I just ask them to explain the allegation. If I’m attacked for otherwise neutral questions, it’s a red flag.

4. When the accused’s opportunity to mount a defense is delegitimized.

The Duke Lacrosse coach was fired just for saying his players were innocent. When the players dared to protest their innocence, the prosecutor painted their stories in the press as “uncooperative.” If either the accused or the accused’s supporters are attacked for just for failing to agree with the accusation, it’s a red flag.

5. The accuser seeks to force the accused to defend himself or herself before committing to a final version.

Unfortunately, this has become the preferred approach of the kangaroo courts on college campuses. It’s completely unfair because it deprives the accused of the opportunity to mount an effective defense. When the accuser demands the accused speak first, it is a strong indication that the accuser wants the opportunity to fill in the details of the accusation to counter any defense or alibi the accused might offer. It’s a red flag.

6. The accused makes a strong and unequivocal denial.

In most cases, there’s some kernel of truth to even the most exaggerated claims. When the accused reacts with a dissembling explanation full of alternatives and rationalizations, I tend to find the accuser more credible. Rarely, however, the accused reacts with a full-throated and adamant denial. When it happens, it’s a red flag that the accusation might have problems.

7. The accuser makes unusual demands to modify or control the process.

It’s a flag when the accuser demands a new investigator or judge without having a substantial basis for challenging the impartiality of the process that’s already in place.

8. When the accuser’s ability to identify the accused has not been properly explained.

In the Duke lacrosse case, the accuser was shown a lineup of photos of potential attackers. Every photo was of a member of the team. None were of people known to be innocent. It’s a red flag when an identification is made only after the accused appears in media and the accuser has not seen the accused for a number of years or was otherwise in regular contact with the accused.

9. When witnesses don’t corroborate.

10. When corroborating witnesses simply repeat the accusation of the accuser but don’t have fresh information.

It is now clear that accusations of sexual misconduct will forever be a tool to change results in elections and Supreme Court nominations. It’s disappointing to see so many abandon the accused to join the stampede of a mob that punishes any who ask legitimate questions about accusations.

These accusations destroy the lives of the accused, often men, and bring devastation to the women who love and support them. Some of the falsely accused commit suicide. When the mob attacks legitimate inquiry into the accusation, it’s a sure sign that the mob isn’t confident about the truth of the allegation. Rather than shrink in fear when attacked, we should take it as a sign that there is a risk that the accused is innocent, and the questions need to keep coming.

Revisiting Battlestar Galactica: ‘The Ties That Bind’ And ‘Escape Velocity’,"This is the 30th in a series of “Battlestar Galactica” recaps. This year marks the 15th anniversary of the franchise. Read the last piece, “Revisiting Battlestar Galactica: ‘He That Believeth In Me’ And ‘Six of One’” here.

Spoilers ahead.

These episodes lack a dominant narrative. In “The Ties That Bind,” Cally dies, with actress Nicki Cline making the most of a sad, unheroic end. Aaron Douglas gets more out of Tyrol’s grief in “Escape Velocity,” as that downward spiral relates to and contrasts with how Col. Tigh and Tory process the shared secret that they are Cylons.

The schism among Cylon forces erupts into war, which is left unaddressed in “Escape Velocity.” Similarly, Starbuck’s mission on the Demetrius gets little screen time.

Apollo’s new political career provides a look at fleet governance not seen since “Colonial Day.” The Quorum of Twelve’s proceedings, where Pres. Roslin responds directly to colonial delegates, borrow from “question time” in the United Kingdom.

Baltar further grows into a religious leader. His provocations very loosely allude to those of Jesus, though no direct parallel seems intended.

‘The Ties That Bind’

On a Basestar, the Cavil shot by the Centurions resurrects, learning the Cylons remain split over lobotomizing the Raiders, unboxing the Threes, and liberating the Centurions.

Cally, feeling maternal and marital stress, is taking anti-depressants. Awakened by Nicky’s cries, she brings the child to Joe’s Bar. Cally sees Tory stroke Tyrol’s elbow before storming out.

Roslin receives cancer treatment. Adm. Adama sits beside her bed and reads from a detective novel.

Roslin later introduces Apollo as the new Caprican delegate to the Quorum. Roslin and Adama duck questions about the Demetrius. Roslin privately expresses her annoyance to Adama that she is forced to cover for the mission.

On the Demetrius, Starbuck pores over star charts while the crew fumes over her frequent, unexplained course corrections.

In their quarters, Tyrol denies any affair with Tory, while Cally ignores hin.

Cavil tells Natalie Six he will stop lobotomizing the Raiders and argue her case for unboxing the Threes, despite thinking it is a bad idea.

Before the Quorum meets, Zarek warns Apollo that Roslin is growing authoritarian and slips him a copy of an executive order. During the meeting, Roslin rebuffs Apollo’s attempt to help her manage questions about the Demetrius. Apollo then raises the previously secret executive order, which allows Roslin to staff a new court system. Roslin deftly claims the order was merely a draft.

Cally seeks more medication from Dr. Cottle. He sympathizes with her problems, but warns the pills may be affecting her thinking.

On the Demetrius, Starbuck paints markers of her path to Earth above her bed. Anders suggests she communicate with the crew. Starbuck thinks Anders is talking about their marriage. They start fighting, but Starbuck would rather frak, which they do. Afterward, Starbuck confesses she feels different since returning from Earth.

Cavil announces an agreement to unbox the Threes, who can be resurrected at a nearby server node. The two Cylon factions proceed in separate Basestars. Upon arrival, Cavil’s Basestars attack the rival faction without the Resurrection Ship present. Cavil dismisses Boomer’s concerns over the mass murders.

Cally finds a note for Tyrol suggesting a tryst with Tory. Cally opens a panel and squeezes into the wall outside a weapons locker. She witnesses Tyrol with Tory… and Tigh, learning Tyrol is a Cylon.

Cally sneaks away. Tory notices the panel ajar outside the locker. Cally takes Nicky down to a Viper launch tube to kill herself and Nicky. Tory arrives and calms Cally just enough to gain possession of Nicky, then flushes Cally out the launch tube.

‘Escape Velocity’

Tyrol speaks at Cally’s memorial in Galactica’s temple. Roslin tells Adama she likes the service, implying her funeral wishes.

Tigh and Tory visit Tyrol. Tory suggests they are perfect and Tyrol should switch off his guilt over Cally’s death. Tyrol rejects the idea.

Tory then visits Baltar for a tryst. They are interrupted when the cult is attacked by a polytheistic gang.

Although Baltar hid during the attack, his mental Six prods him to rally his followers against the old gods. Baltar leads a counter-attack on the temple, preaching and toppling idols until he is arrested.

Tyrol’s grief distracts him from replacing a fuse in Racetrack’s Raptor, which crashes on the hangar deck. A mechanic suggests Tyrol is “only human.” Tyrol snaps: “Don’t say that!”

Adama visits Roslin during treatment with a classic novel, Searider Falcon. Adama declares it his favorite; he loves it so much he has never finished it. Roslin suggests she follow suit, causing an awkward moment.

Tigh visits Caprica Six, asking how she deals with guilt over the Cylons’ mass murder. She replies she cannot help but feel the pain. Tigh keeps seeing Six with Ellen’s face.

In the brig, Roslin informs Baltar she is investigating the attack on his cult, but she is dying and has fewer scruples about how she deals with him.

At Joe’s, Adama tries to console Tyrol, who loudly insults Cally’s memory and Adama’s kindness. Publicly challenged, Adama begs Tyrol not to force his hand. Tyrol dares Adama to demote him, which Adama does.

Apollo confronts Roslin at the Quorum over an order limiting the size of Baltar’s cult. Roslin raises security concerns. Other Quorum members object, noting Baltar’s group is similar in some ways to sects within their own tribes. The Quorum overrides Roslin.

Tigh visits Six again, alone. He still sees her as Ellen. She removes Tigh’s eye patch and offers to provide him clarity. He tells her to unhand him. She thrashes him, but when he asks her to continue, she kisses him.

Meanwhile, Galactica’s security is trying to divide Baltar’s cult. Under mental Six’s encouragement, Baltar takes several beatings before Apollo arrives to announce Roslin’s order was rescinded.

In the sickbay, Roslin acknowledges Apollo does what he thinks is right, but considers it a dangerous luxury. Adama begins reading the part of Searider Falcon he claims he has not read. After Roslin falls asleep, he recites the text even after closing the book.

Baltar, observed by Apollo, sermonizes that every person has a spark which loves them despite their faults. As Tory, mental Six, and cultists smile, Baltar claims the one true god finds them all perfect and they can love others once they love themselves.

Prosecutor Details 12 Huge Inconsistencies In Kavanaugh Accuser’s Story,"The sex crimes prosecutor who questioned Christine Blasey Ford about her allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has released a memo detailing inconsistencies in Ford’s testimony.

“I do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the Committee,” Rachel Mitchell wrote in a five-page-long memo obtained by The Washington Post. “A ‘he said, she said’ case is incredibly difficult to prove. But this case is even weaker than that.”

Throughout the blistering memo, Mitchell, who questioned Ford on behalf of Senate Republicans during a public hearing last Thursday, outlines 12 big problems with Ford’s testimony.

1. Witnesses Corroborate Not Ford, But Kavanaugh’s Stance

Ford named a friend, Leland Ingham Keyser, as at the drunken high school party where Ford says Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her. Keyser has repeatedly said that she does not remember any such event and has refused to corroborate Ford’s story.

Ford also named two others — Mark Judge and Patrick “PJ” Smyth — as being at the party or in the room when the attack allegedly occurred. Both of these men have also said, under penalty of legal action, they have no recollection of any such attack taking place.

“Dr. Ford identified other witnesses to the event, and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them,” Mitchell wrote.

2. Ford Keeps Changing Her Story On When The Alleged Attack Occurred

Initially, Ford kept altering the timeline about when the alleged attack took place, then suddenly narrowed it down to the summer of 1982 just before her testimony without explaining how she was able to do that.

Here are the different versions of the story she’s told reporters, lawmakers, and her therapist, from Mitchell’s memo.

• In a July 6 text to the Washington Post, she said it happened in the “mid 1980s.” • In her July 30 letter to Senator Feinstein, she said it happened in the “early 80s.” • Her August 7 statement to the polygrapher said that it happened one “high school

summer in early 80’s,” but she crossed out the word “early” for reasons she did not

explain. • A September 16 Washington Post article reported that Dr. Ford said it happened in the

“summer of 1982.” • Similarly, the September 16 article reported that notes from an individual therapy session

in 2013 show her describing the assault as occurring in her “late teens.” But she told the

Post and the Committee that she was 15 when the assault allegedly occurred. She has not

turned over her therapy records for the Committee to review. • While it is common for victims to be uncertain about dates, Dr. Ford failed to explain

how she was suddenly able to narrow the timeframe to a particular season and particular

year.

3. Ford Didn’t Name Kavanaugh As The Attacker Until Now

Leading up to the hearing, Ford told The Post she had therapy notes from a marriage counseling session in 2012 in which she outlined the alleged assault. Post reporter Emma Brown noted that Ford did not name Kavanaugh as the assailant in these notes. The only time Ford has named Kavanaugh as the assailant on the record was after he was nominated as a Supreme Court justice.

Mitchell outlines this in the timeline below.

• No name was given in her 2012 marriage therapy notes.

• No name was given in her 2013 individual therapy notes.

• Dr. Ford’s husband claims to recall that she identified Judge Kavanaugh by name in

2012. At that point, Judge Kavanaugh’s name was widely reported in the press as a

potential Supreme Court nominee if Governor Romney won the presidential election.

• In any event, it took Dr. Ford over thirty years to name her assailant. Delayed disclosure

of abuse is common so this is not dispositive.

4. Ford Has Changed The Description Of The Trauma She Allegedly Suffered

“When speaking with her husband, Dr. Ford changed her description of the incident to become

less specific,” Mitchell notes. “Dr. Ford testified that she told her husband about a ‘sexual assault’ before they were married. But she told the Washington Post that she informed her husband that she was the victim of ‘physical abuse’ at the beginning of their marriage. She testified that, both times, she was referring to the same incident.”

5. Ford Can’t Recall Key Details That Could Corroborate Her Story

Mitchell noted that Ford doesn’t remember who invited her to the party nor does she remember how she heard about it. She doesn’t remember how she got to and from the party where she says the attack took place — which before cell phones is odd.

“She stated that she ran out of the house after coming downstairs and did not state that she made a phone call from the house before she did, or that she called anyone else thereafter,” the sex prosecutor noted.

6. Ford Has Changed Her Story About The Alleged Attack

“According to her letter to Senator Feinstein, Dr. Ford heard Judge Kavanaugh and Mark Judge talking to other partygoers downstairs while she was hiding in the bathroom after the alleged assault,” Mitchell states. “But according to her testimony, she could not hear them talking to anyone.”

7. The Number Of People She Says Were Present At The Party Keeps Changing

As The Federalist reported last week, Ford’s testimony has been inconsistent in the number of people she says were at the party. She told Post there were four boys at the party, but in her polygraph statement, she said there were “four people boys and a couple of girls.”

8. Ford’s Recent Memory Is Full Of Gaps

Mitchell notes that Ford was unable to remember key details of events that have unfolded over the past couple of months. She couldn’t remember whether she showed the Post reporter her therapy notes or if she merely summarized them for her. When asked if she had a copy of the notes in her possession when she reached out to the newspaper’s tipline via WhatsApp on July 6, Ford couldn’t remember if she had a copy of her notes in her possession or if she reviewed them in her therapist’s office.

Ford has yet to provide a copy of these aforementioned notes to the Senate Judiciary Committee — the only piece of hard evidence she has acknowledged exists.

At the same time that Ford says she can’t remember very recent events, she is claiming very clear knowledge of a traumatizing event that allegedly occurred some thirty years ago, although research and experience shows trauma very frequently clouds memories rather than crystallizing them.

9. Stated Reasons For Coming Forward Are Not Consistent

When Ford’s letter was passed along to Sen. Dianne Feinstein in late July, Ford requested anonymity, but her stated desire to conceal her identity doesn’t match her actions. Mitchell notes: “the person operating the tipline at the Washington Post was the first person other than her therapist or husband to whom she disclosed the identity of her alleged attacker.”

“She testified that she had a ‘sense of urgency to relay the information to the Senate and the president,” Mitchell wrote. “She did not contact the Senate, however, because she claims she ‘did not know how to do that.’ She does not explain why she knew how to contact her Congresswoman (Rep. Anna Eshoo) but not her Senator.”

10. Ford’s Polygraph Is Suspect

Ford was unable to recall if she took the polygraph on the day of or the day following her grandmother’s funeral in early August — a memory lapse Mitchell notes is troubling, adding that “It would also have been inappropriate to administer a polygraph to someone who was grieving.”

Polygraphs are so notoriously unreliable that they are inadmissable as evidence in federal courts.

11. The Claimed Psychological Effects Of The Trauma Keep Changing

Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee she needed the hearing to be delayed because she was afraid of flying due to trauma associated with the alleged attack. When pressed on her travel habits, however, Ford conceded that she does in fact fly frequently, including to Hawaii, French Polynesia, and Costa Rica.

12. Ford’s Lawyers Probably Affected Ford’s Story

When asked if Ford had considered taking up Senate Republicans on their offer to fly out to California, she said that was “unclear,” which could mean that her attorneys failed to communicate a key component of the negotiations.

In a detailed outline of events, Mitchell explained that Ford’s attorney’s behavior throughout the whole ordeal likely significantly affected Ford’s version of events.

This is why Kavanaugh should consider suing Ford for defamation now: Not to retaliate or seek damages, but in the public’s interest. The Senate Judiciary Committee’s proceedings involving Ford’s accusations left many observers unsure what to think. Also, a defamation case would give both Kavanaugh and Ford access to judicial procedures—document requests, interrogatories, subpoenas, depositions, location inspections—for discovering the truth.

Consider the Precedent in Hiss Versus Chambers

There is precedent for such a case: the Hiss-Chambers slander suit. On August 3, 1948, Whitaker Chambers testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) that Alger Hiss, a former high-ranking government official, was a Communist. Two days later, Hiss appeared before the same committee to deny the Chambers’ accusations. The men’s competing testimony resulted in a he-said/he-said stalemate.

Hiss challenged Chambers to make his accusations again outside the safety of a legislative hearing where Chambers’ testimony had been privileged. So on August 27, 1948, Chambers gave a radio interview and repeated his assertion that Hiss had been a Communist.

Hiss promptly sued Chambers for defamation. When Hiss’s attorney took Chambers’ deposition, he demanded that Chambers produce “any correspondence, either typewritten or in handwriting, from any member of the Hiss family.”

To the attorney’s surprise, Chambers complied. He retrieved an envelope hidden for ten years in a relative’s home containing typed and handwritten notes from Hiss. The materials, which included stolen State Department information, appeared to confirm Chambers’ testimony and show Hiss had engaged in espionage during the 1930s.

Hiss’s defamation suit failed, Chambers was vindicated, and Hiss was ultimately convicted of perjury. Where the congressional hearings had been inconclusive, the civil defamation case had helped uncover the truth.

Apply this to Kavanaugh v. Ford

The Senate hearing involving Ford’s accusations against Kavanaugh similarly ended in a he-said/she-said impasse. A defamation lawsuit might remedy that.

Ford has already made her accusations outside the privileged setting of a congressional hearing. In September 2018, in an interview she gave to the Washington Post, Ford accused Kavanaugh of having assaulted her. She stated that he pinned her on a bed, groped her, ground his body against hers, and attempted to remove her clothing. She described him as “trying to attack me” and putting her life in danger by covering her mouth to prevent her from screaming.

Defamation is a false statement that exposes a person “to public scorn, hatred, contempt or ridicule, thereby discouraging others in the community from having a good opinion of, or associating with, that person.” A statement that falsely charges a person with the commission of a crime or immorality is considered defamatory “per se” and presumed to cause injury.

The conduct Ford attributed to Kavanaugh was clearly criminal. Ford’s statements about Kavanaugh, if false, would undoubtedly be defamation per se.

Believing Accusers Versus Due Process

In a defamation suit, Kavanaugh, as a public figure, would need to prove that Ford’s statements were false and that Ford made them knowing they were false or with reckless disregard as to whether they were false. One objection to filing a defamation claim might be that it contends a woman who alleged sexual assault lied.

The humane response to someone disclosing she is the victim of sexual assault is sympathy, comfort, and support. And victims must be encouraged to pursue justice.

At the same time, when one person accuses another of a crime seeking punishment, due process must be observed. An accused should be permitted to test an accuser’s claims, including through cross-examination, which the Supreme Court has called the “greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.”

Ford came forward to block Kavanaugh’s confirmation, a form of punishment. It is not an insult to Ford or other accusers to adhere to standards of due process in these circumstances, which a defamation suit could supply. Fair-minded observers will acknowledge that not all accusations of sexual assault turn out to be true. Consider the case of Jamie Leigh Jones.

The Judiciary Committee and Spectacular Lies

On October 7, 2009, Jones appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the same committee before which Ford testified. Jones, already well known from media appearances, told the committee she had been drugged and gang-raped while working for a defense contractor in Iraq.

Reading from a prepared statement as Ford did, Jones described in detail how several male co-workers offered her a spiked alcoholic drink on her fourth day on the job. After that, she said, she remembered nothing until she awoke the next morning in her room, “naked, sore, bruised, and bleeding.” Jones explained to the senators that when she went to the bathroom that morning, the “evidence that I had been raped was abundantly clear to me.”

Jones further described how “a rape kit confirmed that I had been assaulted both vaginally and anally by multiple perpetrators.” She told the senators that the “severity of [her] physical injuries” required her to return to the United States, where she learned “that [her] breasts were disfigured and [her] pectoral muscles had been turned” as a result of the attack. “Reconstructive surgery was required,” she said.

Jones sued her employer for the sexual assault, and in 2011, a federal jury determined Jones likely lied.

Sen. Al Franken praised Jones for her courage, persistence, and strength. “You are an amazing young woman,” he told her. Based in part on Jones’ testimony, the Senate enacted the “Franken Amendment,” placing new restrictions on defense contractors. Meanwhile, as Stephanie Mencimer writes in her comprehensive account of Jones’ case, the “thirty white, male Republican senators who voted against [Franken’s amendment] were vilified in the media as rape apologists, lampooned on Jon Stewart’s The Daily Show, and mocked on a parody Web site, www.republicansforrape.org.”

After all this, something surprising happened. Jones sued her employer for the sexual assault, and in 2011, a federal jury determined Jones likely lied. Mencimer, a staff reporter for Mother Jones, dove into the trial evidence following the verdict to try to make sense of the result. With admirable candor, Mencimer writes that she found “[t]he trial record was so at odds with Jones’s public story that I was simply dumbfounded.”

According to Mencimer, the evidence at trial included Jones’ rape kit (which was not consistent with Jones’ accusations), medical tests and examinations (which showed no date-rape drug in her system, no torn pectoral muscles, and no deformities), contemporaneous emails and text messages, co-worker testimony, expert testimony, and photographs.

Key evidence also included Jones’ medical history. That evidence showed Jones, before the alleged attack, had experienced psychosomatic symptoms, among other conditions. She had also claimed on at least three prior occasions to have been raped, although she’d never filed charges. Also, an independent examination by a forensic psychologist concluded Jones had faked symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome and had a narcissistic personality.

In the end, the jury, even applying the lower “preponderance of the evidence” standard of proof that governs civil trials, concluded Jones had not been raped. The court ordered Jones to pay the defendant’s court costs of $145,000. Putting the case in some context, Mencimer observed:

[T]here’s a strange paradox about sexual assault. The crime is massively underreported to law enforcement, but at the same time, a fair number of people lie about it. The best official estimates suggest that between 8 percent and 10 percent of all rape claims are false. And unfortunately, sometimes when people lie about rape, they lie spectacularly. Crystal Mangum did so in 2006 when she brought charges against members of the Duke University lacrosse team. Tawana Brawley did so in 1987 when, as a teenager, she nearly sparked race wars in New York by falsely accusing six white men, including police officers and a prosecutor, of raping her.

To this list can be added the case of “Jackie,” reported the following year by Rolling Stone, when a woman falsely accused men of gang rape at a University of Virginia fraternity.

Just because some accusers have lied about being sexually assaulted obviously doesn’t mean Ford or any other accuser has lied. But that’s the point of due process: no case should be pre-judged, and each case should be decided on its own merits.

As for Impressions of ‘Witness Credibility’

To assess witness credibility, one usually must observe the witness. Yet Ford’s account during the confirmation process was presented to the world almost entirely through her attorneys. She appears to have spoken directly in a single print interview with the Washington Post.

The only time the public saw Ford was during her Judiciary Committee testimony. Even then, her core allegations were written, perhaps with aid of counsel, and she read them aloud. She answered questions for just a short time. These came in five-minute increments for a cumulative time of about an hour. After that brief appearance, Ford again receded from public view behind the impenetrable wall of her legal representation.

A defamation case would allow Ford to testify at greater length, telling her story directly in her own words. She would likely sit for a deposition for a minimum of seven hours and testify at trial for at least that long. Such testimony would provide a far better chance to see and hear her and evaluate her credibility.

Falsus in Uno, Falsus in Omnibus?

During the committee hearing, Sen. Richard Blumenthal noted the concept of “[f]alsus in uno, falsus in omnibus” (i.e., “false in one thing, false in everything”). Under this principle, factfinders may doubt a witness’s general credibility based on a single lie.

Senate questioner Rachel Mitchell’s examination may have provided some glimpses into Ford’s credibility generally. Although Ford stated she feared flying (which was relevant because her attorneys said she was unable to fly to Washington D.C. the prior week to meet with the committee), she flew to Washington D.C. for the September 27 hearing. Was this “falsus in uno”?

We also learned Ford consulted with Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s office about retaining attorneys and took a polygraph test in August, a time she said she still was assuming she would not go public with her accusations. That chronology does not seem to make sense. A defamation suit would allow attorneys to pick up where Mitchell left off and elicit more testimony on such matters.

Psychotherapy Records, Swords, and Shields

A defamation lawsuit also would allow the parties to conduct discovery of relevant documents. Among the key evidence missing from the committee proceedings were Ford’s psychotherapy records. Attorneys could seek those records in a defamation suit. Typically they would be protected by the psychiatrist-patient privilege. But Ford appears to have waived that privilege.

Parties aren’t allowed to game the system by revealing just the privileged evidence they think helps their case.

Generally parties cannot use a privilege, such as the attorney-client privilege or psychiatrist-patient-privilege, as both a sword and a shield. That is, a party cannot selectively disclose some privileged communications to support his case but invoke the privilege to avoid disclosing other communications of the same type. Parties aren’t allowed to game the system by revealing just the privileged evidence they think helps their case.

Ford appears to have violated that principle. In September, when the Post interviewed Ford, she said she first revealed the alleged attack from Kavanaugh during a couple’s therapy session in 2012. According to the article, portions of Ford’s therapist’s notes “were provided by Ford and reviewed by The Washington Post.” The Post article also referred to notes from a subsequent, individual therapy session “the following year,” in which Ford discussed a rape attempt in her late teens.

Ford used her psychotherapy notes to give credibility to her accusations by showing she mentioned an alleged attack before Kavanaugh was nominated in 2018. But the rest of her psychotherapy records may also reflect on her credibility. Ford’s attorneys refused to share those records with the Judiciary Committee, claiming they “contain private, highly sensitive information that is not necessary for the Committee to assess the credibility of her testimony.”

That argument likely would not fly in litigation. Ford has already disclosed the psychotherapy records to others. By waiving the privilege, those records would appear to be discoverable in any defamation suit.

As for Other Witnesses and Documents

A defamation suit would also allow the parties’ attorneys to take the depositions of other witnesses and seek other evidence missing from the public record. Such discovery might cover Ford’s communications with politicians and other third-parties and her complete polygraph results. A deposition of Leland Ingham Keyser, the friend Ford says attended the small party where Kavanaugh allegedly attacked her, would also be illuminating.

Attorneys could also seek to learn more about the renovation Ford made to her home. She testified she wanted a second front door added due to the trauma she still suffers from Kavanaugh’s alleged attack. A media report, however, suggests that Ford may have added a door to her home between 2008 and 2010 to create a sub-unit in the house to rent out. Building permits, rental records, and witness testimony might provide valuable insight on this issue.

Solving a Political Enigma

Finally, a defamation case would allow for exploration of Ford’s political commitments, if any. Such evidence would be relevant to whether Ford might have any motive to make a false accusation.

The known timeline raises some questions. Ford explained she referred to an alleged attack by Kavanaugh for the first time ever in May 2012 in a therapy session. That was during Mitt Romney’s presidential run, and just two months after Jeffrey Toobin, on March 26, 2012, published an article on Kavanaugh in The New Yorker. Toobin predicted a disastrous future if Kavanaugh ever joined the Supreme Court.

On May 30, 2012, the same month Ford first revealed the alleged attack in a therapy session, The New York Times wrote about an advocacy group’s aggressive ad campaign targeting Romney. Those ads contended Romney would “deny women access to birth control, abortions and equal pay for the work they do,” presumably based in part on his expected Supreme Court nominations.

On November 5, 2012, between Ford’s first and second therapy sessions mentioning an alleged attack by Kavanaugh, an ad ran on Facebook imagining a world in which Kavanaugh had been appointed to the Supreme Court. The ad contained a Photo-Shopped front page from The New York Times announcing: “High Court Overturns Roe v. Wade 5-4.” Below the headline were pictures of the Supreme Court justices. On the top row left was Kavanaugh.

The fictional Times article explained the Supreme Court majority overturning Roe consisted of Chief Justice Roberts, who joined the court’s “three staunch conservatives and newcomer Justice Kavanaugh” (emphasis added).

When Ford began reaching out to the Post and politicians to share her accusations against Kavanaugh in 2018, was it significant in Ford’s mind that these 2012 political predictions appeared to be playing out? Would Ford have objected to Kavanaugh’s presence on the Supreme Court on ideological grounds even if she had never met him? This might be a relevant subject for inquiry in any defamation suit.

The Judiciary Committee proceedings were not a trial. By their nature, they could not develop a full evidentiary record or give the public an adequate opportunity to evaluate Ford’s accusations against Kavanaugh. But a defamation lawsuit now might do so, allowing both Kavanaugh and Ford the opportunity to seek and produce all of the evidence they believe is relevant. For the public good and the benefit of history, Kavanaugh should seriously consider filing such a suit, and Ford should welcome it.

What Does ‘Good Enough’ Look Like In Afghanistan?,"Afghanistan is back in the headlines again, and as usual, the news isn’t good. Last Thursday, just two days before national elections were scheduled to take place, the Taliban claimed responsibility for an attack that left two top Afghan security officials dead and nearly took the life of America’s top commander in the country. This is just the latest sign that the security situation in Afghanistan, where the United States has been at war for 17 years, is disintegrating.

The question that now faces U.S. policymakers is what can and can’t they live with in Afghanistan. America’s time in the country seems to be running out.

Thursday’s attack took place at a security meeting between Afghan and U.S. officials, including a man who has been instrumental in pushing the Taliban out of Kandahar Province, Abdul Raziq, the police chief. Raziq, along with Kandahar’s intelligence chief, was killed in the attack.

His death is a huge setback for America’s interests in Afghanistan. Raziq was considered a crucial ally in the years-long U.S. effort to eradicate the Taliban. He was well-connected across the region and had a network of informants who helped the U.S. keep tabs on the Taliban threat. Raziq ensured security in southern Afghanistan.

Although Raziq was praised for his role in fighting the Taliban, he was no saint. Raziq has been accused of horrific torture, extrajudicial killings, and “disappearing” people. That, in a nutshell, is America’s recent history in Afghanistan: Working with the best we’ve got, which isn’t all that great. We were actually lucky to have Raziq on our side. His replacement might not be so cooperative, well-connected, or determined to fight the Taliban tooth and nail.

But there was another target of Thursday’s attack: U.S. Gen. Austin Miller, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan. He managed to escape the attack uninjured, but the story could have easily ended differently—a shocking reality in a country America has fought for years to secure.

The Taliban did not want parliamentary elections to take place. In recent weeks, nearly a dozen candidates have been killed, along with many more supporters. One such attack took place the day before the attack in Kandahar, killing one prominent would-be candidate. The group also warned Afghans to stay home from Saturday’s elections, threatening more violence.

But despite the weeks of killings, and Thursday’s devastating attack, people showed up at the polls. Four million, to be exact — about half of the country’s eligible voters. A significant percentage of Afghans do not want to see the Taliban back in power; they want open elections, they want a voice.

That doesn’t necessarily mean they want to vote in the kind of liberal, Western democracy one might imagine. If the Arab Spring taught us anything, it’s that democratic elections in North Africa and the Middle East often lead to the election of simply another variety of autocratic leader.

Nevertheless, while the Taliban didn’t entirely succeed in its efforts—elections still took place, after all—a third of polling stations remained closed and the election in Kandahar was postponed for a week. The Taliban also launched several attacks on Saturday, killing at least 28 Afghans who were trying to vote. What’s more, these elections were already three years past due because of the difficulty in quelling security concerns throughout the country.

Last week’s attack showcases how volatile the security situation still is—and how difficult it is, and always will be, for the United States to secure anything close to a peaceful democracy in that country. America has failed to broker peace with the Taliban, which only wants “peace” on its own terms.

The United States is not going to get its way in Afghanistan. Arguably, it can’t succeed there, if success is defined as defeating the Taliban. We know that after 17 years of war. Afghanistan will be back under Taliban control, at least in part.

The best-case scenario now is that some kind of power-sharing agreement can be reached between the Taliban and the various war lords-turned-politicians and tribal leaders that comprise Afghanistan’s political establishment. Maybe that would include continued U.S. counterterrorism efforts. But will the Taliban be willing? Will they settle for anything less than total control, even if it has to be under the guise of a flimsy coalition?

While we don’t want the Taliban in charge of the country, we also need to ask hard questions about what we’re willing to settle for, what we can live with. The United States can’t stay in Afghanistan forever, trying to secure the country while fighting al-Qaeda and the Islamic State, which persistently have managed to keep a foothold there. So what kind of compromises can we stomach? We’d better start asking ourselves that question.

The reality is that America can’t compete with the Taliban, whose vast networks in communities across Afghanistan have allowed it to reemerge to reclaim more than a third of the country in a resurgence once thought impossible. So what’s it going to be? What will we deem as “good enough”? And what will the Afghan people have to settle for?",https://thefederalist.com/2018/10/22/good-enough-look-like-afghanistan/,2018-10-22
4 Times The Popular Narrative Was Wrong About Terror Attacks,"With less than two weeks before the midterms, it is instructive to remember that the rush to presuppose the culprits and motives behind unsolved terror attacks sometimes leads to blind alleys. The facts of these cases do not always end up following preconceived narratives.

Alexander Soros, the son of major leftist funder George Soros, is among those who blame President Trump for inspiring the recent pipe bomb mailings directed to former vice president Joe Biden, actor Robert De Niro, former President Obama, Hillary Clinton, George Soros, former attorney general Eric Holder, former CIA director John Brennan, and California Rep. Maxine Waters.

One can understand why a son frightened for his father’s safety might lash out at a president who seems to share political enemies with the culprit of these attacks. But the rest of us shouldn’t believe accusations like this without good evidence.

The culprit (or culprits) need to be caught and punished. Period. There’s no political angle to that proposition. History has repeatedly made fools of those who attempt to solve terror attacks based upon narratives. Things are not always what they seem. Here is a list of four times that apparent terror attacks on America ended up not fitting the popular narrative.

1. The 1996 Atlanta Olympics Bombing

As described by Wikipedia, Richard Allensworth Jewell was an American police officer and security guard who discovered a backpack filled with three pipe bombs in the Centennial Olympic Park during the 1996 summer Olympics. Jewell alerted police and helped to evacuate the area before the bomb exploded, saving many people from injury or death.

Three days later, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution revealed that the FBI was treating him as a possible suspect, based largely on a “lone bomber” criminal profile. For the next several weeks, the news media focused aggressively on him as the presumed culprit, labeling him with the ambiguous term “person of interest” and sifting through his life to match a leaked “lone bomber” profile that the FBI had used.

The media, to varying degrees, portrayed Jewell as a failed law enforcement officer who may have planted the bomb so he could “find” it and be a hero. The media frenzy was wrong. The real culprit was Eric Rudolph. The allegations nevertheless destroyed Jewell’s life.

2. The 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing

In 1995 a massive bomb exploded outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killing 168 people. Initially, several news organizations, including CNN, reported that investigators were seeking to question several men, described as being Middle Eastern in appearance, who had driven away from the building shortly before the blast. The real culprits were not connected in any way to Islam or the Middle East.

3. The 2002 DC Sniper

In October 2002, the DC area was terrorized by a shooting spree that claimed ten lives and injured three. On October 3, 2002, a witness spotted a white van or truck speeding from the scene of one of the shootings. The initial FBI profile had law enforcement looking for a white male, 25-40 years old, who was a firefighter or construction worker.

These assumptions were wrong. The real culprit did not drive a box van or truck, was not white, and was not a firefighter or construction worker.

4. The 2001 Anthrax Attacks

Shortly after the 2001 terror attacks on September 11, 2001, letters containing anthrax spores were mailed to several news offices and to Democratic Sens. Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy. Initially the FBI focused on an American physician and virological weapons expert who worked at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases.

The FBI repeatedly raided his house and his phone was tapped. In addition, Attorney General John Ashcroft named Steven Hatfill as a “person of interest” in the investigation on national television. Eventually, however, the federal government was forced to pay Hatfill $4.6 million to settle a lawsuit and issue an official exoneration.

In 2008 the FBI identified Bruce Edward Ivans as the sole perpetrator of the anthrax attacks. Ivans committed suicide before being brought to justice.

To the victims of these apparent latest pipe bomb attacks, I offer my prayers and support. Thank God nobody was hurt. I also offer my thanks and support to law enforcement, whom I suspect are already closing in on the culprit or culprits.

When Sen. Bernie Sanders supporter James Thomas Hodgkinson attempted to shoot several members of Congress, including Steve Scalise, a number of conservatives distinguished themselves by refusing to blame Sanders for the acts of one of his political supporters.

Peter Roff of U.S. News and World Report noted, “It is remarkable therefore that those potentially most affected by this, including President Donald Trump, have been counseling reconciliation and unity. They have not…sought to blame and shame their opposite numbers for creating an environment in which such things are possible.”

Conservative talk show host Sean Hannity said, “There’s always gonna be a crazy in every crowd. The shooting that took place at that baseball game practice, where Steve Scalise was shot, he was a Bernie supporter, but I don’t blame Bernie Sanders for the fact that one of his supporters is a nut.”

Not every conservative can claim the honor of refraining from politicizing the shooting. But history is kind to those who resist this temptation, particularly before the facts are in.

What makes these attacks so puzzling is that they come at a time that the president is trying to emphasize the violence of his political opponents. These attacks undermine that message and do not help the political opponents of the victims. Certainly, of someone who has the broken mental circuitry required to construct and mail pipe bombs, it is not a stretch to imagine that he also lacks rational political instincts.

"When Attacking The Federal Reserve, Trump Actually Attacks Savers","It may have been overshadowed by the focus on domestic terror attacks, but on Tuesday, President Trump made some unhelpful comments on the state of the economy. Specifically, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump called the Federal Reserve Bank the “biggest risk” to the economy.

The Journal reported their interview by stating that the president had “escalated his attacks” on the Fed and its Chairman Jerome Powell, threatening the independence of U.S. monetary policy. The greater problem with his comments lay not in process, but in their substance. By calling for continued “easy money” and low interest rates, the president would damage savers on multiple levels.

Low Interest Rates Hurt Retirees

In the full interview, Trump implied that Barack Obama received an unfair advantage, because interest rates remained near zero for most of his term, helping to accelerate economic growth:

I’m very unhappy with the Fed, because Obama had zero interest rates and I have almost normalized—and maybe normalized, depending on who you’re talking to—interest rates. You give me zero interest rates and you show me my numbers with zero interest rates. He had phony numbers because it was based on zero interest. Well, you know, he had—he had zero interest.

Apart from the obvious fact that presidents do not create economic growth—businesses do—Trump’s comments overlook the nearly decade-long punishment that savers, many of them retirees on fixed incomes, faced during the long spell of zero interest rates.

To put it in perspective, from December 2008, when the Fed lowered rates to near-zero, until December 2015, when the Fed finally began raising rates, the consumer price index rose by 12.5 percent. During that seven-year period, savers not only saw next-to-no return on their nest eggs, they lost 10 to 12 percent of the purchasing power of their money due to inflation.

In many cases, savers faced a double whammy. Some lost sizable sums in the stock market crash that preceded the Great Recession. Then, when they moved their much-reduced savings into safer assets, those safer assets effectively lost even more money in real (i.e., after-inflation) terms, because interest rates remained so low for so long.

New retirees who purchased annuities during the period of near-zero interest rates suffered worst of all. Because an annuity bases its payout rate on interest rates at the time of purchase, individuals who bought annuities during the Great Recession got very little bang for their buck. That is, because their money would not make much money while being saved in the annuity, they would receive much-reduced payouts every month.

Trump criticized Powell, saying “it almost looks like he’s happy raising interest rates.” But as a saver, I am thrilled every time the Fed has raised interest rates—I hope they do so again, as expected, during their December meeting. It means my savings are finally making more than zero-point-one percentage point interest. Millions of people, many of them retirees and therefore a key Trump demographic, agree.

Inflation: A Tax On Savings

In his interview, Trump rationalized his call for lower interest rates, by claiming that “there’s not [inflation] of any consequence.” If inflation returned, the president claimed, he’d “even do it [raise interest rates] more.”

But Trump’s claim underestimates the causes of inflation lurking around every corner. Unemployment stands at record low levels, which could easily bleed through to higher wages, and ultimately higher prices. Both tax relief and record levels of federal spending have provided additional fiscal stimulus. Rising tariffs will ultimately result in higher prices for goods.

Trump may also underestimate the pernicious effects of higher inflation when it does arrive. Inflation helped precipitate the largest recession since the Great Depression, in the early 1980s. Loose monetary policy during the 1970s, prompted in part by political pressure from President Richard Nixon, led to inflation throughout the decade. Decisive action by Paul Volcker, who became the Fed chairman in 1979, eventually broke the back of inflation, but not before sparking a major economic downturn in the process.

Margaret Thatcher, a grocer’s daughter, instinctively understood the harm that inflation brings to savers, eroding their life savings. When campaigning in 1979, she posed for a famous picture showing two bags of groceries—one from the start of the Labour government, and one from its end—to show how five years of Labour policies had reduced the value of “the pound in your pocket.”

Wall Street Versus Main Street

Unfortunately, the president may come at the interest rate issue from an entirely different perspective than Thatcher. The property magnate and self-proclaimed “King of Debt” may actually support higher inflation precisely because it reduces the value of loans, making them easier to repay.

But while Wall Street firms and real estate tycoons, who use debt as a matter of course in their transactions, support lower interest rates and higher inflation, the average American saver does not. If Trump wants to support the millions of Americans who save, not to mention the millions of retirees who voted for him, he should let the Fed continue on its course, rather than punishing savers who live on fixed incomes.

Iran’s Hits On Western Soil Reveal Establishment Hypocrisy,"While America is often insulated from the most malign of Iran’s activities, even if only by dint of our distant geographic position, the brazen and bellicose mullocracy has reminded us of its global reach at a pivotal time. This global reach extends from our Transatlantic allies, to our southern neighbors and our own shores. Clearly, Iran feels it perfectly acceptable to carry out murderous acts here in the West with impunity.

This all should only underscore the need to counter the Khomeinist regime using every element of national power at all points of leverage. The political establishment’s silence in the face of this threat — if not its urging to engage further economically with Iran while punishing its foes in spite of the calamitous consequences of that very policy during the Obama years — is stunning.

For the latest evidence of Iran’s audacious aggression, America need look no further than Europe. There, Iranian hit squads, in part under diplomatic cover, have been exposed for plotting a string of assassinations in what seems to be a concerted campaign to take out the ayatollahs’ political rivals in exile, among other foes.

The latest evidence of this effort comes mere days before U.S. sanctions are set to “snapback” on Iran in strategically significant sectors like shipping, energy and finance. Some Europeans have resisted these very sanctions. But do not hold your breath waiting for the media and political establishment to harp on these attempted hits. This is Iran after all, not Saudi Arabia.

According to the Associated Press, in September 2018, Denmark’s national security service foiled an alleged assassination plot directed by Iranian intelligence against a leader of the Danish wing of a militant Iranian separatist group called the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahwaz (ASMLA). This follows the 2017 murder of the founder of the ASMLA, Ahmad Mola Nissi, in The Hague at the hands of an “unidentified assailant.” Dutch authorities reportedly expelled two Iranian diplomats who may have been linked to the Nissi assassination.

ASMLA consists of Ahwazi Arabs, a small minority in Persian-dominated Iran, who desire independence, and according to Amnesty International are subject to severe repression. ASMLA has engaged in violent acts against the Iranian regime, including attacks on energy infrastructure in Iran’s oil-rich Khuzestan province, where Ahwazis predominate, and against the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).

ASMLA was implicated — at least by the Iranians — in an armed ambush of a military parade just days before the Danish assassination plot was foiled, killing more than 20 people. Their alleged connection to that attack is unclear. Iran has since further cracked down on the Awhazi population. In the wake of the alleged ASMLA ambush, the Islamic Republic also recalled the envoys of Denmark, Great Britain, and the Netherlands for supposedly harboring ASMLA, which it lists as a terrorist group.

It appears Western governments disagree with this designation. Danish authorities had reportedly been protecting the ASMLA leader targeted by the Iranians for months because of threats to his safety. Israel’s Mossad supposedly provided critical intelligence that enabled Denmark to scuttle the attack. Denmark’s Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen tweeted after the plot was revealed: “It is totally unacceptable that Iran or any other foreign state plans assassinations on Danish soil. Further actions against Iran will be discussed in the EU.”

It is clear the Danes did not consider this some kind of justifiable Iranian counterterror operation. Meanwhile, ASMLA’s branch in the Netherlands appears to operate openly. The United States does not designate ASMLA as a foreign terrorist organization. It is telling that Iran has denied the plot allegations as “biased” and “anti-Iran,” while threatening Denmark over taking “ill-advised and controversial actions,” rather than even trying to level a propagandistic argument that it was pursuing a terrorist organization abroad, as Western nations do.

Meanwhile, this past summer, Iranian intelligence allegedly plotted an attack on an event outside Paris attended by thousands, including notable American political figures such as Newt Gingrich and Rudy Giuliani. The rally was organized by The National Council of Resistance of Iran, and backed by the Iran-hated Mujahedin-e-Khalq (MEK) opposition group. The foiled plot resulted in four arrests, including that of an Iranian diplomat stationed in Austria.

MEK, which is dedicated to overthrowing Iran’s mullocratic regime and establishing a “secular republic,” used to be designated as a terrorist group by many Western governments. Those designations were lifted in the EU, United States, and Canada between 2009 and 2012. In March, Albanian authorities arrested two Iranian nationals on terrorism charges — purportedly threatening MEK — after they were caught allegedly carrying out reconnaissance on a location prior to the Iranian Nowruz New Year celebration.

Iran’s unwillingness to take responsibility for these operations betrays its full knowledge that it is acting illegitimately, not just fighting militants, living up to its name as the world’s leading state sponsor of terror. Iran’s assassinations abroad of course extend well beyond just seeking to pick off threats to the dictatorship’s power. In January, German police conducted raids across the nation in pursuit of 10 alleged IRGC Qods Force intelligence officials spying on Israeli and Jewish targets.

Back in 2012, Hezbollah operatives allegedly blew up a bus at the Burgas airport, killing 5 Israelis and the Bulgarian bus driver and injuring 32 more Israelis. Highly curiously, in spite of Bulgarian authorities’ original attribution of the attack to Hezbollah, and of substantial evidence supporting that claim, the prosecutor of that case has now excluded Hezbollah from the indictment, perhaps indicating fear of further Iranian bloodshed. Such Iran-linked plots in Europe stretch back 40 years.

Perhaps most brazenly of all attempted Iranian attacks on political opponents in the West in recent memory is the alleged Quds Force-backed plot to bomb the then-Saudi ambassador to the United States, Adel al-Jubeir, at Georgetown eatery Café Milano in 2011. There is also disastrous competition for Iranian carnage in our hemisphere, when one considers the 1994 AMIA bombing. Needless to say, behind the bespectacled, Cheshire cat-like, seemingly urbane Iranian officials who face the West, lies a regime that has no qualms about murdering its perceived rivals abroad.

At home, the Khomeinist mullocracy is responsible for pervasive human rights abuses and violently suppressing political dissent (even taking Washington Post journalists hostage), and holds the dubious distinction of ranking number one in the world in per capita executions. It seeks to expand its Islamic Revolution and subdue rival regimes not only by threats, proxy wars and jihad, but also by cyberattacks and information warfare.

“Death to Israel,” followed closely by “Death to America,” form the unifying ethos of Iran’s Islamic totalitarian theocracy. Stated succinctly, Iran combines the brutal savagery and repression of the Saudis, with the subversion and destabilization emphasis of the Russians and the Jew-hatred of the neo-Nazis – with its hands drenched in the blood of hundreds of Americans dating back over the almost 40 years since the overthrow of the Shah and the taking of U.S. hostages at our embassy in Tehran.

Yet in the wake of l’affaire Khashoggi, Russiagate and the neo-Nazi attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue, there is no such widespread call for challenging Iran. On the contrary, the badgering by the likes of former Obama national security advisor Susan Rice, representative of our progressive media and political establishment, to push Saudi Arabia’s Muhammad bin Salman (MBS) aside as our number one priority in the Middle East would lead to the very chaos that would benefit none other than the Saudi’s sworn enemy, Iran.

Of course, making Iran the Middle East hegemon while empowering the “political Islamist” Muslim Brotherhood was always the desire of the Obamaites, many in the foreign policy establishment, and certainly their like-minded lackeys in the media. Perhaps more baffling is that Jason Rezaian, the Iranian-American former Tehran bureau chief of the Washington Post, who was arrested and held prisoner for a year-and-a-half by the Khomeinist mullocracy, yet argues, “Instead of isolating Iran and its people any further, I say embrace them.”

This coddling of Iran and chiding of its foes is inexplicable from the perspective of American national interest, given only Iran poses an imminent, direct threat to America and her allies, not just on the streets of Berlin or Paris, but in Latin America and on U.S. soil. In fact, as we fast approach the re-imposition of sanctions on the Iranian regime, there are indications that the Khomeinists will directly threaten if not outright attack America and her assets.

Those who continue to adhere to the Iran appeasement agenda while attacking its foes and giving other equally brutal and detrimental regimes a free pass should be asked the following questions regarding Tehran:

If you believe in the imperative to punish dictators who threaten human rights, why do you steadfastly oppose exerting maximum economic pressure to hamstring such a regime? If you believe in preserving Western civilization, why are you willing to sell it out to a mullocracy that threatens to murder citizens on your own soil? If you believe in the necessity to fight anti-Semitism, why would you appease and enable supremacist fanatics dedicated to destruction of the Jewish state?

Our Wilsonian internationalist national security and foreign policy establishment owes us an explanation for why, given the history of tyranny, bloodshed, and anti-Americanism, its faithful are so devoted to making their bed with Khomeinists on the Shia side and Muslim Brotherhood members and Islamist fellow travelers on the Sunni side. Either the establishment should treat all such regressive powers with equal contempt and aggressiveness, or it should admit it plays favorites, and tell us why its favorites happen to be the most hostile of all towards America.

More pressingly, the foregoing underscores the danger posed by an Iran evidently willing to engage in assassinations around the world, an Iran likely to grow increasingly desperate and thus dangerous as sanctions starve it for cash. The answer to Iran’s aggression is not to appease it — which only rewards aggression — but to meet it with overwhelming strength and an indomitable will.

Watch Crenshaw Smash Claims Of Trump 'Undermining Democracy',"Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” representative-elect Dan Crenshaw calmly exposed the bankruptcy of wild and never-ending claims that President Trump is a threat to democracy, enemy of the press, fascist dictator, yadda yadda yadda.

Another incoming representative, Joe Neguse (D-Colo.), claimed on the show that, “Some of our democratic freedoms and the principles that we live by have been under attack for the better part of two years.”

“What democratic freedoms have been undermined?” Crenshaw (R-Texas) responded. “We just had an election where we switched power in the House, democracy is at work, people are voting in record numbers.” Crenshaw said whenever people make “this broad-brush criticism that the president is somehow undermining democracy,” he wants to hear examples of what they mean.

The entire panel erupted. Incoming freshman Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-Penn.) listed off “judiciary, CIA, FBI, the voting process” and “undermining the free press,” which Neguse echoed.

“How has he done that?” Crenshaw asked. “The Obama administration had many press members under investigation, Trump has not, so what is the difference here?”

Neguse then mentioned the White House’s revocation of Jim Acosta’s press credentials after Acosta swatted away a White House intern trying to retrieve his mic. He characterized it as CNN “having to go to court to essentially regain access to the [White House] press room.”

""This broad brush criticism that the president is somehow undermining our democracy, I always wonder like, what exactly are we talking about?"" @DanCrenshawTX tells @margbrennan @FaceTheNation https://t.co/ac7ve4LCfw pic.twitter.com/u9QPUmwMMl — Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) November 18, 2018

“That was one reporter, not the whole organization,” Crenshaw pointed out. “… Because he was disruptive.”

“I would argue that our president is consistently disruptive in those very same press conferences,” Houlahan interjected, “And I would argue that he treats them with disrespect.”

“But how is that an attack on the press though?” Crenshaw asked.

“Because it’s literally an attack on the press –” Houlahan began. Crenshaw interrupted: “I’ve been literally attacked, so let’s choose our words carefully.”

“His language is an attack,” said Houlahan.

“Okay, so why is he not allowed to use his own language and freedom of speech?” Crenshaw asked.

“Because it’s important that we lead by example, that we lead from the top,” responded Houlahan.

“I agree with you there. Style is one thing. If you want to criticize style, I’m with you,” Crenshaw said. “But to say it’s an attack on the freedom of the press, that is a very bold statement.”",https://thefederalist.com/2018/11/19/watch-dan-crenshaw-beat-medias-wild-hyperbole-trump-undermining-democracy/,2018-11-19
WaPo Claims There's A 'Surge' In Right-Wing Terrorism. There Isn't,"A new Washington Post “analysis” of domestic terrorism argues that attacks from white supremacists and other “far-right attackers” have been on the rise since Barack Obama’s presidency, and “surged since President [Donald] Trump took office.” It’s a familiar storyline meant to assure liberals that, yes, Trump-motivated right-wing terrorists are running wild. There are, however, a few problems with this proposition.

For one thing, even if we accept the numbers the Post offers, the use of the word “surge” — meaning a sudden, powerful forward or upward movement — strains credibility. There’s no evidence of a “surge” either in historical context or as a matter of ideological preference. But even if we’re okay with replacing “uptick” with the word “surge,” a cynic might note that the Post’s reporters seem to filibuster their own findings to push preconceived partisan notions about the state of the nation.

That is to say, we have good reason not to accept the numbers. According to The Washington Post, which relies on Global Terrorism Database (GTD) data, there were allegedly zero — not one — acts of right-wing terrorism in the entire nation in the year 2002. Since then we have seen a “surge” to 36 in a nation of 325-plus million people by 2017. Among those acts, there were 11 fatalities.

Or, in other words, fewer homicides were committed by political terrorists of any stripe in the United States in 2017 than were committed by illegal immigrants in the state of Texas alone — which I am assured is an incredibly low number that shouldn’t worry us very much. If one of these is scaremongering, why not the other?

Then again, even if we use the criteria offered by GTD, we need to be exceptionally generous to even get to 36 incidents of right-wing violence in 2017 (I could only find 32).

For example, although the Post acknowledges that the Las Vegas shooter’s motivations are still unknown, the CTD had no problem categorizing the murderer of 59 people as an “anti-government extremist.” And it takes these sorts of assumptions to get in the vicinity of a “surge” in right-wing terrorism.

Of the 32 incidents I was able to find, 12 featured perpetrators who were merely “suspected” of being right-wing terrorists. Some of these incidents could have been the work of one person, as in the pellet-gun shootings of Muslims in New York. In other incidents, we are asked to treat patently insane people as if they have coherent political agendas. In still others, the attacks could easily have non-terroristic motivating factors.

Still other events are even more opaque. In San Juan, Puerto Rico — apparently a hotbed of white supremacy — an incendiary device was thrown into a gay night club. No one was injured, thankfully. Also, no one was caught and no one claimed responsibility for the act. The episode doesn’t even earn a “suspected” designation from GTD. And the Washington Post almost surely added this to its right-wing terror stats.

If the definition of domestic terrorism is muddy at best, the definition of “right-wing” terrorism is often arbitrary and self-serving. To help bolster right-wing terrorist stats, for instance, we would have to perfunctorily include every anti-Semitic act. The Washington Post even mentions an Anti-Defamation League (ADL) study showing “a 57 percent surge in anti-Semitic incidents in 2017.”

If anything, the ADL study is the kind of cautionary document demonstrating how difficult it is, not only to quantify these incidents, but to categorize them ideologically. The ADL’s faulty data was self-reported, and most of the “surge” can be attributed to a single Jewish teen in Israel calling in a number of bomb threats to Jewish centers.

In the real world, a Jewish American is probably more likely to encounter anti-Semitism at a college campus or progressive march in the guise of “anti-Zionism” than he is anywhere else, because Jew hatred is non-partisan.

Then there is the matter of inconsistently defining terrorism. If throwing a rock through the window of an Islamic center is an act of right-wing terrorism, why isn’t it an act of left-wing terrorism for anti-capitalists to throw rocks through the window of a business in Portland? Surely both fall under the description of terror, which is “the threatened or actual use of violence by nonstate actors seeking to attain political, economic, religious or social goals through fear or intimidation.” As far as I can tell, only one of these genres makes the cut at GTD.

Even if we were to accept the numbers, The Post decided to bury the lede. According to their own data, there were more fatalities due to domestic Islamist terrorism than to all other types combined over the past three years. In 2017, there were 16 fatalities due to Islamic extremism. Fatalities from Islamic terrorism in 2016 — which includes 49 killed in a gay Orlando nightclub by an ISIS-inspired jihadi — and 2015 were higher than all alleged right-wing terror attacks. There’s just as strong a case to be made that there has been a “surge” in Islamic terrorism in the United States since Donald Trump ran for president.

Then again, none of the three authors of the article take the time to mention a single one of those Islamic attacks. So while we learn that Trump is being blamed for a pipe bomb being thrown “yards” away from an Islamic enter by the “White Rabbit 3 Percent Illinois Patriot Freedom Fighters Militia,” we read nothing about the man who pledged his allegiance to ISIS before killing eight people on the West Side Highway in Manhattan.

This is what happens when reporters work backwards from a predetermined premise.

You’ll notice, as well, that these analyses typically begin in 2002, since the 2,996 Americans murdered in 2001 is inconvenient to the white-supremacy-is-more-dangerous-than-radical-Islam narrative. The reason we don’t have a real-life “surge” of Islamist attacks since 2001, incidentally, is that the United States has spent billions yearly to stop it.

Political violence isn’t the monopoly of any one group. Although there have been flare-ups of leftist violence in the 1900s and late 1960s-1970s—and other domestic acts of terror before and since—for the most part this kind of violence is still rare. That could change. And none of this is to say horrible events aren’t happening. Nor is it to say that haters don’t exist. But exaggerating the problem for political reasons doesn’t help anyone. Covering your partisan work with a bogus veneer of scientific analysis doesn’t make it any more useful.

Why Putin’s Game Of Russian Roulette With Ukraine Is A Big Deal,"In a stunning sequence of events, the Russian military opened fire then seized three Ukrainian navy vessels in an unprovoked attack on the Black Sea last Sunday. In the melee, several Ukrainian sailors were wounded and 24 captured. Moscow followed up this flagrant act of war by parading the sailors on Russian television to give clearly coerced confessions of guilt.

This attack is but the latest escalation in the ongoing Russian war against Ukraine that has been churning since 2014. It’s also the first great test for the Trump administration regarding Russia and one that will have lasting consequences on the future of Europe and the world.

Moscow’s Strategy Of Ambiguity

The war in Ukraine began in 2014 after Russian special forces seized Crimea. The tactic Moscow used is what I dubbed, in U.S. Army publications, “the strategy of ambiguity.” Putin directed that his troops remove all symbols and anything else that would identify them as Russian soldiers.

This had the desired effect, as American journalists breathlessly reported of the ridiculously labeled “little green men” from unknown origins taking control of Crimea. President Obama and the rest of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies wrung their hands on what to do. The tactic worked––as President Obama dithered, Russia seized Crimea within a week without firing a shot in anger.

The takeover of Crimea was quickly followed by local referenda to ascertain if Crimea desired to become part of Russia––a vote, of course, that overwhelmingly supported the idea. The deal was sealed just a month after the little green men seized the country, with Putin announcing that Crimea would be annexed by Russia.

His speech was given to the Duma (Russia’s parliament) with much fanfare, but had chilling similarities to another dark time in history. Putin proclaimed that it was his duty and responsibility to protect ethnic Russians wherever they reside. This begs the question: how far geographically does his ethnic-based strategy extend?

Although Putin’s war against Ukraine is going into its fourth year, there has been a disconcerting pattern of aggression from him for more than a decade. The first test was an all-out cyber attack against NATO member Estonia in 2007, attributable to Russia. The attack was launched by Moscow in retaliation for Estonia’s decision to move a Soviet-era war shrine out of the center of its capital, Tallinn, after it became a hotbed of ethnic Russian unrest. The cyber attack punished Estonia for not heeding Moscow’s demands not to move the monument.

The next test came in 2008, when Russia launched a massive invasion of the nation of Georgia, which had most of its small army deployed in Iraq fighting an American war. When the guns fell silent, Moscow formally annexed two large swaths of Georgian territory, South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

Encouraged by the lack of resolve in the United States and its allies, Moscow followed up in 2014 with the invasion and annexation of Crimea, and with Putin’s now-infamous speech of ethnic expansionism. President Obama faltered in the face of the Russian aggression and failed to do anything substantive to deter further aggression.

Putin’s Quiet War

Buoyed by this appeasement and weakness, Putin took the next bold step of exporting an ethnic Russian uprising in eastern Ukraine. That war has droned on now for four years, leaving behind 10,000 dead and a rebel force largely in Luhansk and Donetsk with more tanks (compliments of Moscow) than the German army has in its inventory. The Ukrainians have done well in blunting the Moscow-led, -planned, and -orchestrated attack on their nation, but at a high cost in lives and treasure.

Putin’s problem is that, at this point, he needs to avoid a direct confrontation with the United States and NATO. He is in a precarious position economically and his military is still two years from completing part of its modernization and overhaul. Moscow has found in the latest rounds of aggression that using a fabricated proxy force in Ukraine as a cover to provide plausible deniability that it’s truly behind the conflict. This is what makes the Russian naval attack on Ukraine significant. It is the first overt and direct confrontation between Moscow and Kiev since 2014.

The stalemate in Eastern Ukraine is costly to Putin financially and politically. When Moscow deployed its special forces and intelligence operatives into Donesk and Luhansk in early 2014, by all accounts, Russia expected a quick victory by the “rebels” who would then ask to be incorporated into greater Russia. This did not happen and Ukraine’s armed forces have been able to prevent Moscow from declaring any sort of victory there.

It seems that the Russian navy attack in the Black Sea is another avenue to bring Ukraine to its knees, by severing its access to the Kerch Straits and the Azov Sea. Putin has slowly strangled Kiev’s lifeline to this vital area over the past months by limiting the number of vessels that could pass through the straits where 25 percent of Ukrainian exports flow to the west and elsewhere.

The Russian attack on the Ukrainian navy this past Sunday is Putin’s pretext to seal off the Kerch Straits from all Ukrainian shipping, and will bring Kiev to its knees economically. The move is a brilliant one for Moscow. By taking this “indirect approach,” Putin will be in a position to break the Ukrainians economically and outflank them militarily by sea east of Crimea.

Appeasement Only Emboldens Expansionist Leaders

The lesson of the past is that appeasement and accommodation only emboldens expansionist leaders. Putin pressed the West for more than a decade and faced tepid responses. If this latest provocation by Putin remains unchallenged, the Ukrainian economy will collapse, and the relative stalemate on its eastern front will result in a Russian breakthrough. The simple fact is that Kiev cannot maintain its forces there with the disintegration of its economy or being entirely cut off from the Sea of Azov.

This need not be an American war; Ukraine can fight and win it with the right policy and tools at its disposal. In the short term, the United States and NATO should increase its supply of Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine to tip the scales back into balance in the land battle. Additionally, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles should be provided to Kiev to defend against this latest Russian provocation.

Furthermore, all NATO countries, especially Germany, must cease purchasing Russian oil and gas. Europe’s addiction to Moscow’s energy has made them unwilling and unable to take a determined stand against Putin’s expanding torrent of aggression in the region. This explains Angela Merkel’s consistently tepid response to Russian aggression––Merkel needs Russian oil and gas, and any interruption of it would have catastrophic results for Germany’s economy.

Since most of Western Europe spends barely 1 percent of their GDP on defense, they owe it to the United States to build liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals on the North Sea and pay a little extra to import American energy. It is madness to enrich a leader in Russia who spends that revenue to create a military force that threatens European security. Once Europe is weaned off Russian energy, an effective economic embargo can be implemented that will discourage Russia from behaving badly.

We Must Not Tolerate This

It is time to draw the line in the sand and not tolerate this provocation. President Trump is facing his first test from Putin and must come out with an unequivocal statement condemning Moscow for its blatant aggression against Ukraine, then follow it up with concerted action.

Putin is a regional bully who only understands strength. America is being tested, both in its commitment to the European alliance and its resolve to maintain the international order. Failure to act will result in the collapse of Ukraine’s economy and rout of its forces on its eastern front. If this happens, the spark of freedom there will be snuffed out yet again by Russian imperialism.

It is imperative that the United States and the entire NATO membership stand unified against Putin’s “ethnic-Russian” ambitions in Europe and meet any further challenges with concerted action and force. If the United States falters, expect Russia to test NATO’s resolve in the Baltics, especially Estonia and Latvia, both of which have large ethnic Russian populations.

This would be a show-changer for the United States, as these nations are NATO members and, under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, we are obligated to come to their aid if they are attacked. How such a war would look I address extensively in a publicly available document called Project 1721.

But it need not come to this. Putin can be stopped in Ukraine, and if he is stopped there, we will have averted a global war and given Europe another generation of peace.

The Nigerian Government Enables Islamic Terrorism Against Christians,"Although it has occasionally made headlines due to the rise of the violent Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram in its northern hinterland, Nigeria is still largely misunderstood and major events in the country remain under-reported in the American media. There are significant U.S. values and strategic interests at stake in Nigeria’s forthcoming election, including questions about the persecution of Christians, the future of U.S. military cooperation in Nigeria, and the spread of Islamist terrorism.

Nigeria is Africa’s largest democracy, with approximately 200 million people and expected to grow to more than 300 million by 2050. The country has long had a history of religious tension and conflict between the mostly Muslim north and predominately Christian south.

This conflict has intensified over the past several decades, engendered by the rise of a new radical Islamism, which has preached a brutal campaign of international holy war against unbelievers. In recent months, Nigeria has witnessed shocking anti-Christian violence, resulting in thousands of deaths and maimings.

Americans Largely Ignorant About What’s Happening

Few Americans are aware that the United States is in the process of selling a dozen light attack aircraft to the government of current President Muhammadu Buhari––a government that has continually soft-peddled and enabled a campaign of violence and ethnic cleansing carried out by Islamic militants against Nigeria’s Christian population.

This new radicalism was initially fueled by the ideology of groups like Al Qaeda, whose influence began to expand rapidly after the end of the Cold War. The ideology reached Nigeria in the form of Boko Haram, the radical Islamist group that made international headlines in 2015 when it kidnapped more than 200 school girls and publicly pledged its allegiance to the infamous and barbaric Islamic State.

The Islamist campaign against nonbelievers in the country hasn’t been limited to Boko Haram’s activities. Nigeria’s middle belt region (which serves as a de facto border region between its Christian and Muslim populations) has seen a running campaign of murder and intimidation against the Christian community there.

The campaign of religious murder has long been marketed by much of Nigeria’s leadership, particularly by its current president, as little more than a petty, mafia-style conflict between Fulani tribesmen, who are predominantly herdsmen, and Christian farmers over rights to grazing land. This approach, led by the current Buhari, downplays the significance of the violence. The violence is predominantly of a religious nature, with Christians being targeted for extermination by radical Islamists, as the Nigerian pastor Hassan John recently reported in the Wall Street Journal :

Boko Haram, a radical Islamic movement whose name roughly translates to ‘Western education is forbidden,’ has ramped up attacks on Christians this year. Since 2009 when Boko Haram began its rampage, about 20,000 Nigerians have been hacked with machetes or shot. Two million have been displaced. Pastors and their families have been specifically targeted for death…Pastors in northern and central Nigeria face daunting pressures. Some conduct funerals almost every week for victims, often in mass burials. They struggle to answer their parishioners’ questions about God’s love and justice. They hear powerful voices dismiss this as an ethnic clash, but they understand it is a strategic scorched-earth war, a jihad against Christianity.’

Who Is Muhammadu Buhari?

Buhari has sought to downplay the violence caused by Boko Haram-linked Islamist militants in the region. This policy of soft peddling the jihadi campaign of aggression against Nigeria’s Christians may be in Buhari’s personal and political interest. It makes arms sales and foreign support easier to obtain, and Buhari is a member of the very tribe that has been largely responsible for the anti-Christian violence.

Buhari’s tribe, the Fulani, have, according to a comprehensive report by World Watch Monitor, become a kind of nomadic vanguard for the spread of Islamic militancy and terror in Nigeria:

‘Herdsmen terrorism’ in Africa always needs to be seen in the context of Uthman Dan Fodio’s war of jihad: ‘Allah prescribed the jihad upon us in order to remove us from the harm which arises from leaning towards an impure world and clinging to its things which actually amount to nothing and the only benefit from it is regret.’… The transformation of the nomadic Sufis into guerrilla fighters, army commanders and even state leaders resulted from the ideology espoused by Ibn Taymiyya that jihad was not only a struggle for personal spiritual reformation but also a struggle against the degradation of the Islamic faith and those causing it, either Muslims or foreigners…Today’s nomads use sophisticated weapons, and in Nigeria, there has been a resurgence of violent conflict and Islamic jihad perpetrated by Muslim nomads belonging to the Hausa-Fulani group. Some have settled in the Middle Belt region, particularly Southern Kaduna, and some are migratory from across the Sahel.

Buhari was initially the military dictator of Nigeria during the 1980s, leading a regime known for its strict discipline and frequent human rights abuses. He rose to power once again during the 2015 presidential election in which he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan on a platform of anti-corruption and a vow to crush the Boko Haram insurgency.

Although Buhari’s opposition to Boko Haram seems to be at least partially genuine, he has also consistently supported the imposition of Sharia law in the country’s north and has had to continually shrug off rumors that he is a crypto-Islamist. These persistent suspicions have long earned him the distrust of much of Nigeria’s Christian population.

The Imposition Of Sharia Law

Although usually associated with brutal regimes in the Middle East like Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, or the Islamic State, sharia has seen a resurgence in Nigeria’s Muslim-dominated northern provinces since 1999 and has been expanded to include both civil and criminal cases. Although in theory only applicable to Muslims, sharia’s legitimization by the government has emboldened Islamist forces in north Nigeria, some of whom have established roving gangs who seek to impose sharia codes on Muslims and non-Muslims alike.

This has created a climate of terror and fear among Nigeria’s Christians. The country’s Christian population have the dual agony of finding themselves facing the guns and machetes of anti-Christian vigilantes and criminals, but also of having their pleas for help and protection dismissed by a Muslim president who publicly calls their plight a local “ethnic conflict.”

Bloomberg reports that conditions have grown so bad that the United Nations issued a statement about a recent spate of violence that left more than 90 people dead in a matter of days. If it is allowed to continue, such violence may even endanger local food supplies and potentially lead to the risk of famine, as farmers may simply be too afraid to harvest their crops.

Just this week a U.K. aid group, the Humanitarian Aid Relief Trust (HART), released a report into the crisis affecting Christians following an in-country investigation. HART reports:

As recently as 1 October, four people including a soldier were killed by Fulani herders in Nkiendoro village, Plateau State. As with other similar attacks, the village was remote and vulnerable. Herders used sophisticated weaponry, forcing families to flee their homes and farmland. Two churches were burned, 17 water pumps were demolished, and 47 farms were cut and destroyed.” HART concludes its report by stating even though the “causes of violence are complex, the asymmetry and escalation of attacks by well-armed Fulani upon predominately Christian communities is stark and must be acknowledged.

In spite of the ongoing campaign of Islamist violence and terror against Nigeria’s Christians––and in spite of Buhari’s soft-pedaling and enabling of it all––the Trump administration has decided to go through with a $500 million sale of a dozen Super Tucano light attack aircraft to the Nigerian government, ostensibly to fight Boko Haram.

Buhari’s government has, for years, sought to obtain the aircraft, but the sale was blocked by the Obama administration due to concerns about atrocities carried out by Nigerian government troops, which included : “committing extrajudicial killings, torture, rape, arbitrary detention, and widespread violence.” In addition, Nigeria’s air force has carried out reckless airstrikes in the past, including one which managed to kill over 100 innocent civilians.

Although it is propeller-driven and, at first glance, seems to more resemble a vintage World War II fighter plane than most of today’s modern military fighter jets, the Super Tucano’s potential lethality, including against civilians, should not be underestimated . Designed as an effective, low-cost alternative to the expensive operating costs of modern, high-tech jet aircraft, it has carved out a niche as a go-to counter-insurgency aircraft in the global arms market. In Afghanistan, the Super Tucano is now being employed by the Afghan air force to attack insurgents with rockets, bombs, cannons and now even laser guided bombs.

Is Wall Street Financing Christian Terror?

There is growing alarm over state-sponsored involvement in the killing of Christians. Report after report suggests some level of involvement by the Nigerian military. In September , armed Fulani herdsmen accompanied by Nigerian soldiers slaughtered 17 Christians, including four children. The attack took place near the Rukuba Barracks, an army cantonment.

In 2015 , soldiers killed six Christians, who had mounted a temporary roadblock during a church service. In a more serious attack, 35 people were killed by the Nigerian military’s air raids on villages in January. Witnesses described the jets bombing houses, as well as specifically targeting civilians trying to escape the carnage.

In a statement by Amnesty International , the human rights group says by failing to act, Nigerian authorities are encouraging impunity that is only causing the violence to escalate. For example, the Buhari administration refused to intervene on behalf of five Christians sentenced to death by a court in Adamawa for killing a herdsman.

While violence in any form is deplorable, the current Nigerian government is willing to look the other way while Christians are murdered, yet won’t intervene to protect Christians. This conflict is growing, claiming 1,800 lives this year alone. Armed Fulani groups have now surpassed Boko Haram jihadists as the deadliest threat to civilians.

These developments pose troubling questions for Wall Street financial institutions as the Nigerian government seeks more than $2.86 billion in Eurobonds to fund government operations. Leading Wall Street banks like Citibank and Standard Chartered are the lead underwriters for the bond offering. Last week, the Nigerian government went on a roadshow in London selling this bond. Unfortunately, not on the agenda of these banks was a full account of the slaughter of thousands of Nigerian Christians.

Perhaps this is about to change. Just before Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of African Affairs Tibor Nagy arrived in Nigeria recently for an official visit, Rep. Mark Meadows (an ally of President Trump) wrote to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo with concerns about “reports of ongoing persecution of Christians in the Middle Belt region of Nigeria.”

Buhari’s government has shown consistent contempt and disregard toward its Christian population, despite the appalling violence committed against them. It has enabled the rise of elements, including radical Islamists, who strike at the heart of the core values of U.S. foreign and domestic policymaking. It now seeks weapons from the United States, with Trump’s blessing, and financing from Wall Street to carry on its morally bankrupt campaign against Christians. The situation in Nigeria deserves far more scrutiny than it currently receives.

Jihadist Beheader In Oklahoma Cleared For Execution,"This fall, the U.S. Supreme Court essentially cemented the execution of America’s least known Islamic terrorist. Jihadist convert Alton Nolen is now set to be put to death in Oklahoma, likely by nitrogen gas inhalation.

The Supreme Court’s October 1, 2018 rejection of Nolen’s final death penalty appeal went unremarked upon by news media so, partly as a result, I missed it. But the Nolen case is very much worth remembering, along with all terror attacks that occur on U.S. soil, if not just for the victims and their survivors but for lessons that can and must be learned.

The September 24, 2014 attack in Oklahoma is somewhat notable in the annals of many officially uncalled terrorist strikes in that Nolen emulated a favorite ISIS death tactic no doubt learned online: he fully beheaded a co-worker—the beloved wife, mother, and grandmother Colleen Hufford—inside the Moore, Oklahoma food processing plant where they both worked. Shouting “Alluah Akbar” throughout the attack, Nolen used the same oversized butcher knife on the neck of a second co-worker, Tracy Johnson, when the company’s chief operations officer, a reserve law enforcement officer named Mark Vaughn, burst in with an AR-15 rifle. He shot and wounded Nolen as Nolen disengaged from his second victim and charged at him with the bloody knife.

Such an attack must generate a particular horror in its witnesses and, when Nolen is finally put to death, one should keep in mind what Hufford must have experienced in her last moments.

The Benefits of Calling Terror Attacks ‘Terror Attacks’

Rather than to call this an Islamic terror attack and charge it federally as such, President Obama’s U.S. Department of Justice let the local district attorney charge Nolen under state murder statues (and as an assault and battery against survivor Traci Johnson). The whole disgusting affair was quickly forgotten by the rest of the nation, government, and all but those involved and some locals. But make no mistake: This was a jihadist terror attack on American soil.

This attack and its repercussions warrants our full national attention and should be properly memorialized until all related matters are finally resolved, not least for any comfort this can still bring the victim, survivors, and witnesses. Terrorism acknowledgement and media treatment can encourage the nation to comfort those who were there and help them close the emotionally important loop of knowing why loved ones and innocents died, who did it, and for what cause.

Calling terrorism out for what it is portends practical benefits too. Federal acknowledgement of Islamic terrorism opens the throttle on investigations that can identify co-conspirators and foreign connections. Public acknowledgement and remembrance can spur suspicious activity reporting from the general public, which can roll up other cocked and loaded extremists before they also kill.

Also importantly, federalizing the identification of terrorism cases helps homeland security authorities look inward to determine if intelligence failures occurred. Homeland security professionals learn from those what not to repeat and how to fix broken processes, to reduce the chances of future law enforcement intelligence failures.

The Obama administration decided not to call this a terror attack or count it as one soon afterward, even though Nolen, a prison convert to Islam, had filled his Facebook page with hideous ISIS propaganda and openly praised the death cult’s rise to global prominence through constant blood-letting. Nolen had just been suspended after co-workers rejected his Islamist proselytizing and demands for religious accommodations at Vaughan Foods. This gave those already predisposed to downplay Islamic terror attacks the excuse needed to suggest workplace violence and mental illness was somehow at play, instead of the prima facie terror attack it was.

Proof of Terrorism Overflowed at Trial

The 2017 trial, which received only some highly localized Oklahoma TV news coverage, decisively showed this was neither mental illness nor workplace violence. Taped police interviews of Nolen and other evidence showed Nolen was motivated by Qur’anic scripture and the very same well-worn extremist ideology we have seen cited for attacks across the globe, to include the 9/11 attacks. Nolen has proven unrepentant.

On September 29, after hearing the evidence a jury rejected defense arguments that Nolen was insane. Right after the attack, for instance, police asked a very calm and collected Nolen if anyone had told him to behead unbelievers. He responded that the Qur’an gave him the idea. (Qur’an 47:4 states that “When you meet the unbelievers, strike their necks.) Nolen answered: “Uh, no. I read the Qur’an. Like I say, the Qur’an is easy to understand. No one guides me but Allah.”

When asked why he beheaded Hufford, he answered: “I just feel like…I did what I needed to do. What Allah says in the Qur’an to do. Oppressors don’t need to be here. You know the Muslim is somebody who submits their will to Allah…Whatever he wants done, that’s what we do…And you know he wants us to get the oppressors out of this place.”

When asked if he regretted murdering Hufford, Nolen answered: “There wasn’t nothing but a trial for me. I passed it because, like I said, I felt oppressed. I knew for sure that, if I was to die right then, I was going to heaven.” He added: “I feel, you know, you know what I’m saying, if I was to die in five or 10 minutes, I’m going to heaven. That’s all that matters to me.”

Nolen also confirmed that he had screamed “Allahu akbar” as he beheaded Hufford.

Johnson testified that she ran into the next room after hearing screaming and saw Nolan standing over Hufford with a bloody knife. “When I saw the defendant, I was frozen. I couldn’t move. And I saw the knife with the blood on the knife, and he made a mad dash toward me and pushed me up against the wall and held me up with his forearm against the wall and just started splicing my neck. He was just going back and forth like he was just cutting a piece of meat.”

The hero of this tragedy is Vaughan, then COO of Vaughan Foods and an Oklahoma County Sheriff’s Office reserve deputy. When the call came that a knife attack was underway, Vaughan suited up with his weapon, ammo, and first aid on a vest. Vaughan testified that he and another employee entered the building where the attack was underway and saw Nolen on top of Johnson. He testified that he called for Nolen to stop. Nolen jumped up, ran around a corner and charged Vaughan at full speed. Vaughan said he fired three rounds.

Nolen leaned against a wall and fell to the ground. Vaughan then held Nolen at bay until police arrived and took the suspect away.

Deserves National Acknowledgement and Coverage

Although Nolen’s execution warrants national notice, no solid date was readily available. Oklahoma has been caught up in political wrangling with death penalty opponents and thus shut down the state’s supply of lethal injection drugs. Most of the state’s executions are awaiting a resolution over state plans to start using nitrogen gas. Earlier this year, the state announced it was working to develop a new execution protocol making nitrogen hypoxia the preferred method.

When this is all sorted out, politically and legally, Nolen’s turn will come and bring the state’s only possible final resolution to this terrorism episode so we can all properly move on. When that resolution is at hand, I hope somehow the world finds out about it.

How Cuomo's War On Guns Turned Into A War On The Bill Of Rights,"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo hasn’t been shy about making his disdain for the National Rifle Association public. During this past election, Cuomo’s campaign even sent out a mailer shouting in bold letters: “If the NRA goes bankrupt, I will remember them in my thoughts and prayers.”

But when Cuomo decided to use state regulators to threaten financial institutions that do business with gun manufacturers and gun-rights associations, he opened a new front that could have far-reaching consequences on First Amendment-protected speech.

The NRA filed a lawsuit last spring after it became known that Cuomo ordered the state’s Department of Financial Services to tell the banks, insurance companies, and other financial firms it oversees “to review any relationships they may have with the National Rifle Association and other similar organizations. Upon this review, the companies are encouraged to consider whether such ties harm their corporate reputations and jeopardize public safety.”

Despite this direct attack on First Amendment-protected freedom of association, Cuomo won reelection easily, in part because even a rebuke by the liberal American Civil Liberties Union on this issue didn’t get mainstream news outlets to investigate and report the consequences if Cuomo wins in court.

The ACLU, of course, doesn’t mind Cuomo’s attacks on gun rights, as they consider the Second Amendment a lesser right if one at all. The ACLU stepped in with a friend-of-the-court brief in support of the NRA in this case because Cuomo had gone after the First Amendment rights of associations like the NRA.

Last November a judge agreed to let the NRA’s lawsuit proceed. U.S. District Judge Thomas McAvoy of the Northern District of New York wrote: “The allegations of direct and implied threats to insurers and financial institutions because of these entities’ links with the NRA, and the allegations of resulting harm to the NRA’s operations, are sufficient to make out plausible First Amendment freedom-of-speech claims.”

Now, it’s worth noting that this entire line of attack on the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms and the First Amendment’s right to associate with whom we chose and to speak freely with others wouldn’t have even been politically possible for Cuomo if the mainstream media treated this issue with a little curiosity—honesty might be too much to hope for.

It’s also worth pointing out that if Cuomo gets away with this First Amendment infringement, these same media members might be next. It is not hard to imagine a politician deciding that, if gun owners and their associations can be silenced and harmed financially for political ends, then they are free to go after other marginalized groups that are problems for them politically. Politicians, so emboldened, have come after members of the media before.

But it isn’t even necessary to weigh the theoretical consequences of this constitutional overstep by Cuomo, as there are already real victims of Cuomo’s zealotry. Cuomo has long been after gun owners and gun makers, a manufacturing sector that still makes its goods in America. Even today, two-thirds of this industry’s products sold in America are made in America.

This isn’t some manufacturing sector that just assembles products in the USA to avoid tariffs, either. This industry cuts and pounds steel into intricate shapes right here in America. This manufacturing sector directly employs about 150,000 mostly blue-collar Americans who make products for more than 100 million Americans who now own over 300 million guns. In fact, more than 17 million of these people have concealed-carry permits for handguns—and that’s not counting the people who carry concealed in the 14 states that now don’t require permits for people to exercise their constitutional right to bear arms.

Cuomo’s impact on them hasn’t just been theoretical. The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), the trade associate for firearms manufacturers (full disclosure: I’ve done some contract work for the NSSF), estimates that in 2013 some one million gun owners in New York State alone became potential felons thanks to Cuomo and other Democrats, as these people owned semiautomatic rifles or shotguns the state deemed “assault weapons.”

Only a small percentage of the residents of New York registered these firearms by a deadline. Many of these people are now living outside the law. Many local sheriffs have said they won’t enforce this law, but the threat still hangs over them.

Cuomo has shown no interest in sending his state police out to arrest and prosecute these presumably otherwise law-abiding people. Doing that wouldn’t be politically savvy. The state also might lose in court, especially on appeal, as these semiautomatic firearms are certainly in “common use” in America and, as the Supreme Court decided in Heller v. D.C. (2008), firearms in common use are protected by the Second Amendment.

All of this seems okay with Cuomo. He is following today’s liberal-progressive playbook of shunning and maligning the many Americans who own and carry guns, as it is far easier to attack and marginalize a faceless politically incorrect group than to deal with them one by one in court.

The mainstream media has given Cuomo political cover to do this. Their treatment of this issue has even emboldened Cuomo so much that he decided he could use state agencies to try to end the financial relationships of gun companies and civil-liberties groups, such as the NRA. The courts will hopefully stop Cuomo’s attack on First Amendment rights. Either way, many in the mainstream media are now complicit in direct assault on the First Amendment.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/12/18/if-cuomo-can-silence-the-speech-of-gun-owners-whos-next/,2018-12-18
Did Panama Ever Reopen Its Investigation Into The Flight 901 Bombing?,"PANAMA CITY, Panama—Several alert, uniformed sentries stood behind defensive barriers in front of the Ahavat Sion synagogue in a tony neighborhood of extreme high-rise hotels and residential buildings, ubiquitous in this prosperous Central American city. The sentries required identification and a stated purpose for the visit, studied my face, and disappeared inside after warning that no exterior photos were allowed for security reasons.

I showed up seven months after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu provided intelligence information to Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela that he said solved a long-unattributed terror attack on this small country of 4 million that includes 15,000 Jews. The mid-air bombing took down Alas Chiricanas Flight 901 in 1994, killing all 22 commuters and crew aboard, including 12 Jews, and had remained unsolved and uninvestigated for nearly a quarter century.

During an official state visit in Israel with President Varela, the Israeli prime minister said it had been a Hezbollah suicide attack. Varela, who had lost a college roommate in the attack, promised a reopened investigation. If Argentina’s investigations of similar attacks on its Jewish community in the early 1990s was any indication, this one in Panama had the potential to lead straight to senior figures in the upper echelons of Iranian and Hezbollah leaderships.

During a reporting trip to Panama in December, I wanted to find out how this potentially consequential investigation was coming along. The synagogue seemed a logical starting place because inside were not only those in contact with the Varela administration about this but surviving relatives and memorials to the dead. I left Panama two weeks later, however, believing it was more likely than not that no such promised investigation of Iran and Hezbollah was actually happening.

A Sleeping Mystery Kicked Awake

There’s good reason Jews throughout Latin America worship behind layers of barricades and security. Few can forget the high-casualty Hezbollah attacks of 1992 and 1994 on Jewish facilities in distant Argentina. Iran and its mortally anti-Semitic Hezbollah proxy maintain clandestine forces throughout Latin America, including Bolivia, Venezuela, Peru, and Nicaragua.

Panama’s 15,000 Jews live mainly in Colon by the Caribbean coast and in Panama City, economically buoyed by industry associated with the Panama Canal. Flight 901 is a painful, lingering episode in the community’s history.

Notably, the bombing of Flight 901, shortly after takeoff from Colon to Panama City, happened one day after the bombing of the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association (AIMA) building in Buenos Aires, Argentina. That one left 85 Jews dead and hundreds injured and captured almost all shares of global media attention.

The main lead for Flight 901 was the mangled torso of a man the FBI later “possibly identified” as Ali Hawa Jamal and said was suspected of carrying a bomb aboard the plane. The FBI’s “Seeking Information” bulletin went unfilled for 24 years.

While no terrorist group claimed either the Flight 901 or the Argentine bombings, deep and thorough investigations of the Argentina bombings, tormented by political mayhem and the murder of the chief prosecutor, eventually produced book-length indictments in 2006 of a slew of senior Iranian government officials and of Hezbollah figures. In 2017, the former president of Argentina was indicted for a cover-up conspiracy with Iran. Tehran has always denied it all.

Netanyahu blew the dust from that status quo, welcomed or not, with a private November 2017 letter to President Varela outlining Israeli intelligence information, presumably about Ali Hawa Jamal. The letter was sent ahead of a planned state visit by Varela to Israel scheduled for the following May.

After that May 2018 visit, both leaders publicly revealed that Israel’s new information had all but solved the bombing. It was a Hezbollah terror attack just like the Argentina attacks, they both indicated at a joint press briefing in May 2018

“Thank you for that information, which I shared with the families,” the Panamanian president told Netanyahu. “And I will keep following that case, to make sure that justice is done.”

Later in Panama, Varela told local reporters he would ask local and international authorities to reopen the investigation “given intelligence reports that clearly show it was a terrorist attack.” Then, in the seven ensuing months, nothing.

Knocking at Doors that Never Opened in Panama

Prior to my trip, through various interlocutors, I tried to set up interviews with Jewish community leaders to see how the investigation was meeting with community expectations and sentiment about it.

I’d had no response, which is how I ended up with the security guards out front, asking for a sit-down interview with community leaders, a rabbi, perhaps the survivors of victims killed in the attack. Eventually, I was asked to submit a list of written questions, which I know from long experience is usually the death knell for a request.

I submitted some questions anyway, looking for any sign of an investigation. They never followed through and allowed the remaining time they knew I had in-country to elapse while deflecting follow-ups.

One Orthodox Jewish family kindly took me in to their high-rise apartment and treated me to a lovely Chanukah night meal and candle lighting (it was night four). But the family was not interested in being quoted about the investigation without community endorsement. The family did lobby on my behalf, but to no avail.

It soon became abundantly clear: No one in the community wanted to talk about the investigation. From others, however, I was able to glean some informed speculation about where the investigation was and what it meant to the community. But by now, my first spark of doubt had caught: maybe there was no investigation.

Doubts Deepen About Investigation Progress

I went to the country’s biggest mainstream newspaper, La Prensa, and met with Juan Carlos Vargas, political editor in Panama City. One question not quite answered by the Panamanian president’s promise to reopen the investigation: to what end? The bomber evidently died with his victims, so he certainly couldn’t be indicted, tried, or convicted.

Carlos said the idea was that investigative conclusions might lead to judicial proceedings against others. This sounded like Argentina. He confirmed that the government had provided no update on its investigation in the seven months since its reopening was announced. He said his newspaper had reported nothing else. I asked how that could possibly be and if he knew whether the investigation was even happening. He said the newspaper didn’t know.

“The Panamanian government opened the case but has released no new information,” Carlos told me. Had he heard anything through sources that he couldn’t publish but would indicate progress? No, he said.

I asked why he thought people from the Jewish community didn’t seem willing to meet with me to discuss the situation. One reason, he said, might be that Jewish community members “didn’t want to relive that. Most have little interest in knowing more. It brings a lot of painful memories.” “They don’t want to be victimized all over again.”

I wondered aloud that, if that was the sentiment, perhaps the Jewish community could have pressured the government into killing the investigation. The journalist told me the community was wealthy and highly influential but that, ultimately, the newspaper didn’t know what was happening.

The Panamanian Government Response

I worked at length with the Panamanian embassy in Washington D.C. for several months ahead of my trip to Panama, mostly for unrelated national security stories. I’d been asking my point of contact in Washington, who was working on my requests with senior security and government officials in Panama, for sit-down interviews with government officials. After a couple of months, though, I got the fatal request to submit a list of questions. I did anyway, including the Flight 901 issue.

I was told if the president didn’t want to actually push an Iran-Hezbollah investigation, all he had to do was wait it out and he’d be off the hook.

I received a catch-all response by email declining to discuss national security-related matters, which could be understandable, given that public disclosure could damage the proceedings. But the government response also did nothing to reassure my growing sense that maybe an investigation into Flight 901 wasn’t really happening.

“With regards to ongoing investigations,” my embassy contact wrote in an email, “our authorities have no comment. We understand this may not be the detailed response you expected, however it is all the information we can provide at this point.”

While in Panama, I interviewed three members of the Panamanian Assembly, which is akin to the U.S. Congress. One was Juan Carlos Arrango. His Panamanian Popular Party was a member of President Varelo’s ruling coalition. Like the La Prensa political editor, Arrango is in a unique position to catch information about the investigation. But he too professed to knowing absolutely nothing about the investigation beyond initial reports that there would be one.

Cesar Argueta, of the opposition party Democratic Revolutionary Party, similarly had heard nothing in government circles about the investigation. He could only offer that: “If the Israeli government is asking to reopen the case, in particular, I would have to say that is because they have information that Panama doesn’t have. Because they have information they have been able to collect, that allows them to find the culprits of that act.”

While at the assembly, a parliamentary insider I spoke to reminded me that President Varela was a lame-duck president. He is constitutionally unable to run again in a new national election scheduled for May of this year. I was told if the president didn’t want to actually push an Iran-Hezbollah investigation, all he had to do was wait it out and he’d be off the hook.

The Israeli Non-Response

The Israeli government is never known to miss an opportunity to criticize Hezbollah and discuss its nefarious networks in Latin America and anywhere else in the world. Except, evidently, in the case of Panama.

After returning from Panama doubting Flight 901 will be investigated, I reached out to the Israeli government through its public affairs section at the embassy in Washington. For sure, I thought, the Israelis would be able to confirm the promised investigation actually went forward.

After submitting a detailed email about what I wanted, I was assigned to spokesman Elad Strohmayer. In return emails before and during the holidays, he seemed amenable to setting up interviews to impart information about Flight 901 and Hezbollah in Latin America contemporarily and more generally.

But nothing ever came of it after repeated voice messages and email from me through to now. I gave up, left to presume there was something so clearly radioactive about this investigation and terror attack that no one would talk out loud about it—not even the normally loquacious Israelis who re-started it all.

An Unsettled Mystery Forever?

Either I simply had terrible reportorial luck over a period of three months, not finding the right people at the right time with questions about sensitive investigations. Or there simply is no investigation into Flight 901, and no one wants to admit it.

Experience, gut, and result have me leaning toward the latter. My running theory is that no one in Panama wants to repeat Argentina’s tumult over its investigations. Taking on Iranian ruling mullahs with indictments has proven painfully consequential in Argentina. Perhaps Netanyahu inadvertently put the Panamanians on the spot where they never really wanted to be.

The presence of Iran and Hezbollah in this region of the world did not end 25 years ago, particularly in Panama.

I stand ready for my theory to be proven wrong and to write about any new contrarian information. The presence of Iran and Hezbollah in this region of the world did not end 25 years ago, particularly in Panama. That matters in a national security, context because Panama is a major strategic American ally, with a stake in the canal’s uninterrupted operation.

From a current New York court case about which I have written extensively, we learn that Hezbollah sent a U.S.-based operative to Panama for months of intelligence collection as recently as 2012. In court papers, it emerged that Samer El Debek of Dearborn, Michigan was a Hezbollah 910 operative, the notorious clandestine terrorists who move around the world conducting assassinations and bombings like in Thailand. The court records say Hezbollah sent El Debek to Panama for at least a month in 2011 and again in 2012, where he collected target information on the Panama Canal, American embassy, Israeli consulate, and Jewish community.

El Debek transferred all of this intelligence to Hezbollah afterward. The group would still have all of it. Beyond any immediate threat to Panama targets, while in Israel last year President Varela voiced the most persuasive reason for a strong, decisive and conclusive investigation into Flight 901.

“I believe in public life we should always be on the right side, to make sure that nothing like this happens again, in my country or anywhere else in the world. Fighting terrorism shouldn’t have boundaries. Fighting terrorism should unite all human beings, to stop evil that all terrorism represents and to fight for the right to all human beings to live in this world in peace.”

Here’s to hoping he follows through before he leaves office.

Why Are Democrats Smearing Venezuela’s Leftist Interim President?,"Few international crises have more moral clarity and left American policymakers with easier choices than the situation in Venezuela. On one hand, we can support Nicolas Maduro, an anti-American authoritarian despot whose term ended on January 10 after he usurped his country’s constitution in a fraudulent presidential election that was deemed as illegitimate by over 40 nations, including most of Latin America.

Alternatively, we can back Maduro’s democratically elected opponent, Juan Guaido, a charismatic 35-year-old progressive political activist and leader of Venezuela’s National Assembly who, pursuant to Venezuela’s constitution, is the country’s interim president. Most regional governments recognize the young engineer as the country’s true leader. Guaido is also a co-founder of the center-left Voluntad Popular (Popular Will) party, which helped elect Venezuela’s first-ever openly gay members of the national legislature and supports fully restoring democracy in the South American nation.

To recap, Guaido is:

Young? Check.

Brown? Check.

Telegenic? Check.

Pro-LGBT? Check.

Democratic? Check.

Pro-Social Justice? Check.

In fact, Guaido is everything the left claims to be and support. Had he been born in the United States, he’d be a high-profile national leader and on the VP shortlist of any Democratic presidential nominee. Given Guaido’s political bona fides and Maduro’s unpopularity, you’d figure that American progressives, who like to stress they’re more democratic than socialist, would be rushing to embrace him—but they’re not.

Smear Campaign Against Guaido

Instead, within hours of the State Department announcing it would join most of the region’s governments in recognizing Guaido as Venezuela’s provisional president, a group of progressive members of Congress launched what appeared to be a coordinated effort to cast doubts on the legitimacy of the young leader.

The first strike came from the vice chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Rep. Ro Khanna of California who had previously co-signed a letter reprimanding the Treasury Department for specifically targeting Nicolas Maduro with financial sanctions. In response to a tweet from a journalist with close ties to Russian state media, Khanna warned the U.S. against “pushing for regime change” in Venezuela.

It’s strange enough that for American member of Congress to quote-tweet a Kremlin-connected reporter and come out strongly opposed to financial sanctions on a foreign tyrant. Later on Wednesday evening, the sophomore congressman took his Venezuela advocacy a step further by publicly rebuking a fellow Democrat. In a statement, Dick Durbin, the senior senator from Illinois, praised the Trump administration and other regional leaders for “appropriately [recognizing] National Assembly President Juan Guaido as the constitutionally appropriate leader of Venezuela.”

Khanna pounced on Durbin’s letter by arguing that rather than “anointing” a head of state, the U.S. should push for a negotiated settlement with the Vatican and the pro-Maduro governments of Mexico and Uruguay that would only prolong the regime in Caracas. Media darling (and newly-minted representative) Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who has been conspicuously silent on Venezuela, shared Khanna’s tweet to her followers, which could be interpreted as an endorsement of his position.

The next day, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii (also a 2020 presidential candidate) took to Twitter to comment on the situation in Caracas. In a series of tweets, Gabbard said “the US needs to stay out of Venezuela” and “stop trying to choose” its leaders.

Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont made a similar point . In a tweet thread that began as critical of Maduro before it built up to an attack on Guaido’s ascension, the democratic socialist warned that the United States should “not be in the business of regime change or supporting coups” in Latin America.

Is Trump really an anti-interventionist? From ""bombing the hell"" out of civilians, to ramping-up brutal sanctions, to becoming Arms Salesman-In-Chief––our new @EmpireFiles series shows how he's been a gift to the war machine. https://t.co/3SmyiU9YEt — Abby Martin (@AbbyMartin) January 11, 2019

Undoubtedly, though, the harshest attacks on the interim South American president came from Congresswoman Ilhan Omar (who shared the embedded tweet above). In addition to retweeting pro-Maduro propaganda from reporters tied to Venezuelan and Russian state media shops, the freshman representative from Minnesota echoed Khanna’s call for a negotiation with Mexico and Uruguay while accusing the United States of installing a right-wing puppet on behalf of corporate interests. “Trump’s efforts to install a far right opposition will only incite violence and further destabilize the region,” she added.

The Progressives’ Attacks Don’t Hold Up To Scrutiny

To be clear, most of what Khanna, Gabbard, Omar, Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders tweeted is false and some of it would be laughable if it weren’t for the damage their attacks could cause Guaido and the Venezuelan opposition.

As Helena Poleo, a Venezuelan-American Democratic activist in Miami, explained:

“It’s ridiculous and deeply ignorant to call Guaido a member of the ‘far right’ as some have alleged. He is a leader in Voluntad Popular, which is actually a center-left party and member of the Socialist International alliance. These comments are extremely harmful to the Venezuelan cause, and makes it very difficult to be a Venezuelan Democrat.”

Indeed, it’s difficult to imagine anywhere on the planet—outside of maybe Havana and Pyongyang—where Guaido would fall on the right side of a political spectrum, especially on the far end of one. His party’s platform calls for government-guaranteed housing, health care, and education for all citizens.

He was also elected as a Venezuelan National Assembly official in 2010, long before Trump was president. Moreover, the United States is not involved in a coup because none is taking place. We are simply working with our allies in Argentina, the Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Paraguay, and Peru, among others, and acknowledging the fact that Guaido is Venezuela’s interim president in accordance with his country’s constitution.

“It’s a bold, and clearly organized move,” said Christopher Sabatini, a professor at the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University. “But something needed to be done to break the deadlock and prevent an illegitimately elected president from continuing to kick the can down the road and avoid international accountability for holding his country hostage.”

The progressives’ position is also riddled with self-contradictions. If their primary concern is undue intervention from Washington, it makes no sense for them to advocate the State Department pressuring opposition leaders to pursue a negotiation mediated by two pro-Maduro governments that are hostile to the interests and views of the vast majority of Venezuelans and the region.

Useful Idiots Or Just Leftist Idiocy?

Ultimately, the Venezuelan people and policymakers in Washington face a binary choice. Not backing Guaido means supporting Maduro, who has made it clear he has no interest in leaving office or holding free elections. That said, it’s unclear why these progressive Democrats are siding with one of the worst dictators in the world.

Their pro-Maduro advocacy is also no coincidence. There’s simply no chance that a group of members of Congress—from the same caucus, no less—independently decided to use nearly identical talking points to attack a left-leaning foreign politician without some kind of outside direction or encouragement. In fact, congressional offices routinely rely on third parties—such as lobbyists, consultants, and interests groups—for guidance on matters beyond their expertise. So, the question is: who’s advising them and their staffs?

A good place to start would be to examine who has a vested interest in maintaining the status quo in Venezuela and the resources to lobby and influence members of Congress. At least one answer to this question points to Moscow, which has a record of attempting to influence American politics; military and geopolitical interests in keeping the Venezuelan regime in power; and has even dispatched mercenaries to guard Maduro.

It would not be the first time that some of these progressive Democrats peddle media narratives that advance Vladimir Putin’s interests, beyond their sharing of tweets by Russia-connected reporters. In 2017, Gabbard famously met with the Moscow-backed Assad regime in Syria . Last year, the Hawaii Free Press reported the congresswoman hired a consultant that lobbies for the Russian government and is allegedly at the center of its shadowy lobbying efforts in Washington. In addition, according to a former Defense Department official , Russia was the likely source of Khanna’s attacks on anti-Putin Ukrainian forces in a series of interviews and a tweet he later deleted .

Of course, another explanation for the progressives’ pro-Maduro PR push is that, as far left members of Congress, they have sympathy for the socialist Bolivarian Revolution. As many have pointed out before , contrary to what politicians and pundits say, democratic socialists like Ocasio-Cortez and Omar have more in common ideologically with Latin American leftists than the Nordic social democrats the media like to depict them as.

Regardless of whether it’s influence from foreign actors or just socialist camaraderie, Americans deserve to know why four members of Congress have decided to stand with a cruel tyrant over U.S. interests. Not only are they undermining U.S. foreign policy and hurting the cause of Venezuelan democracy, their advocacy bolsters Putin’s regional objectives—all at the expense of a young, democratically-elected leader who, if he were an American, would be caucusing alongside them.

Here’s What We Know About The Alleged Attack On Actor Jussie Smollett,"Ever since Jussie Smollett, the star of “Empire” on Fox, reported that he was beaten by two masked men yelling racist and homophobic slurs early Tuesday morning, Chicago police have been slow to find corroborating evidence. TMZ and other outlets have corrected several of their initial reports of the alleged incident. Here is what we currently know.

1. Smollett Requested Police Turn Off Their Body Cameras; Was Wearing Noose When They Arrived

According to Chicago reporter Rob Elgas, when police arrived to take a report, Smollett asked that the officers turn off their body cameras. A Chicago Police Department spokesperson said this is not uncommon and that when entering a private residence, officers are supposed to inform citizens they are wearing cameras.

Chicago PD also said when they arrived at the apartment, Smollett was still wearing the noose attackers put around his neck, and others reported he wore it throughout their entire 40-minute interview.

CPD also says: when Smollett contacted police at 2:42AM, he was still wearing the rope around his neck. The alleged encounter occurred at 2AM. Police have the rope and it will be analyzed. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) January 29, 2019

Using building security footage, Police confirmed that Smollett was, “wearing a rope like a neck tie,” when he walked into the lobby of his building.

2. Smollett Did Not Turn Over His Phone To Police

Several media outlets reported that Smollett refused to turn over his phone and phone records to police. He said he was on the phone with his manager when the attack happened, and the manager was the one who called 911 dispatch. However, TMZ is reporting a discrepancy with the description that he “refused.”

The sources say cops “informally asked” Jussie if he would surrender his phone … to verify he was talking to his manager on his cell when he was attacked. We’re told he felt “uncomfortable” doing that and declined, but he was never asked about phone records. A Chicago police official had said Jussie refused to turn over both the phone and records. We’re told Smollett has already said he will provide the records, and is in the process of gathering them.

In a statement given to ESSENCE Magazine Friday morning, Smollett said he is frustrated by inaccurate reports and that he is cooperating with police.

“I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level,” he said. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.”

Elgas also noted that police do not have a warrant to search his phone records.

Chicago police also say Jussie Smollett is NOT the target or focus of any criminal investigation, he is the victim. Police have no interest or probable cause to obtain a warrant to search his phone records. — Rob Elgas (@RobElgasABC7) January 31, 2019

3. No Video Evidence of the Attack, Police Release Person of Interest Images

Over a dozen police officers have been sifting through footage to piece together Smollett’s report. After searching for surveillance footage for over 24 hours and broadening their search, police finally located a camera with “potential persons of interest” around the time of the attack but the images are too dark to see any faces. They also found stretches of footage of Smollett’s walk from the Subway sandwich shop he was at to his apartment.

4. Smollett Never Said His Attackers Were White

Multiple media outlets ran TMZ’s report that the attackers were, “both white and wearing ski masks.”

As Robby Soave at Reason pointed out, a Chicago PD spokesperson denied that Smollett reported the attacker’s race. “According to the victim, the offenders’ faces were concealed,” a police spokesperson told Reason.

5. Attackers Allegedly Yelled ‘This is MAGA Country’

In the first police reported taken on Tuesday about 40 minutes after the attack, there is no mention of “MAGA.” But a police spokesperson has now told multiple outlets that when detectives followed up with Smollett later on Tuesday, he recalled the offenders making those comments, and detectives completed a supplemental report.

6. Police Are Investigating A Letter Sent To Smollett Last Week

Smollett received a threatening letter on the set of Empire more than a week before the attack. Chicago PD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CNN the letter contained a white powder but it was determined to be aspirin.

ThatGrapeJuice.Net has reported to have obtained a picture of the letter (below) which includes a homophobic slur and what appears to be “MAGA” on the top right corner. Apparently, after receiving the letter, Fox wanted to get around the clock security guards for Smollett but he turned it down.

Leftists To WI Judge: You Can't Be A Good Judge If You're A Christian,"With six weeks left until election day in Wisconsin’s Supreme Court race, several far-left organizations are using media outlets to amplify a smear campaign against a judge based on his Christianity. Brian Hagedorn, a current Wisconsin Court of Appeals judge and former Scott Walker legal counsel, is being publicly trashed for being on the board of a small Christian school, and for blog posts when he was in law school discussing court cases about abortion and gay sex.

In considering a run for the state Supreme Court, the father of five children says, “I expected to be attacked here because that’s what’s happening all across the country–you know, ‘Are you now or have you ever been associated with the Knights of Columbus?'” he said, chuckling. “Interrogating people [nominated for office] if they went to a Bible study or the Knights of Columbus, that’s where we are as a country.”

The media characterization of his writing is often misleading. For example, a ThinkProgress hit piece claims that, in a blog post paraphrasing former Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia’s dissent on a case about Texas sodomy laws, Hagedorn “compared homosexuality to bestiality.” In fact, his post simply notes the U.S. Constitution has nothing to say about any supposed rights to sex with anyone or anything, then essentially paraphrases Scalia’s dissent, which two other justices joined.

That dissent said striking a law against sodomy on the grounds that states are constitutionally forbidden from banning any sexual activity citizens consider “immoral and unacceptable” also eliminates the legal basis for “criminal laws against fornication, bigamy, adultery, adult incest, bestiality, and obscenity.” Scalia instead invited LGBT activists to persuade their fellow citizens that sodomy bans were wrong and change the laws, rather than using courts to eliminate the legal basis on which states criminalize socially disapproved sexual behaviors.

While a law student in 2005, Hagedorn simply wrote he agreed with this legal analysis. It doesn’t compare bestiality and homosexuality in anything except the basis for former laws against them. That both were illegal on this basis until relatively recently is simply a fact. Yet like ThinkProgress, several Wisconsin outlets quoted context-free snippets of Hagedorn’s post in a rush to paint him as a bigot.

“The news reports have been entirely misleading on that,” Hagedorn said in a phone interview. “They often can’t track the legal arguments… The argument I was making was nothing other than what three Supreme Court justices made in that very case. The Lawrence v. Texas decision’s logic was not strong. I am not myself interested in relitigating all those issues today, but that argument that was made was just tracking that Supreme Court case.”

The attacks on Hagedorn also target a small Christian school that he and his wife helped found. Associated Press, Wisconsin State Journal, and Wisconsin Public Radio headlines falsely said the school “bans LGBT teachers, students,” “bar[s] gays” and “bans homosexuals.” No, the school’s conduct code forbids “students, parents and teachers from ‘participating in immoral sexual activity (defined as any form of touching or nudity for the purpose of evoking sexual arousal apart from the context of marriage between one man and one woman).'”

That’s only a gay ban if you offensively assume gay people can’t resist having sex. Remember, students are minors whom many think shouldn’t engage in sex at all regardless of what kind. Under this policy gay students could be welcomed. Therefore, it’s not a “gay ban.”

Further, if it is a gay ban then it’s also a cohabiting and makeout ban, but people who cohabit and make out aren’t (yet) identity groups that can be weaponized to amass political power, so no news story makes that connection. So do Christians also hate cohabitors and people who hook up and make out and twerk, or does Christianity hold extremely high standards for sexual behavior that are not at all limited to homosexuality? We can’t consider the latter, apparently, because that contradicts the politically useful narrative that people of faith bear some particular ill will towards homosexuals.

In a press release and to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, however, the activist group One Wisconsin Now pushed that divisive and religiously bigoted narrative, calling the 40-student school “an organization that actively discriminates against the LGBTQ community” because its conduct codes say Christians must reserve sex for natural marriage. This is a core Christian teaching and has been for 2,000 years. If any organization that holds this view “actively discriminates against the LGBTQ community,” then all orthodox Christian, Islamic, and Jewish organizations, as well as many Bhuddist and Hindu organizations, are centers of bigotry. Good luck convincing the majority of the world’s cultures and religions that they are evil bigots for upholding thousands of years of cross-cultural and cross-religious teachings.

The argument against Hagedorn seems to be that no faithful religious believer can also be a good public official, in line with a crop of similar attacks on federal nominees at the federal level from prominent Democrats including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Sen. Cory Booker, Sen. Kamala Harris, Sen. Mazie Hirono, and Sen. Bernie Sanders. How convenient for the minority of secularists to define their tribe as the only one eligible for rule. And whatever happened to tolerance and pluralism, and not discriminating against people based on their identity?

“My job as a judge is to say what the law is and not what it should be,” Hagedorn said. “This is an effort to attack me for my faith and take this [campaign] in directions that are irrelevant to the job that I’m doing of applying the law faithfully.”

Not only are these kinds of attacks against people of faith the real bigotry at play, they are massively ignorant, in bad faith, and unconstitutional: “no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States,” says the U.S. Constitution’s article six.

Hagedorn says his conservative judicial philosophy restrains him from doing anything other than applying the laws equally and impartially, regardless of his personal religious or political beliefs. In fact, he said, “Any judge who does not regularly issue a decision he does not agree with is not a good judge. My job is not to decide whether I like the law or policy or not. We need to stop politicizing our courts and stop incorporating one’s own views into judicial decisionmaking.”

The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel even contacted the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights to ask about the school, and raised the prospect of “lawsuits alleging discrimination against the school’s officials or Hagedorn.” Nice little school you made for your kids there. Be a shame if the federal government investigated it or somebody filed a discrimination lawsuit. Thankfully, Hagedorn says, private religious schools have the well-established legal right to hire and fire based on their religious beliefs.

“All I can do is treat people with dignity and respect and gentleness,” Hagedorn said, when asked how these attacks are affecting him personally. “I’ve always tried to do that. I think there’s likely to be people who do continue to be excluded for some period of time [for their religion]. If I’m one of them, so be it. But I’m going to try to be faithful to the calling I have… Maybe I can be one small stone in the river that says this is not okay. I am going to be a judge who applies the law fairly to everybody regardless of my Christian faith. We need to move past this as a culture and a country.”

These smears against Hagedorn and others like him nominated or running for public office hang a “No Christians need apply” sign on not only public offices but entire professions, such as law, health, and education. In all of these domains, and more, Christians are increasingly told to check their convictions at the door.

This kind of political pressure also implies that, in an America rapidly embedding LGBT legal and cultural preferences, religious integrity is increasingly at odds with the political regime. Christians — and Jews and Buddhists and other faithful believers — have lived in those kinds of hostile societies before.

“The great thing about being a Christian is that my hope is not in this life,” Hagedorn said. “All I can do is be faithful to what I’ve been called to and let the chips fall where they may.”",https://thefederalist.com/2019/02/18/leftists-wi-supreme-court-candidate-cant-good-judge-youre-christian/,2019-02-18
Head Of Chicago Police Shames Jussie Smollett For ‘Phony Attack’,"Actor Jussie Smollett was charged Wednesday for filing a false police report. On Thursday, Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson held an emotional press conference, saying he was offended and angered by Smollett’s hoax.

Johnson shamed Smollett for exploiting racism, homophobia, and manipulating the painful symbol of a noose to further his career and public profile. Police say it is now clear that Smollett concocted the false story because he was dissatisfied with his salary.

“How can an individual who has been embraced by the city of Chicago, turn around and slap everyone in this city in the face by making these false claims?” Johnson said. “Bogus police reports cause real harm. They do real harm to every legitimate victim who is in need of support by police and investigators.”

“The accusations behind this phony attack received national attention for weeks — celebrities, news commentators, and even presidential candidates weighed in on something choreographed by an actor,” police said of #JussieSmollett, who claimed he was attacked by Trump supporters pic.twitter.com/ZklRheaslc — POLITICO (@politico) February 21, 2019

A week before the alleged attack, Smollett reported receiving a threatening letter with a white powder at the Fox production studios in Chicago. When that stunt failed to receive attention, Smollett orchestrated the attack by paying two brothers he knew $3,500 to assault him while getting food around 2 a.m.

In the weeks following the alleged incident, Chicago police spent hours poring over security footage and devoting resources that could have been put toward real victims––like the 1-year-old baby who was shot twice in the head last week on Chicago’s South Side.

“I just wish that the families of gun violence in this city got this much attention, because that’s who really deserves the amount of attention that we’re giving to this particular incident,” Johnson said.

Johnson said he is also concerned that real hate crimes will now be met publicly with skepticism:

“I’m also concerned about what this means moving forward for hate crimes. Now of course, the Chicago Police Department all reports of these types of incidents with the same amount of vigor that we did with this one. But my concern is that now hate crimes will publicly be met with a level of skepticism that previously didn’t happen.”

He also called out the circus of media figures who rushed to make Smollett’s report a national story:

“This publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn’t earn and certainly didn’t deserve. To make things worse, the accusations within this phony attack received national attention for weeks. Celebrities, news commentators, and even presidential candidates weighed in on something that was choreographed by an actor.”

The Epidemic Of Anti-Jewish Hate Crimes In Brooklyn Is No Hoax,"As much of the country was transfixed by a hoaxed hate crime in Chicago over the past month, a very real wave of hate crimes in Brooklyn has been taking place. In New York City overall there have been 36 hate crimes against Jews so far this year, according to The New York Times, compared to only 21 last year. In the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn alone, ultra-orthodox Jews have been violently attacked at least 15 times since October of last year.

In most of these cases there is no apparent motive beyond anti-Semitism. No robbery occurs, and often the attackers — generally black men — and their victims are complete strangers. State and local government, as well as the New York City Police Department, have stepped up measures to protect the community, but the incidents have continued apace.

The spate of anti-Semitic attacks raises some significant questions. First and foremost, why is this happening and how can it be stopped? But also, why have the news media and the nation’s politicians been so quiet about an epidemic of hate crime in our country’s largest city? Why isn’t this a big story?

To get at an answer to the first question, we have to peer back through some troubling Brooklyn history. In 1991, the Crown Heights riots exploded in the Brooklyn neighborhood shared mainly by black and ultra-orthodox New Yorkers. Tensions between the two groups had existed for years. Then, a Jewish driver killed a black child. The crash was clearly shown to be an accident, not intentional or negligent, but deadly violence was the result nonetheless. In the years since, tensions have calmed, but never truly disappeared.

The roots of the disputes are murky. The ultra-orthodox are a strange set of neighbors in New York City. It is an insular community, in which a strict form of Jewish law, including dress codes and famously hats, is enforced. Anyone who attempts to leave the community, or live outside of its silo, is cut off from friends and family.

This is not the kind of attitude one typically looks for in neighbors. Its one thing for the Amish to promulgate this kind of lifestyle in rural Pennsylvania, but the ultra-orthodox are smack in the middle of the most populous borough of New York City. Existing in such an exclusive way in that environment is sure to cause tension, but just as surely is not grounds to be physically attacked.

For its part, the black community in New York City has struggled with accusations of anti-Semitism dating back at least to the riots. Louis Farrakhan’s Nation of Islam has a foothold in the community, and with that comes some pretty awful messages about Jews. Even non-adherents to the Nation of Islam in the black community have a complicated relationship to Farrakhan and his message.

Recently Women’s March leader Tamika Mallory put this in some perspective when she refused to denounce Farrakhan’s anti-Semitism, citing the good works he has done in black communities. To a lot of Jews, this is like saying you won’t denounce the Klan’s racism because they do a Christmas toy drive. Jewish organizations have attempted to do outreach into the black community, but frankly, the black community has its own work to do, especially in terms of condemning anti-Semites like Farrakhan.

The question of why this onslaught of anti Jewish violence is happening so quietly is not as important as stopping the violence, but it’s still important. Any fair-minded observer would agree that if 15 black people had been victims of racially motivated beatings in relatively white Bensonhurst since October, it would be a big national story. In fact, just one such alleged incident in Chicago got more coverage on its own than the attacks in Brooklyn have.

To some degree this is explained by the fact that the ultra-orthodox keep their own counsel, and do not engage in a lot of public relations outreach. But it’s more than that. It is very clear that news outlets are much more comfortable not only reporting, but also extrapolating on white violence against blacks than they are black violence against Jews.

Some of this reticence may be understandable. It can be reasonable for journalists to consider race in how they cover a story. Given the unfair stereotypes about black men regarding crime and violence, it makes sense to try to avoid feeding that stereotype. But the answer cannot simply be to bury the story because it is uncomfortable. Rather, the facts and context can be reported and explored in a nuanced manner that makes clear no broad generalizations about anyone are being asserted.

Likewise, politicians both locally and nationally need to speak up about this violence against Jews. In the wake of the alleged Smollett attacks, the tweets poured like wine from Democratic presidential candidates, yet none seem very interested in these repeated attacks on Jews in Brooklyn. That should change.

Shining a spotlight on white racists, such as the abhorrent participants in Charlottesville, is easy. It comports with a comfortable narrative about how vestiges of white supremacy still exist and must be confronted. Talking about black men committing violent hate crimes against Jews is far more complicated and difficult, yet it has to happen.

If these attacks continue, and the press continues to shield the city and country from it, people are going to die, just as they did in 1991. Now is the time when we need strong leadership from local officials and a news media willing to be upfront about what is going on. If that doesn’t happen, there is every reason to believe Brooklyn’s ultra-orthodox Jewish and black communities could be headed back into the bad old days.

Cruz To Offer Resolution Explicitly Condemning Anti-Semitism,"As soon as recess is over on March 25, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is expected to file a congressional resolution exclusively condemning anti-Semitism. It aims to upstage the Democrat-controlled House’s recent anti-hate resolution, which passed last week with a final vote of 403-27.

In response to anti-Semitic comments made by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), the House initially considered a resolution condemning only anti-Semitism. However, after several Democrats expressed consternation at the exclusion of other forms of bigotry, the resolution’s language was expanded to condemn various others.

The Federalist has obtained the final, expanded language of Cruz’s resolution condemning solely anti-Semitism. Congressional sources have confirmed that the received text is the final version and that it is currently being widely circulated for cosponsors.

At just under 300 words, the text directly addresses the anti-Semitism that Democratic leadership in the House could not singularly and explicitly condemn, likely due to a craven fear of upsetting their increasingly anti-Semitic progressive wing.

The House’s failure to exclusively condemn anti-Semitism through the passage of a less specific resolution is merely one data point in the contemporary rise of anti-Jewish hate: the recent uptick in hate crimes against Jews, particularly in areas such as Brooklyn, which saw a 22 percent increase in hate crimes in 2018 alone; the proliferation of boycott, divest, sanction (BDS) groups on college campuses, which use the cloak of anti-Israel rhetoric to mask virulent anti-Semitism; and now, House leadership, sitting idly by as Democrat legislators spew anti-Semitic tropes to little rebuke. If passed, Cruz’s resolution would correct what was not done properly the first time—a full-throated condemnation of anti-Semitism.

Cruz’s resolution does not name individual legislators, like Omar or Rep. Rashida Tlaib (two congresswomen accused of peddling anti-Semitic rhetoric), but addresses anti-Semitic behavior on the whole, a generalized format that may ultimately be more effective.

The Senate is arguably the greatest deliberative body in the world. To name two freshman House representatives who have been in office for 10 weeks in a Senate resolution might cheapen the resolution’s overall message—that anti-Semitism is not just a matter of individual congressional figures behaving maliciously, but instead is a contemporary problem that demands confrontation and contains a dark history stretching back thousands of years. Cruz’s resolution is one attempt to engage in a very much-needed reckoning.

Cruz’s resolution acknowledges the historical distinctiveness of anti-Semitism in a way that House Democrats were unable and unwilling to do. The resolution traces the fraught and vile history of anti-Semitism as “a unique form of prejudice stretching back more than 2,000 years that aims at the physical destruction of the Jewish people, and has included the murder of approximately 6,000,000 Jews by Nazi Germany.”

The resolution also explicitly mentions the dual-loyalty trope that has characterized anti-Semitic attacks for centuries, “including the fabrication and circulation of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion by the Secret Police of Russia.” In the age of Omar’s dual-loyalty attacks against members of Congress who express support for Israel, this acknowledgement seems particularly poignant.

Cruz’s resolution is also distinct in that it outlines the various attacks “on the livelihood of Jews” that have been the substance of both past and present anti-Semitism. From the prohibition of Jewish land ownership in the Middle Ages to the confiscation and destruction of Jewish businesses in Nazi Germany, a frequent mechanism of attack for anti-Semites has been to economically isolate Jews.

What makes Cruz’s resolution particularly powerful is that the left’s BDS movement is included amongst the listed tactics employed to economically isolate Jews. Defining BDS in this manner is an unabashed condemnation of an anti-Semitic movement that has been marketed by progressives as merely “anti-Israel.”

Omar and Tlaib have expressed support for BDS, which claims boycotting not just Israeli products but Israeli people equates to seizing some moral high ground. The BDS movement has become a convenient cover for contemporary anti-Semitism, infecting college campuses and now the halls of Congress.

In addition to identifying the various attacks waged on Jewish livelihoods, the resolution outlines other forms of anti-Semitic practices that have existed in the United States over the past 50 years, including the exclusion of Jews from certain neighborhoods, private clubs, medical practices, and other businesses, and restrictions on the number of Jews admitted to elite universities and institutions. Furthermore, the resolution alludes to the frequent anti-Semitic accusation of Jews “purchasing political power with money,” another trope Omar invoked in her disturbed Twitter tirades.

For Jewish lawmakers in Congress whose childhoods and parents’ childhoods were colored by such anti-Semitism, whose grandparents may have fled or suffered persecution in Europe or elsewhere, and who may experience anti-Semitic attacks today, this resolution signifies that such treatment will meet disapproval in at least some halls of Congress.

In acknowledging that Jews are also subjected to the majority of religious hate crimes in this country, despite comprising only 2 percent of the population, the resolution identifies the unique importance of having a document that explicitly and singularly condemns such hatred. It is hard to imagine Senate Democrats taking issue with such a resolution. If they do, it will be because they fear pushback from the anti-Semitic progressive wing of the party more than they desire to condemn anti-Semitism—a failure representing the height of moral cowardice.

Elderly Man Assaulted By Pro-Choicer While Praying For End To Abortion,"A series of escalating attacks led to an elderly pro-life man being repeatedly viciously kicked on the sidewalk by a bicyclist in San Francisco, California, on March 19. Ron, who is a longtime campaign leader with the organization 40 Days For Life, was outside of a Planned Parenthood clinic when he was attacked. Previously, the attacker cut the group’s signature banner with a pair of scissors and knocked Ron and another volunteer to the ground.

This time, Ron attempted to stop the same attacker from stealing the sign by holding onto it and sticking the sign pole through the spokes of the man’s bike. He responded by pushing Ron to the ground with his bike, saying, “Old man, stay on the ground. Stay on the ground old man, unless you want to get hurt.” He immediately then started kicking Ron, and this is where the video ends so Ron’s companion could call 911.

Matt Britton, general counsel for 40 Days for Life, is representing Ron. The video of this attack is distressing, and going through the attack was even more so for Ron himself, who is 85 years old.

The effects of a sudden, violent attack like this can be lasting for people, something that Britton is experienced with from his past as a district attorney: “It takes a while for folks to even recover psychologically and emotionally. Violence happens very quickly. This was a much younger man, and just to go through that … I think just the whole trauma of it. I think trauma’s a really good word to describe this more than injury.”

40 Days for Life’s History in San Francisco

For the last 12 years, 40 Days for Life has held prayer vigils outside of abortion clinics like Planned Parenthood, with a peaceful history. This year’s vigil runs from March 6 to April 14 , with the attack happening in front of the Planned Parenthood on Valencia Street in San Francisco. It’s one of the 90 or so campaigns happening nationwide.

40 Days for Life and their prayers on the sidewalks feature in the upcoming movie “Unplanned” about Abby Johnson, the former Planned Parenthood director turned pro-life advocate and was pivotal in her leaving the abortion giant. Their methods of engagement with those going in and out of clinics are to respectfully talk to clinic workers and mothers and to pray for them.

Shawn Carney, the president and CEO of 40 Days for Life , issued a statement about the altercation: “40 Days for Life vigils have a 12-year track record of being peaceful. This attack on an 85-year old man–who has been leading the San Francisco campaign for years—by a young aggressor shows that the idea that San Francisco is tolerant is a joke. We believe every person should be treated with kindness, love and respect, even those with whom we may disagree. That said, over the past few months, we have seen an increase in violence from abortion supporters in an effort to instill fear and deter our law-abiding volunteers.”

Response by the Police Department

Ron’s attacker has not been identified yet. Life Legal Defense Fund , a California-based pro-life legal firm, is working with 40 Days for Life to pass out fliers in the neighborhood in hopes that someone will recognize him and give that information to the police.

Britton is optimistic that the community will help Ron find justice: “A lot of people like that say, I don’t like this either. I’m pro-choice. But what happened to that old man that wasn’t right. And they’ll say, ‘Here’s the guy.’”

On the other hand, Planned Parenthood has not been helpful with apprehending Ron’s attacker, as Britton explains: “Planned Parenthood said that they would not give out their surveillance videos.” It’s also worth pointing out, and emphasizing here, that the unprovoked violence here came not from the pro-life activists, but from the pro-choice passerby.

It’s important to share stories when altercations like this occur because peaceful demonstration and prayer is a protected First Amendment right we must defend. Ron had the right, too, to defend himself and his property. There is no need to passively sit by and let someone destroy your possessions, especially when those possessions are being used to bring truth and hope to others.

Keep Ron and all of those praying for hope during the 40 Days for Life in your prayers, and let’s hope that no further violence occurs.

Media Owes An Apology For Dividing Country With Collusion Hate,"“Apologies all the way around” are due over the Russia collusion hoax, says Sharyl Attkisson’s latest opinion article. The former CBS reporter lays out a road map of how the “wildly unbalanced” media, in pursuit of evidence that President Trump colluded with Russia, spent two years “report[ing] a tremendous amount of false information” and “doubl[ing] down more than we apologized” when “correct[ing] our mistakes.”

In her list of those who deserve an apology for those constant, spurious attacks, Attkisson includes “the American people,” as they “did not receive the full attention of their government while political points were being scored [and] were not told of important world events because they were crowded out of the news by the persistent insistence that Trump was working for Russia.”

Attkisson’s point is important, but she did not take it quite far enough. Americans also deserve an apology for the way that the aforementioned biased media coverage stoked the hate that turned us against one another.

For the past two years, while the media criticized the president for his alleged proliferation of intolerance and hatred, the media self-righteously spewed endless vitriol at the president and his supporters. They gave voice to wanton nonsense exemplified in the April 2017 article from the Worcester Telegram, in which writer Carlo Baldino explained: “Those of us who viewed Trump as a joke and a reprehensible madman were totally shocked by the people in our lives we thought would see him as we did. Instead they rationalized and made excuses for his obnoxious behavior and continued to support him….We thought we knew our friends and family members. We didn’t know they harbored such hatred in their hearts.”

Baldino later posed a “philosophical question”: “If you view the world as a liberal or as a conservative, is there any point in trying to maintain friendships and relationships with people whose view of the world makes you want to throw up? Isn’t life nasty, brutish, and short enough without subjecting yourself to that kind of agita?”

This is a perfect example of the kind of navel-gazing diatribes constantly bombarding the American conscience. The not-so-subtle message underlying such tripe is that all Americans who supported President Trump are deplorable scum, and that anyone who treats a Trump voter as such is to be exculpated.

Russiagate Wasn’t the Only Hoax Aiming to Prove This

In their efforts to prove their thesis, the media leapt at many a false hate crime. The most recent, and most highly publicized, of those hoaxes was put forward by “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett. He claimed in January that he was attacked with homophobic slurs and pro-Trump rhetoric, assaulted, placed in a noose, and attacked with bleach.

Smollett’s alleged attack was covered with extreme bias by such outlets as GQ. Yet within weeks, his every allegation was thoroughly discredited by the incredible work of the Chicago Police Department, although the department’s intense efforts were to the detriment, as Superintendent Eddie Johnson explained, of “every legitimate victim who is in need of support.”

Smollett’s case was not the first of its kind, but it was certainly the most egregious. Yet on March 26, all 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct against Smollett were dropped, showing the tremendous power of the actor’s privilege.

While Smollett’s case was being scrutinized, journalist Andy Ngo compiled a list of falsely reported hate crimes in America. His compilation includes more than 80 incidents from 2015 to the present, in which individuals fabricated claims that they were the targets of hate.

They include Muslims who claimed Trump supporters removed their hijabs, Americans who tagged public spaces with pro-Ku Klux Klan or anti-Semitic graffiti and claimed the messages were left by hateful right-wingers, and black Americans who claimed to have received hateful and threatening notes penned by racist conservatives, among others. Commentary on some of these false incidents, including an article written by the formerly well-respected Washington Post editorial board, was “used…to spite Trump,” according to Ngo.

While scouring for evidence that Trump and his supporters were out in force, spreading their toxic hate, journalists discovered evidence in January that really got the hate train moving. A video that quickly went viral shows Covington Catholic High School boys, many in Make America Great Again hats, waiting on their bus, smiling and chanting along as Native American activist Nathan Phillips steadily pounds his drum in their faces, and Black Hebrew Israelites launch vile verbal attacks. Those boys were transformed in the course of a news cycle into unredeemable white racists.

Twitter swarmed with leftist elites lambasting the boys and suggesting, among other things, throwing them into a wood chipper. By the time additional footage, and the truth, emerged, the damage to the boys’ reputations was irreparable.

Inspiring Hatred Isn’t the Media’s Job

In the court of public opinion, the president and those who support him continue to be charged for their supposed hate. Getting short shrift in the news are those attackers who appear to fall outside the realm of Trump voters.

They include former Democratic volunteer James Polite, who set fires at four Williamsburg Jewish institutions and defaced a Brooklyn synagogue with graffiti reading “Kill All Jews” on November 1. They include a transgender black woman, likely the same suspected in a string of pepper spray attacks in Manhattan, who asked one of her victims whether she was white before pepper-spraying her and her companion’s faces in the Bronx on March 8. They also include the two Tulane University students and one Brown University student who set fire to the Tulane University dorm room door of a Turning Point USA representative and member of Young Americans for Liberty on March 23.

The media circus before, during, and after the 2016 elections has affected every conservative I know. We all have a story. For some, it’s a tale of hiding their political feelings or support for the president out of fear of being ostracized by their peers, many of whom have suddenly been politically mobilized and are out for blood.

Others, like me, who have declared ourselves conservatives or Trump supporters have faced public scrutiny and disgust. We have withstood verbal attacks in bars, at work, over the holiday table, and online, at the hands of friends, colleagues, complete strangers, and family members. There’s a reckoning coming for people who voted for Trump, I was told at Christmas.

On the contrary, a reckoning should be coming for a media which, in pursuit of a smoking gun that would validate their discontent with the president, used trumped-up and downright false information to lead Americans into hating their friends and loved ones.

Unfortunately, Attkisson has another thing right. “Judging by the recent past,” she writes, “apologies are not likely forthcoming.”",https://thefederalist.com/2019/03/29/media-owes-americans-apology-dividing-country-collusion-hate-mongering/,2019-03-29
Nobody In The GOP Is Inciting Violence Against Ilhan Omar,"Words have actual, distinct meanings. Somehow accepting this wisdom that is thousands of years old is something of a struggle in this, the 21st century. I’m not talking about the current confusion over what the words man and woman mean, or if “Western Civilization” describes an actual human phenomenon. Rather, I’m talking about the word “incitement,” and a dishonest campaign by Democrats to argue Republicans are guilty of it.

One thing common to the dictionary definitions of the word “incite” is intent. To incite is to encourage, it is to actively advocate for; it is not a speech or action that inadvertently or negligently causes violence. When Democrats claim, as many have this week, that Republicans are inciting violence towards Rep. Ilhan Omar in their reaction to her statements about 9/11, they are making a specific charge. That charge is “The GOP wants to encourage violence against Omar.”

I’ll be honest: I’m a bit nonplussed by Omar saying “Some people did something” in regard to 9/11. It’s not how I would put it, but I suspect I view the root causes of the attack differently than Omar does. Obviously Omar abhors the attack, but she likely sees its roots as having to do with colonialism in the Middle East. This, along with recently revealed comments in which she suggested a moral relevancy between al-Qaeda and the U.S. Army, suggest a certain type of worldview. And it’s not all that rare.

On college campuses all across America, there are professors who think the United States has been a harmful force — Central America, Vietnam, climate change, using a nuclear bomb, etc. They have their case. I think it’s foolish, but it’s not strange that Omar and other young Democrats in Congress don’t. It’s fairly standard leftist fare. It is also absolutely fair game for political attack.

The real danger in regard to Democrats accusing Republicans like Rep. Dan Crenshaw and Donald Trump, and outlets like the New York Post, of incitement to violence is that the charge is one of very few that can be used to erase First Amendment free speech protections. It’s no accident that this is the word being used. But it is an absurd accusation.

No Democrat will actually say that Crenshaw, Trump, or the New York Post editors desire harm to come to Omar, because obviously they don’t. And that takes incitement off the table. What they are saying, in classic progressive tones, is that Omar is a member of a vulnerable, marginalized minority, so attacks on her carry an extra threat of violence.

It is hard to know if this is true, but it might be. Omar has been the subject of death threats, including the arrest of one man. Perhaps Omar’s critics should take extra care in framing their attacks. But Omar is a public figure, a politician thrust into vast prominence and influence. She has to be fair game for direct criticism. And her identity cannot be allowed to transform a plain political attack into an incitement to violence.

Last year, many in the liberal press applauded the public abuse of Trump officials in restaurants. This was the people having their voice! Even Democratic members of Congress urged this kind of direct action. Can they really claim that public confrontation with politicians is less likely to lead to violence than criticism of a Muslim politician’s speech? If telling people to get in GOP officials’ faces isn’t incitement to violence — and it isn’t — then how can criticism of a congresswoman euphemizing the attacks of 9/11 possibly be?

My father has a piece of advice that he is perhaps overly fond of giving me. “Speak with particularity,” he says. It’s good advice. Frankly, my fear about Democrats’ misuse of “incite” is not that they do not know their error, but that they know it very well. My fear is that they intend to change what the word means, because there are no rules, and take away fundamental speech rights in the coming decades.

If Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez thinks Republicans are inciting violence by attacking Omar, can we doubt she would pursue hate speech laws that would police Americans’ speech in ways unimaginable two decades ago? The presidential candidates on the Democratic side are once again echoing her. It seems like they have gotten hooked on a progressive smack that is hard to beat. Well, hard for them to beat — maybe not for Trump.

Obviously Republicans can’t and won’t be cowed by these crazy claims that they are inciting violence. Let’s hope the Democrats come to understand how absurd it is as well.

"No, Omar And Ocasio-Cortez Are Not The Real Victims Of 9/11","The controversy over Rep. Ilhan Omar’s trivialization of the 9/11 attacks has continued unabated, with top Democrats like presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren claiming Omar is a victim and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi blasting President Trump for criticizing Omar.

For those on vacation last week, here are the comments that led to the current firestorm:

https://twitter.com/Imamofpeace/status/1115454942536327168

In recent days, we have been treated to the bizarre spectacle of leftists and media mouthpieces pretending that Omar’s reference to “some people” was no different than President George W. Bush standing atop the rubble of the World Trade Center promising justice for the nearly 3,000 people killed in the worst terror attack ever on American soil. Equally bizarre is the defense that these comments were less bad when heard in context. In reality, the comments are worse in context.

Omar’s dismissal of 9/11 as just “something” that happened was in service of the falsehood that the group to which she was speaking—the Council for American Islamic Relations (CAIR)—was founded after 9/11 to defend the civil liberties of American Muslims. But CAIR was founded in 1994. In context, Omar is downplaying mass murder in the service of suggesting that American Muslims were the real victims of 9/11.

The spike in reported hate crimes against Muslims after 9/11 was shameful. But it is possible to condemn those crimes without trivializing the terror attacks themselves, unless the agenda is something other than the truth.

The attempt to mythologize CAIR as a response to America’s post-9/11 bigotry is particularly odious in light of the organization’s true history. As federal district judge Jorge Solis found during the Holy Land Foundation (HLF) trials—the largest terrorism financing case in American history—the government “produced ample evidence to establish the association[] of CAIR… with HLF… and with Hamas” sufficient to name CAIR as an unindicted co-conspirator.

Our government did not designate HLF as a terror group until December 2001, but it designated Hamas in 1995. It has long been apparent what Hamas is. After 9/11, Hamas leader Sheikh Yassin said “no doubt this is a result of injustice the U.S practices against the weak in the world.”

Omar displayed a similar mindset in a recently surfaced 2013 interview. Here is the clip circulating on social media, in which Omar complains that people (one of her professors in particular) refer to al-Qaeda and Hezbollah with a weighty tone they do not give to America or our Army:

What kind of sick monster would find comedy in the words Al-Qaeda and Hezbollah and compare those two terrorist organizations to America and the U.S. Army? Rep. Ilhan Omar. That’s who. pic.twitter.com/YyyuddzGMi — ForAmerica (@ForAmerica) April 12, 2019

Omar and her defenders will claim the clip is taken out of context. But if you watch the entire interview, it is another case where the full context is worse. Omar makes clear she is making a general cultural observation. Moreover, the interview reveals she subscribes to the view that terrorism is simply a reaction to atrocities and oppression committed by governments, and faults those who do not view the subject this way (11:40-12:40).

Omar’s mentality manifests itself in her view of Israel, including her infamous anti-Semitic rant about Israel hypnotizing the world. It also manifests in her delusional view that where a socialist dictator like Nicolas Maduro is starving and abusing the people of Venezuela, the real fear is that America is plotting a right-wing coup by supporting a legitimate, democratic socialist alternative.

It more generally manifests in her apparent view that America was the villain during the Cold War. And it manifests in a speech to CAIR that suggests the real victims of 9/11 were not the 2,977 people who died, along with their families.

One fair point Omar made in the 2013 interview: it must be annoying as a Somali-American that she should be expected to condemn every incident of radical Islamic terrorism. This would have been and would be less of a problem if the left were not so often committed to denying the role a radical theology plays in groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS. But the annoyance remains understandable.

Yet with Omar in particular, the annoyance is astoundingly hypocritical. She is entirely a creature of identity politics. She and her ilk routinely respond to criticism of her far-left, anti-Semitic agenda by accusing her critics of racism, sexism, and Islamophobia. She is greatly annoyed at having to say “not all Muslims,” but spends many of her waking hours spewing prejudiced views about Jews, Caucasians, men, Republicans, and so on.

Omar and her defenders have taken this approach to a new low with their monolithic assertion that Omar cannot be criticized because it threatens her life. Obviously, death threats against Omar, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, or anyone else are to be condemned in the strongest terms.

Yet the idea that public officials should be immune from criticism simply because evil or mentally ill people exist in our world is profoundly undemocratic. Moreover, it is an assertion based in the guilt by association mentality that irks Omar so much when directed her way.

Furthermore, if this assertion were applied as a standard, supporters of Sanders, like Ocasio-Cortez, should still be keeping their mouths shut because a Bernie Bro attempted to assassinate a group of GOP representatives and seriously wounded Rep. Steve Scalise. Also given that there are far more reported hate crimes against Jews than Muslims in America, Omar should have resolved to remain silent in the wake of her string of anti-Semitic attacks on supporters of Israel and her support of the anti-Semitic boycott, divest, and sanctions movement.

Of course, the left would never accept their undemocratic claim as a universal standard because progressivism is not about standards. Rather it is the political version of Calvinball, where the “rules” change whenever it empowers the left. Omar trivializes a heinous act of terror to promote her politics of victimhood, but Republicans are the real villains for “pouncing” on it, i.e., criticizing her disgusting remarks.

Indeed, Ocasio-Cortez now wants to hide behind the notion that reminding people of the tragedy of the 9/11 attacks is wrong because it is “triggering”:

AOC on NY Post/Ilhan Omar front page: “We are getting to the level where this is an incitement of violence against progressive women of color and if they can’t figure out how to get it back to policy, we need to call it out for what it is because this is not normal.” pic.twitter.com/Zxad5H4I8n — Jason Donner (@jason_donner) April 11, 2019

No one on the right was rubbing the noses of leftists like Omar and Ocasio-Cortez in the 9/11 attacks until Omar decided to trivialize them and people like Ocasio-Cortez decided to defend Omar. “Never forget” is an entirely appropriate response, no matter how much the left wants to squeal about it.

This Hate Crime Helps Show How To Know Real Ones From Hoaxes,"In national conversations about hate crimes, members of the media tend to rely on emotional rhetoric rather than rational evaluation of the facts. Despite aggravated assault making up 19.5 percent of hate crimes in 2017, the idea of random acts of hate-motivated violence inspires most of the fear and activism against hate crimes nationwide. Of the total number of hate crimes affecting persons in 2017 in all categories, 79 percent were nonviolent.

To the public imagination, though, the concept of hate crimes conjures images of innocent people being targeted and brutally attacked merely for who they are. Despite many highly publicized incidents turning out to be hoaxes, hate crimes still drive a great deal of media attention. We have become accustomed to making arguments decrying the potential for true victims to be further victimized by lack of public trust in media and that real hate crimes do still happen. Here is an example of one of those true cases.

In July 2018, around 3:30 a.m., 24-year-old Brandon M. Wiley told the police that a 39-year-old gay man propositioned him and grabbed him in a sexual manner. In response, he beat the man, then later posted bloody pictures of himself on social media bragging about the assault.

The victim of the assault was found by police after a security guard witnessed the assault and suffered “multiple serious facial injuries, including a broken nose and fractured orbital sockets.” In April 2019, Wiley pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and police confirmed with video and witnesses that the victim had not molested him. Hate crime charges have been added, and Wiley is scheduled for sentencing in June.

What Makes This Hate Crime Plausible?

Multiple factors of this story illustrate the anatomy of a true hate crime. The first, and most important factor, was a neutral third party. A security guard just happened to pass by when the assault happened and was able to see specific details. Witnesses are one of the most important pieces of evidence as they allow more than one perspective to the crime. Hoax hate crimes often lack eyewitnesses or, if one is present, such witnesses have a bias towards the victim and may not be an objective source of truth.

In addition to eyewitnesses, the most affecting source of evidence comes from video or audio recordings of the event. In this case, security cameras caught the entire interaction between the two individuals. This allowed the police a straightforward view into the factual events. Security footage may not reveal verbal evidence, but in this case the attacker claimed the victim first assaulted him by grabbing his crotch. This was quickly disproven by the video evidence.

Police found the victim lying on the ground where the assault occurred, and he was taken to the hospital. Immediately going to the hospital is a powerful indicator of legitimate injury also, as it does not allow for staging or exaggeration of events.

Again, the victim had multiple witnesses to his injuries and was evaluated by medical professionals rather than taking a bloody selfie and posting it on social media or waiting until later to go to the hospital. The police were informed by a third party, in this case the security guard, and allowed the facts to be objectively recorded without outside influence. The first person to interact with the victim post-attack was the police officer, which significantly strengthens the case.

One of the most revealing aspects of this case is the pride the attacker took in his actions. He posted pictures of himself immediately afterwards, positioning himself as the victim and bragging about severely beating the man. He clearly intended for the public to know his motivations and felt justified in his actions.

A widely overlooked aspect in the narrative about a hateful population intentionally targeting minorities for violence is that we rarely see attackers bragging about their actions. It would seem reasonable that if people truly despise LGBT people to such an extent that they feel compelled to physically attack them in public, there would be more public celebration of such attacks.

Perpetrator Motives and Victim Reaction

A Texas study of hate crimes found that most reported hate crimes never identify a suspect and many are dismissed due to little or no evidence. It seems that the media assumes perpetrators of hate crimes simply wish to attack individuals of hated groups for the satisfaction alone rather than as a (perceived) political or social message.

In this case, the victim did admit to the police to propositioning the attacker. While a wildly inappropriate response, it is at least a reason that explains the attack. Too often we are simply asked to believe random citizens roam the streets looking for members of marginalized groups to assault for the sheer joy of the act.

Another unique property of this crime is that it took several months to collect sufficient evidence to properly prosecute the attacker with local reports updating the case. Too often, hate crimes receive a large, public announcement and rarely involve resolution or follow-up. This case was reported locally and in several LGBT news sources, but never achieved nationwide attention or outrage. This allowed the police and prosecution to gather evidence and build a case.

One overlooked quality of this case that significantly distinguishes it from most reported hate crimes is that the victim is not publicly named. Typically, an alleged victim immediately turns to social media or the press and tells his or her story before any investigation can be conducted.

In this case, even though he was viciously beaten over a minor infraction, he chose not to take this route. He was attacked, went to the hospital, gave an honest police report, and allowed justice to be properly served as he healed and rebuilt his life. While he deserves public sympathy for the attack, he did not seek fame or money. This says a great deal about the legitimacy of the incident.

Would Extra Laws Really Deter Hate Crimes? Not Likely

This was a hate crime because the attacker reacted to the proposition with extreme violence and bragged about attacking the victim, a gay man. The gay man took a chance in a moment of weakness late at night in a bar, and did not deserve to be viciously beaten. But an important question is: what law would have prevented this attack?

Although a terrible situation and unfortunate experience of engaging with the wrong person in the wrong scenario, the assault on its own was already illegal. Although a hate crime charge increases sentencing, is this going to influence Wiley’s future choices or his views on gay men or his own sexuality, which inspired the assault to begin with? Will the hate crime charges prevent a similar irrational young man from doing the same?

One of the unfortunate rhetorical media reactions, especially in LGBT advocacy, is the outrage that the violent incident occurred in the first place. They insist the same could happen to all LGBT people nationwide, and that the incident is evidence of a larger pattern. But this situation is far more of an outlier than a pattern. In fact, it’s the bold honesty of the attacker about his motivations that makes this story stand out as shocking and disturbing. Our collective agreement that this is morally wrong should be evidence enough that no one supports violence against LGBT people.

It is equally as important to recognize legitimate hate crimes as it is to report on the abuse of public sympathy and compassion with high-profile hoaxes. We should recognize that, despite the unfair imbalance of hoaxes to legitimate crimes, the police take reports seriously and do everything in their power to get justice for victims.

Unfortunately, it takes a real hate crime with a satisfying resolution for us to appreciate just how safe and protected LGBT individuals are in our society. The police and our justice system should be thanked for this.

Democrat Attacks On Barr Mean Appointing A Second Special Counsel,"U.S. Attorney General William Barr’s recognition that spying on the Donald Trump campaign occurred and that “spying on a political campaign is a big deal” incited congressional Democrats and liberal pundits to condemn Barr.

Barr “is acting as an employee of the president,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer charged, adding that he thinks “the attorney general believes he needs to protect the president of the United States.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told the Associated Press “she didn’t trust Barr and suggested his statements undermined his credibility as America’s chief law enforcement officer.” Meanwhile Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer took to Twitter to accuse Barr of “peddling conspiracy theories,” and media personalities tweeted out attacks on the attorney general, calling him untrustworthy.

Democrats and the mainstream media seem oblivious to the implication of their attacks on Barr’s independence: Barr’s supposed lack of independence would justify the appointment of a second special counsel, this one to investigate the initiation and handling of the investigation into Trump and the Trump campaign.

Since evidence of misconduct by the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court order to spy on former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page first made headlines, many high-profile Republicans have demanded the appointment of a second special counsel to probe the abuse. But former attorney general Jeff Sessions rebuffed the requests and instead directed Utah U.S. Attorney John Huber to work with the inspector general’s office to investigate the claims of misconduct.

Nothing has come of Huber’s investigation—at least publicly. There is also reason to doubt that anything would come from the probe given evidence suggesting the FBI has already ended an investigation into dossier author Christopher Steele without any charges forthcoming.

Unless Barr intervenes, that is, which his recent congressional testimony suggests is likely: “I feel I have an obligation to make sure that government power was not abused,” the attorney general told the Senate appropriations sub-committee last Wednesday. Barr added that he is “concerned about whether improper surveillance occurred and is looking into it.”

Barr’s statements give conservatives hope that the misconduct of anti-Trump zealots will not go unexposed and unpunished. Democrats seem fearful of this possibility and seek to shackle Barr by attacking his independence and credibility. But rather than deter Barr from investigating Spygate, the Democrats’ criticism of the attorney general can only lead to one result: the appointment of a special counsel.

By regulation, the attorney general is directed to “appoint a Special Counsel when he or she determines that criminal investigation of a person or matter is warranted and that the investigation or prosecution of that person or matter by a United States Attorney’s Office or litigating Division of the Department of Justice would present a conflict of interest for the Department or other extraordinary circumstances.” Additionally, it must be “in the public interest to appoint an outside Special Counsel to assume responsibility for the matter.”

There is already sufficient evidence to justify a criminal investigation related to the Russia collusion probe, whether it be the false statements Steele made to the FBI, or those contained in the FISA applications and attested to by numerous FBI and the DOJ officials. The numerous leaks that spurred on the Russia collusion hoax also provide ample cause to launch a criminal investigation into the matter.

So if Democrats want to cry conflict, fine: Barr can appoint a special counsel to oversee the matter. In fact, were Democrats truly concerned about the propriety of the investigation, they would be demanding a special counsel to ensure that the investigation—led by a Trump-appointee—does not devolve into a vindictive witch hunt against political opponents.

Will anyone in the mainstream media make this point? Not likely. But hopefully congressional Republicans will recognize the significance of the left’s rhetoric and call on their colleagues to join them in supporting the appointment of a special counsel.

The Bombshell In The Mueller Report Is Russia’s Social Media Campaign,"It’s over. The Mueller Report is upon us and it says what Attorney General William Barr said it would say. Nobody in the Trump campaign—in fact, no American citizen at all—colluded or conspired with the Russian government to impact the 2016 election. This is obviously good news for the country and a vindication for the president who has protested his innocence quite vociferously from the beginning.

But the findings of the report were not unalloyed good news. In one area, in particular, Mueller found deeply troubling activities from the Russians. The section on Russia’s informational campaign using social media to influence the election is damning and shocking. Much of the information it presents was already known, but seen summarized by Mueller, what they achieved was astounding.

Conducted by the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian government-backed social media troll farm, the extent and reach of the operations is astounding. Collectively, the report says, “The IRA’s social media accounts reached 10s of millions of US persons.” It also controlled Facebook groups such as “United Muslims of America,” that had 300,000 followers when it was shut down in 2017.

In total the report says that at least 29 million and perhaps as many as 126 million people were reached by the propaganda campaigns. The danger of this is not merely that the propaganda might help determine the outcome of viewers’ voting decisions. What is far worse is that, on that scale, the Russians can make fringe, divisive positions and rhetoric appear to Americans to be, if not mainstream, at least vastly more prominent than they really are.

Even the news media was not immune to these efforts. The report outlines that on multiple occasions “U.S. media outlets also quoted tweets from IRA-controlled accounts and attributed them to the reactions of real U.S. persons.” It is very possible, if not likely that the real target of the IRA was not to sway an election, but rather to sow discord and distrust among Americans. And it looks like the news media was an unwitting accomplice.

Sometimes IRA social media operations even reached beyond the screen and into real life. Dozens of rallies, some of which had hundreds of attendees, were organized by the IRA. Their sinister scheme involved creating well-followed interest groups on Facebook (on either side of the political spectrum) and then announcing a live event. Group followers who showed interest were then contacted and made event coordinators. Unbeknownst to the coordinators, or the attendees, their rally was really a Russian propaganda put-up job.

All of this should shock Americans, especially since Russia is not the only country engaged in these kinds of social media informational attacks. I wrote in June of last year, after attending the National Security Seminar at the Army War College, that the military and defense department take these attacks incredibly seriously and that they are incredibly difficult to defend against. At the time I wrote:

“While an ultimate good, freedom of speech is also a dangerous hole in our ability to defend against the growing threat of propaganda operations. Our primary foreign adversaries—Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea—are all repressive regimes vastly more capable of defending against propaganda. If speech is being used to sow division and discord in those nations, they just squash it. They shut down websites, close newspapers, and even kill journalists. These are defensive options that thankfully our government cannot use.”

Since the government has little leverage, that leaves it to the social media companies themselves to police their content for foreign political interference, but as congressional testimony from the heads of Facebook and Twitter has shown, these companies have no earthly idea how to do it. When asked, they tend to mumble something about the potential of artificial intelligence to someday weed out bad actors.

The situation is not good and there do not seem to be any optimal solutions. In any sane political time we would see a bipartisan effort to create new approaches to defend against foreign social media informational attacks. But our current political divisions are making this impossible. Both sides share some blame for this.

Democrats, with their wild and irresponsible promises of collusion between Trump and Russia, set expectations so high that Trump being cleared of collusion makes the information campaign seem like small potatoes. Meanwhile, Trump and too many Republicans have downplayed the attacks as a mere excuse for why Hillary Clinton lost. Now that the Mueller report is out and Trump has been cleared, both sides should be able to move to the center and accept the true nature of Russian interference—but that won’t happen.

Instead, Democrats will continue to try to catch the great orange whale, this time with a harpoon of obstruction. Reasonable people may or may not be able to agree if obstruction took place but, even if it did, Trump has not been charged so the only recourse would be congressional investigation and potential impeachment. Meanwhile, the actual threat remains lost behind the sound and fury of allegations against the president.

Now is the time for good actors on both sides—Marco Rubio or Mitt Romney (who knows about the threat Russia poses, if you recall) on the right, and perhaps people like Joe Manchin or Chris Coons on the left—to bring attention to, and seek solutions to, the problem of Russian social media informational attacks.

But some of the responsibility also falls on us, the citizens of the United States. Know that the awful anonymous tweet you see might just be foreign propaganda. Don’t assume the worst about those with whom you disagree. Because that is exactly what Russia has been trying to make you do, and in far too many cases, they’ve been succeeding.

Here's What Rep. Ilhan Omar Gets Wrong About 'Black Hawk Down',"Earlier this week, a 2017 tweet from Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) surfaced in which she attacked the men who helped defend from starvation and civil war the country she abandoned in the early 1990s. In her tweet, Omar blasted “American forces” for killing “thousands of Somalis” during the Battle of Mogadishu in October 1993. “#NotTodaySatan,” Omar wrote.

I take special exception to Omar’s disgusting comments because I served in the Battle of Mogadishu, which was later portrayed in the movie “Black Hawk Down.” If you aren’t familiar with the real story behind “Black Hawk Down,” let me set the scene for you.

In late 1992, President George H. W. Bush launched Operation Restore Hope in support of United Nations initiatives to restore some semblance of law and order to Somalia, which was wracked by devastating famine and violent warlords eager to use the chaos and hopelessness to establish corrupt fiefdoms.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byL_rW8n-Ow?start=132

The purpose of American involvement in Somalia was to protect the peacekeepers tasked with the near-impossible mission of delivering vital food and medical supplies to the starving, war-torn population. As the aid grew, so did the opportunities for graft from warring clans who saw the humanitarian crisis as a way to cement their power throughout the country.

The Habar Gidir clan, one of the more powerful clans around Mogadishu, was led by the notorious warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid, who made the distribution of international aid to those who needed it nearly impossible. Instead of equitably spreading food and medical supplies, Aidid and his henchmen spread terror and death.

On June 5, 1993, two dozen Pakistani soldiers working for the United Nations peacekeeping effort were attacked and killed by forces loyal to Farah Aidid (three Americans were injured in that attack as well). The next day, the U.N. passed a resolution condemning the attack and calling for the arrest of those responsible and of those inciting and organizing other attacks against U.N. forces. The man most responsible for the violence was Aidid himself, who unilaterally declared himself president (he was never recognized as a legitimate political leader).

Task Force Ranger was the 1993 military effort ordered by President Bill Clinton to capture Aidid and his lieutenants so the U.N. could deliver food and medical aid without fear of being attacked or killed by Aidid’s forces. The American soldiers Omar attacked in her tweet — the men of Task Force Ranger –weren’t sent to Somalia for fame or fortune. They weren’t there because of a deep desire to visit the God-forsaken nation of Somalia. They were deployed to support peacekeepers who were desperate to rescue the country from starvation and the ravages of civil war. To do that, they had to capture the men responsible for it.

By the time Task Force Ranger had been launched, Aidid’s network of drug-addled, Khat-dealing gun runners had taken over Mogadishu and were doing everything they could to oppress any and all rival clans, including that of Omar, the Majeerteen. In other words, we were sent halfway across the world to help protect people just like Omar and her family. Nineteen incredible men gave their lives defending her country while serving ours. They deserve to be lauded for their service, not attacked for it.

I am thankful Omar and her family and countless others were able to escape to neighboring Kenya while we fought to protect those left behind, but I simply cannot comprehend her attitude towards those of us who fought to protect her country and countrymen from warlords who plunged Somalia only further into violence and starvation. I am glad that Omar can now enjoy the very freedoms we fought to protect, like the freedom of speech and the free exercise of religion affirmed in the U.S. Constitution, but I don’t understand why she uses those freedoms to slur the men and women of the U.S. military who made her security and liberty a reality.

The simple truth is that Omar enjoys the fruits of American combat deaths, yet she can’t even bring herself to acknowledge the ultimate sacrifice that was made on her behalf, either as a Somali or an American. Her clan didn’t stand a chance against Aidid and Habar Gidirs, so I don’t blame her for leaving. But I do blame her for attacking those of us who had zero personal interest or investment in her nation for doing our jobs on behalf of our country. And I blame her for smearing American servicemen because we answered the call of our nation to address the violent barbarism of hers.

Unlike Omar, I’m not a politician. I don’t have power or influence. I don’t have a vote in Congress or the ability to direct America’s foreign policy. I’m just one of the men who strapped it on as a member of Task Force Ranger and went into harm’s way to help bring peace and security to her and her people. And let me tell you, she missed a helluva fight.

Sri Lanka Attacks Highlight Growing Worldwide Persecution Of Christians,"On one of the holiest days of the Christian calendar, on Easter Sunday suicide bombers attacked and killed more than 200 people worshipping at Christian churches in three separate locations in Sri Lanka. While no group has taken responsibility for these actions, the tactics were borrowed from jihadist playbooks, and Islamic State supporters have cheered on the bombing, calling it “revenge” for past injustices against Muslims.

These attacks are only the latest and deadliest in an uptick of violence against the Christian minorities in Sri Lanka, who make up 17 percent of the populace. In 2018, Buddhist extremists burned down both Muslim-owned shops and Christian churches across the country, while the state police and civil authorities were criticized for not adopting stronger measures to protect the religious minorities targeted.

Violence against Christians spreads far beyond Sri Lanka. Pew Research lists Christians as the most harassed faith in the world, with significant levels of persecution in 144 countries, according to 2016 data. People of all faiths should care about this, because the world climate is growing increasingly hostile to religious freedom as religious fundamentalism creeps into national politics and people increasingly define themselves in opposition to other people’s faiths.

The idea of religious toleration, a proud feature of some parts of Middle Eastern history, is losing currency among a fundamentalist wave in the region. Throughout the twenty-first century, more than 2 million Christians have been displaced from countries like Egypt, Syria, and Iraq due to the effects of Islamic fundamentalism and sectarian violence in the region. Few groups have suffered as Christian minorities have due to the rise of Islamist political parties such as the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and ISIS in Libya, with arson, displacement, and even beheadings occurring in these persecutory domains.

It is not just backwards Islamist regimes who are persecuting Christians, either. China’s authoritarian atheist government, fearful of the revolutionary potential of Christian minorities, is tightening its restrictions on the country’s Christians, enforcing its laws against Chinese “house churches” (churches that operate outside the purview of the official state church) and evangelistic speech with greater severity than in previous years.

South Asia is also becoming a hotbed for anti-Christian persecution. According to Open Doors USA, an organization tracking Christian persecution across the world, Indian Christians now face an “extreme” level of persecution, up from “high” just five years ago, due to spikes in Hindu extremism targeting churches, as well as halfhearted government responses failing to protect these minorities. Open Doors USA now claims with evidence that one in three Christians in all of Asia currently face some form of persecution.

Even in the enlightened West, religious freedom is facing its biggest challenge in centuries. Journalists have reported a record 47 documented desecrations of church property in France for February 2019. In Germany, three-quarters of resettled Christian refugees claim to experience persecution, mostly from the Muslim refugees which surround them. The number of attacks on Catholic churches in the whole of Europe is already up 25 percent compared to the number of attacks during a similar period last year.

While many European journalists rightly blame mass migration from majority-Muslim countries for these religious persecution issues, migration is not the only factor here. Just as significant is Western Europe’s culture of enforced secularism, a world where religious speech is policed and religious symbols (such as burqas) are not allowed in French public schools or German business settings.

Western Europe no longer inspires religious freedom. Western Europe is instead now a land where public religion is actively discouraged, a world where religious differences are often hashed out in the dark rather than debated in the daylight.

No matter your faith, we should be concerned about the state of religious freedom in the world today. For thousands of years, the world had little concept of religious freedom—you were whatever religion your prince was, cuius regio, eius religio—but the death of millions in the Thirty Years’ War in Europe finally shook the continent into adopting rudimentary principles of religious toleration, to keep everyone from slaughtering each other.

These principles were eventually condensed into a single line in the U.S. Constitution, that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” That’s the first line of the First Amendment.

It took thousands of years and millions of lives to enshrine the principle of freedom of religion into the liberal tradition of governance. Just when we Americans thought we could export this principle to the rest of the world, instead we are seeing it crumble before our very eyes, with Christian minorities harassed and persecuted for their faith in ways we’d never dreamt of.

Christian minorities are just one religious group facing persecution across the world. One only need to remember the horrific shooting of 50 Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand to understand that religious persecution cuts across all faiths. Many of the same attacks against Christians are made against Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, and Jewish minorities all over the world. Today, however, the horrible Sri Lankan bombings have cast Christian minorities in the world’s tragic spotlight.

The persecution of religious minorities across the world should make all Americans here grateful for our country’s stronger protections religious freedom, despite their legal and cultural erosions. It should remind us that these freedoms are never free, and that they must be guarded jealously against illiberal forces that seek to undermine them in the courts and in the court of public opinion. And it should motivate us to stop being complacent while people of many faiths bear sickening persecution for practicing what they believe.

"If Democrats Try To ‘Benghazi’ Trump, They’ll Only Hurt Themselves","Do Democrats have a successful template to follow in their investigations against President Donald Trump? According to a recent Politico article, their model may be the same strategy they deplored only a few years ago when Republican rivals employed it. Rather than impeach Trump or even Attorney General William Barr, they can Benghazi him.

Democrats spent the last two years hoping that Special Counsel Robert Mueller would take down the Trump administration with charges that substantiated their allegations that he had colluded with the Russians to win the presidency. That didn’t happen, so now they face the problem of how to leverage Mueller’s report to their political advantage without outing themselves as partisan obstructionists focused on re-litigating the 2016 election. The same quandary applies to the multiple investigations into Trump’s finances and business practices prior to becoming president that Democrat-controlled House committees are in the process of launching.

The answer, according to some Democrats, is that they should follow the strategy Republicans pursued during the second Obama administration. Since impeachment is a dead end that Democratic leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi want no part in and that would fail in the Senate, the party needs something that would channel the energy and anger of their base against Trump into a constructive format while not setting them up for confrontations that might benefit the GOP. That leads them to the conclusion that they should copy the strategy congressional Republicans pursued from 2012 to 2016 as they investigated what happened during the terror attack on Benghazi that led to the death of four Americans.

While Congress has just as much right to investigate Trump now as it did Barack Obama while he was in the White House, Democrats ought to think twice about going down this road. While some Republicans may think the Benghazi probes helped pave the way for their 2016 victory, it can be argued that the obsession with Benghazi did as much harm to the GOP as it did to Obama.

Even if the discussion about Benghazi burdened former secretary of state Hillary Clinton—the focus of much of the Republicans’ efforts—it didn’t derail her presidential campaign. Moreover, Democrats aren’t likely to cull as much from their desire to go back down the Russia collusion rabbit hole or the deep dive into Trump’s business record as the sparse returns the GOP got from Benghazi.

What Led to the Benghazi Investigations

The shocking terror attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012, was a low point in the Obama administration. Libya’s descent into chaos following the intervention by the United States and its allies that led to the collapse of the despotic regime of dictator Muammar Gaddafi was a blow to Obama’s foreign policy. For most Americans, though, Benghazi was about the deaths of four Americans, including the brutal murder of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens.

Congressional investigations sought to find out how and why the State Department and the U.S. military failed to come to the Americans’ rescue. Yet nothing the various committees found contradicted the initial report by the State Department’s Accountability Review Board that found that Clinton and her staff had been negligent in ensuring the safety of U.S. personnel in Benghazi. It did not substantiate the charge that Obama and Clinton had deliberately delayed the U.S. response to the attack. While some of those involved believed that Washington could have done more to save Stevens and the other three, that allegation was never clearly proved.

But the real embarrassment was the investigation into why both Obama and Clinton sought to falsely characterize the attack as a protest about a video that attacked Muslims. This claim was put forward first by talking points the CIA prepared that sought to downplay the idea that Benghazi was a terrorist attack. This was false, as well as being politically motivated by a desire on the part of the administration to quash any idea that Islamist terror was still a problem. With Obama’s re-election campaign claiming that the death of Osama bin Laden had ended the threat, Benghazi was an untimely reminder that those boasts were untrue.

People Saw Right Through the Spin

The shameful attempts to spin the Benghazi attacks as the fault of a protest about a video were made even worse by the allegation that Clinton had spoken that obvious untruth to one of the parents of the fallen Americans. But as egregious as that might have been, those lies broke no laws even if the attempt to obfuscate the truth about Benghazi undermined any traction the GOP may have gotten from the attack in the 2012 presidential election.

While the episode was a disgrace, all a Senate committee probe, four separate House committee investigations, and the creation of a special House Select Committee on Benghazi achieved was keeping the issue alive. Clinton’s exasperated and inappropriate response to a question during one of the times she was forced to testify about Benghazi—“What difference does it make?”—was continually thrown in her face when she was running for president in 2016.

Yet the avalanche of committee probes did nothing to resolve the country’s doubts about the incident and ultimately no one was held accountable for the failure to rescue the four Americans. Democrats could respond that all of the energy expended on Benghazi was a deeply cynical and disproportionate political vendetta against Clinton and a vast waste of time and resources by Congress.

Democrats deplored the GOP’s obsession with Benghazi at the time. But faced with the demands of the anti-Trump “resistance” that they use their House majority to do all possible to attack the administration, the Benghazi model may seem more attractive to them today. Keeping Trump on the defensive by inundating him with requests for information and endless hearings could help the Democrats in 2020. And if they walk away with a moment in which Trump might provide them a quote that was as embarrassing as Clinton’s gaffe, perhaps it might be worth it.

Dem’s Won’t Succeed Where Mueller Failed

But the problem with the analogy is that Mueller effectively foreclosed any chance of the Democrats finding investigative gold. While the GOP could claim that the State Department’s internal investigative into Benghazi couldn’t be considered objective or conclusive, Mueller’s deep dive into anything remotely related to the Trump campaign and Russia yielded nothing proving collusion, and he refrained from pushing a dubious obstruction of justice charge against the president.

If Democrats could mock Republicans for obsessing about Benghazi, how much more could Trump and the GOP say if Democrats spend the next year seeking what Mueller’s comprehensive probe said didn’t exist?

The Benghazi probes may have chipped away at Clinton’s image, although they paled in comparison to the problems she caused herself with a self-inflicted wound over her emails and her cavalier attitude toward security. But there’s little the Democrats could find out about Trump that both supporters and critics don’t already know.

He won an election while refusing to release his tax returns and after being exposed by the “Access Hollywood” tape as being a self-confessed assaulter of women. In that sense, much as the Democrats keep laboring under the delusion that investigations can damage him, he is politically bulletproof against their allegations, since nothing they find will influence his backers or lessen the animosity of his opponents.

But if Democrats remain as obsessed with trying to undo the 2016 results as Republicans were with Benghazi, they can do themselves harm. That will make it appear as if they are the ones pursuing a political vendetta when they should be doing the people’s business, the same accusation lobbed at the GOP with good effect during their Benghazi probes.

As Republicans learned, the circus atmosphere of congressional hearings tarnishes everyone connected with the exercise. Partisans may relish them and, as with the GOP base with respect to Benghazi, the Resistance will not be satisfied with anything less than an all-out effort to get Trump. But if Democrats think they are enhancing their chances of winning 2020 by falling into the same ideological trap as Republicans did, they are making a mistake.

Skyrocketing Attacks On NYC Jews Ignored Because Of Race,"Imagine that members of a religious minority were being frequently physically assaulted in America’s largest city at alarming rates. Imagine if members of that minority were being cold-cocked or spit on randomly for doing nothing more than being who they are and dressing how they dress. Imagine what a powerful and important story this would be to our country, how mobilized the media and government would be to stop it. But what if I told you that this is happening in New York City right now, and nobody seems to care very much? How can this be? I’ll explain it.

Orthodox Jews in New York City, specifically in Brooklyn, have experienced alarming rates of physical assault over the past year. The New York Police Department says that hate crimes in the city are up 67 percent this year. Of those, a whopping 80 percent have been anti-Semitic hate crimes. Just this week an Orthodox Jew just walking down the street was attacked from behind, punched in the head by an attacker who then ran away. In another incident this week, an Orthodox Jew was attacked by a group of men, one of whom shouted “You (expletive) Jew.”

This is an all too familiar story in Brooklyn these days, and there is a reason it isn’t being treated as a crisis by our media or government. That reason is that many if not most of the assailants are black or Hispanic men. In an article in The New York Times last October that was careful to point out, although without much evidence, that people of all descriptions are committing acts of anti-Semitism, Ginia Bellafante writes (emphasis mine), “In fact, it is the varied backgrounds of people who commit hate crimes in the city that make combating and talking about anti-Semitism in New York much harder.”

We should be clear about what this means. It means that if these assaults were being committed by white men in hoods or MAGA hats, it would not be “hard to talk about.” It would be a clear-cut case of bigotry that needs to be fought with every tool in our arsenal. Instead, journalists are wringing their hands about intersectionality, and careful not to indulge the narrative that these physical attacks are coming from blacks and Hispanics in bordering neighborhoods, even though that narrative is absolutely true.

I know this because I have done it myself. Back in February I wrote about these attacks and I wrote some things that I now regret and want to apologize to the Orthodox community for. I wrote that Orthodox Jews are a “strange set of neighbors,” and their insular ways lead to tension in communities. In retrospect, and through some Orthodox Jews who reached out to me, I see that this was not acceptable, that in fact, I was in some way blaming these Jews for their own assaults.

Just as bad, I was making excuses for these attackers, trying to a find a far more nuanced take than I ever would if the assailants were white men. Even as someone who writes often about race double standards in the media, I fell straight into the trap. I found it “hard to talk about” without placing some blame on both sides.

There is nothing wrong with taking historical racial prejudice into account when writing about racial tension. A conscientious journalist should have worries about painting groups with too broad a brush or promoting stereotypes, but this must be balanced with telling the truth and giving a story the attention it needs and deserves.

In this, both the media and the city government are failing badly, and this is part of why. I asked city councilman and candidate for public advocate Joe Borelli if he thought the city and Mayor Bill de Blasio were doing enough. He was succinct, “It seems like the outrage ended when they couldn’t tie these hate crimes to Trump.”

At a time when we hear anti-Semitic remarks from a U.S. congresswoman and blatant anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan still holds sway among black Americans, we need to focus on and address the roots of anti-Jewish bias and crime in New York City. It can’t be “too hard to talk about.” We have to talk about it, directly and bluntly.

Every week that goes by without doing so, more Jews will be hunted and attacked on the streets of Brooklyn. This is not a complicated and nuanced story, it’s a crisis that nobody seems to want to deal with. That has to change, and it has to change now.

Bill de Blasio Is Lying About Anti-Semitic Attacks In Brooklyn,"At a press conference yesterday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio claimed that anti-Semitism is “a right-wing movement.” Ironically the mayor was speaking in Brooklyn, where attacks against Jews have skyrocketed in recent months. The mayor cannot possibly believe that these attacks are fueled by right-wing rhetoric or Trump supporters.

Hate crimes have risen by 64 percent in New York City and the vast majority of them are anti-Semitic attacks. According to the Anti Defamation League (ADL), such attacks rose in the state of New York by 55 percent in 2018. The city has announced that it will be opening an Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes in coming months, but what good will it be if the mayor refuses to accept the true nature of the problem and continues to pretend that this is all some kind of right-wing plot?

As Joe Borelli, Staten Island’s city councilman, told the New York Post, “A simple look at where anti-Semitic hate crimes have occurred just disproves this– unless you count central Brooklyn as the home of a vast right-wing conspiracy.” He went on to say, “Bill de Blasio regularly says stupid things, but this is literally the stupidest effing thing he’s ever said.”

But it’s far worse than simply being stupid; in fact, it’s incredibly dangerous. As the Orthodox Jewish community is terrorized by violent attacks, the mayor simply refuses to even acknowledge the problem exists. He is giving tacit approval to those who attack Jews by foolishly pretending that anti-Semitism is only to be found among conservatives. How can Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn trust that their mayor is working to solve this problem when he won’t even admit it is a problem?

In fact, the mayor is succumbing to a political correctness that will not allow him to criticize the mostly black and Latino men who are perpetrating these assaults. And let’s be clear: If any other group other than Jews were being targeted for such violence it would be at the top of the mayor’s list of concerns. Instead, he puts his head in the sand and ignores it because he doesn’t like the optics.

At yesterday’s presser, de Blasio said, “I want to be very, very clear, the violent threat, the threat that is ideological is very much from the right.” Not only does this ignore the violent attacks in Brooklyn that only someone living in a fantasy land could believe is the result of Trump or Fox News, but it also ignores the anti-Semitic statements from Democrats like Rep. Ilhan Omar.

Perhaps de Blasio agrees with Omar that Jews are hypnotizing the world with their “Benjamins,” perhaps he believes that Israel should not exist as a Jewish state, perhaps he agrees with the virulent anti-Semitism of left-wing figures like Linda Sarsour. But part of his job is to ensure crime does not go rampant or unpunished. In this capacity, not only is he failing, but he is blatantly lying about who is committing these acts.

This is not a new story in New York City; in 1968 the Jewish Defense League was formed to protect Jews from exactly these kinds of attacks. Vigilantism is not the ideal way for Jews to protect themselves, but when the mayor refuses to act to put a stop to the violence, what other choice is there? Should they just get punched in face and smile knowing that de Blasio says this is just some kind of right-wing problem?

De Blasio is simply and totally negligent on this issue as mayor of New York City. The city needs its mayor to understand, accept, and address this issue with the gravity it requires. This is no time for political correctness to blind him to reality. But yesterday’s remarks make it clear that either de Blasio is as stupid as Borelli claims, or he just doesn’t care.

One thing is certain—the mayor is flat-out wrong about the nature of these attacks, and it is absurd to lay them at the feet of conservatives. Perhaps he is preening for his farcical presidential run, but whatever he is doing, he needs to stop, take stock of the reality on the ground, and work to protect the safety of his citizens—even if they happen to be Orthodox Jews.

What The Men Of D-Day Faced Down To Secure The West's Freedoms,"On November 10, 1942, Winston Churchill remarked that the Allied victory at the Second Battle of El Alamein was “the end of the beginning.” It was a start; the first major win against the European Axis powers in more than a year. Hope was in the air, but further trials remained.

It would be another 574 days until Operation Neptune—the codename for the initial phase of the amphibious Allied invasion of Normandy, France. When it came at last, “D-Day” would seal the fate of Adolf Hitler. For the fascist Nazi tyranny that had held most of Europe hostage for five years, it was now—finally—the beginning of the end.

Churchill and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt long recognized that a breakthrough in the heart of Europe was needed to take the fight to the Nazis. For a time, Churchill favored cleverly sneaking the Allies into Nazi territory “through the back door” of the Balkans and beating the Soviets to Germany. This was later tabled in favor of a daring attack across the English Channel.

Although German leaders expected an attack to come somewhere in the Pas-de-Calais region, the invasion took place 200 miles west of Calais. The Allies successfully deceived the Nazis until the assault was upon them.

The D-Day attack remains the largest seaborne invasion in history. The Normandy landings on June 6, 1944, followed the triumph of the Anzio campaign, which ended with the capture of Rome a day earlier.

Designated as the supreme allied commander in December 1943, Dwight D. Eisenhower’s moving final message to the men of D-Day is often overlooked in the study of American history. On the morning of the attack, Eisenhower addressed the soldiers of the Allied Expeditionary Force:

You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you. In company with our brave Allies and brothers-in-arms on other Fronts, you will bring about the destruction of the German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over the oppressed peoples of Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world. … The tide has turned! The free men of the world are marching together to Victory! I have full confidence in your courage and devotion to duty and skill in battle. … Good luck! And let us beseech the blessing of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking.

More than 6,900 ships and landing craft escorted Allied troops straight into the jaws of death. Strewn across a 50-mile expanse of the Normandy coastline, 156,000 courageous men took the first steps in the liberation of a continent. It was just as Eisenhower had declared earlier that morning—a united force of free men, marching together in the defense of liberty and for the survival of the Western world.

British troops assaulted the beach sectors codenamed Gold and Sword. The Canadian 3rd Infantry streamed onto Juno beach, penetrating farther into France than any other Allied division on D-Day. Representing the United States of America, more than 56,000 servicemen stormed the sandy beachheads of the Utah and Omaha sectors. The Americans on Omaha Beach faced particularly intense resistance and suffered around 2,000 casualties—the largest price to be paid that day.

Along with the men onshore, 15,500 parachuted into northern France with the paratroopers of the U.S. 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions. More than 7,500 additional troops from the British 6th Airborne Division were dropped in behind enemy lines.

Led by Lt. Colonel James Rudder, 190 U.S. Army Rangers of the 2nd Ranger Battalion scaled the treacherously steep promontory cliff of Pointe du Hoc. Plunging their Ranger daggers into the cliff face, they slowly climbed up rope ladders tenuously secured by grappling hooks. The fire raining down on them from Nazi defenses was relentless. But the Rangers made it to the top.

Once there, they took out deadly guns trained on the men embarking on the beaches below and held the vital observatory casemates overlooking Utah and Omaha. After two days of brutal struggle, only 90 rangers could continue fighting.

The most recent and accurate modern study reports that 4,390 Allied men died on D-Day. Although the toll was lower than planners had feared, the number is still shocking. Churchill had remarked to his wife the night before the attack, “Do you realize that by the time you wake up in the morning 20,000 men may have been killed?” Compared to predictions given beforehand, the relatively low casualties incurred during Operation Neptune is a testament to the meticulous planning of Allied command as well as the remarkable fighting prowess of the troops on the ground.

It’s hard to imagine enduring even a few minutes of what the Allied Expeditionary Force experienced on June 6, 1944. Most men who disembarked the landing craft that day were in their early 20s. By all rights, they should have been working at the local hardware store, helping their fathers plant crops, or enjoying the summer break from college classes. Instead, they were 5,000 miles away from home at the most dangerous place on earth.

Every day, we mourn the passing of more these brave men. Now in their mid to late 90s, there will soon come a time when none remain among us. We must never forget their heroic service and sacrifice on that fateful day 75 years ago. We must cherish their memory, thank God for them in our prayers, and make sure that future generations know of their increasingly uncommon valor.

The soldiers of D-Day represent mankind at its most noble, most valiant, and most selfless. They truly were the Greatest Generation. Above all, they were John 15:13 in action: “Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.”

‘Preventative War’ With Iran Would Be Foolhardy And Unpopular At Home,"Given his offers to talk its leaders, President Trump is serious about avoiding a war with Iran—he rightly recognizes it would be bad for America, and his presidency. But the risk of war is higher than ever.

On Thursday, a “sophisticated” attack using torpedo-like weapons hit two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, a body of water next to the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic chokepoint through which much of the world’s oil is shipped. Later that day, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Iran for the attack.

If Iran was indeed behind the attack, it was a brazen act—one of the tankers hit was Japanese-owned, just as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was visiting Iran to attempt to smooth relations between Iran and America (Japan imports a good deal of Iranian oil, and thus has skin in the game).

Tensions Were Already Escalating

Tensions between America and Iran were already running hot. More than a month ago, America sent a carrier group and B-52 bombers to the Middle East to counter a threat from Iran against U.S. troops in the region. That threat, relayed by Israeli intelligence, turned out to be a misunderstanding—Iran thought that America was about to strike, so it readied its military to strike back.

But once Iran had a U.S. carrier group offshore, on May 12, four oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates were hit by mines. Two of those damaged tankers belonged to Iran’s mortal enemy, Saudi Arabia.

U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton blamed those attacks on Iran—and again, while plausible, no evidence has been publicly released to tie Tehran to the attacks. Days later, drone-attacks by Houthi rebels—Iran-backed Shiite Muslims fighting Saudi-led Sunni forces in Yemen’s civil war—attacked two Saudi oil-pumping stations. In response, President Trump—who campaigned on getting out of the Middle East—is sending at least an extra 1,000 troops to the region, in addition to the carrier group.

The backdrop to all this is the White House’s “maximum pressure” campaign of sanctions on Iran—after Trump pulled the U.S. out of the nuclear deal—which includes sanctions on Iranian oil, by far that country’s primary export. Europe has tried to salvage that deal, dubbed the JCPOA, but the far reach of U.S. sanctions has prompted Europe’s companies to pull away from doing business with Iran.

As Iran’s economy has come under immense strain from the sanctions, it has allegedly begun to quadruple its uranium enrichment, ostensibly moving closer to weapons-grade production. This has our European allies, who normally take a conciliatory view toward Iran, concerned about Iran’s adherence to the JCPOA.

Iran is a bad actor, but the problem is that America’s squeezing of Iran, and especially the troop buildup in the region, increases the chances of war with Iran. Ironically, Tehran will probably continue to respond to America’s sanctions and military buildup by upping its nuclear program further, and by orchestrating proxy attacks—the exact opposite of the stated intent of “maximum pressure.”

And there are foreign policy establishment types in the U.S. who are pushing for further escalation, which further risks pulling America into a war.

Don’t Lower the Standard for Starting Wars

Being pushed is an attempt to lower the threshold for war with Iran. Many say that Iran restarting its nuke program in and of itself justifies a military response, with so-called “preventive” military strikes. Rather than defending against an actual or imminent attack, preventive war employs military strikes because a disfavored regime merely possesses a weapons capability. That’s a dangerously low threshold for war.

Normally, threats are defined as “capability” paired with “intent.” Preventive war turns threat analysis on its head and ignores intent. That thinking glosses over America’s immense conventional and nuclear deterrent capabilities—peace through strength—and opts for minimally controlled chaos. Unsurprisingly, wars of this nature hardly turn out well, because war carries far-reaching consequences that are impossible to control or predict, even against a weak opponent—think of the Iraq War.

Nobody wants Iran to have nuclear weapons. But a “preventive” war over Iran’s nuke program would escalate quickly, and U.S. troops would likely need to move in on the ground and attempt regime-change. The result would be a quagmire that lasted decades.

The American public gets this instinctively, and polls show the public overwhelmingly favors defensive (preemptive) actions against Iran, but disfavors nakedly offensive (preventative) actions. Yet officials like National Security Advisor John Bolton are already flirting with a “preventive” war against Iran. Those calls will only grow louder as Iran lashes out against U.S. pressure.

America Risks Provoking Iran Further

The other push by the foreign policy establishment is, whether purposeful or not, almost guaranteeing the escalation of tensions. Whether the intelligence was good or not, the United States now has a carrier group off of Iran’s coast, and is increasing its military capability in the region. Proponents of these measures say it is important to show Iran that we are tough.

But Iran already knows that we are tough, and fears us. That’s why these actions make Iran more likely to restart its nuclear program—Libya’s dead former dictator Muammar Gaddafi gave up his nukes, and look what happened to him. The Iranian program was likely prioritized in the first place after the Bush administration’s regime change campaigns in the Middle East, which happened to encircle Iran on its eastern and western borders (Afghanistan and Iraq, respectively).

Aside from giving Iran more reasons to build nukes, there are other associated risks. Given our troop buildup, there is a very real risk of something akin to the Gulf of Tonkin incident—where American military presence so close to Iran triggers an event, and possibly the loss of American lives, which causes calls for swift military action versus Iran and regime change in Tehran. Then, the United States gets sucked into another war that will further deplete American resources and harm our national security.

By employing “maximum pressure” and a troop buildup in the region—we currently have more than 20,000—we are ultimately giving Iran two choices: they can either capitulate, or they can lash out by pursuing more weapons and by attempting to harm U.S. interests in other ways. How likely is it that Iran, akin to a cornered animal, chooses the former?

Think About the Consequences Here

None of this excuses Iran’s behavior, but Washington should think before it acts. Sending more U.S. troops is a response to Iran’s predictable response to our initial actions. In other words, given our current policy, there are few diplomatic off-ramps for Iran’s leadership, who like all autocrats are desperate not to look weak. We can play hardball, but we should give the Iranians room to save face and come to the table.

The current approach is contrary to Trump’s repeated objective to not start war in the Middle East, and to seek talks with Iran. Instead, Trump is tinkering with the Middle East balance of power, as Obama and Bush did. It endangers his presidency.

Common sense, and the American people, demand that we stick to our historical commitment to deterrence, and peace through strength. Too much of our foreign policy establishment is engineering the conditions that make war more likely. That doesn’t respect our service members, or the will of the American people.

Why Trump’s Cyber Attack On Iran Was The Right Move,"President Trump faced a difficult choice in the wake of Iran’s downing of an American drone over the Strait of Hormuz last week. Eventually, after ordering an attack, Trump decided against it, because the 150 estimated civilian casualties would have represented a disproportionate response to destroying an unmanned drone. But yesterday we found out he did pull the trigger on a different kind of response, and the United States launched a cyber attack against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, disabling some weapon systems.

Although the concept and capability of cyber warfare has existed since at least the 1980s, it is still in a very nascent, although dangerous stage. High-ranking military officials I have spoken to consider the cyber threat to the United States to be the greatest we face from foreign adversaries. Before looking at Trump’s action, and why it was a good move, it’s good to understand the current state of cyber warfare.

There are basically two types of cyber attacks that nations or non-state actors can employ. One is informational; the other degrades actual capabilities of computer networks. For obvious reasons involving Russia’s attempt to influence the 2016 election, the media in the United States has been focused on the informational side. This can include anything from social media election interference, as we saw from the Internet Research Agency, to spying through classified computer systems.

Informational cyber attacks can go on for long periods of time undetected. They are also very cheap to set up and operate. The United States is extremely vulnerable to these kinds of attacks precisely because our society is so free, while our adversaries can simply shut down websites, or the Internet. Thus the United States is struggling, along with social media companies themselves, to combat this growing threat.

The far more serious threat lies in attacks that degrade actual computing and network capabilities. The Pentagon’s top concern in this area is referred to as a cyber Pearl Harbor. This would look something like a foreign power shutting down the electrical grids in major U.S. cities. Such an attack could kill thousands of Americans very quickly. In fact, the military has studied the impact of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico as a model of what might happen if we suffered such an attack.

A cyber Pearl Harbor which leveled that kind of death and destruction would almost certainly be viewed as an outright act of war that must be met with a conventional warfare response. However, smaller-scale degrading cyber attacks, such as the one Trump ordered, exist on a murkier spectrum of destruction and response. It is not clear exactly what level of degradation of computing capabilities would cross the line that calls for a conventional response. This is exactly why it was the right move for Trump.

This is likely not the first time the United States has used a destructive cyber attack against Iran. In 2010 the Stuxnet virus wreaked havoc on the Iranian nuclear program. It is widely believed that this virus was created and employed by the United States and Israel. The difference now is that the United States is actually taking credit for this most recent cyber attack. That is a far bolder move than it appears to be on its face, for a few reasons.

First, unlike informational attacks, destructive cyber attacks are a one-and-done enterprise. This is because once the attack happens, the enemy knows it happened and can quickly reverse-engineer the attack. Not only does this protect the enemy from future attacks involving similar software, it can also improve their cyber capabilities, in a sense that after you shoot them, they get to keep the bullet and try to use it on you.

But perhaps more importantly, by taking credit for the attack, the United States is sending a clear message to Iran that it has a powerful cyber arsenal and is not afraid to use it. In fact, America might be able to inflict a cyber Pearl Harbor on Iran. Without dropping a single bomb, it may be able to unleash enormous death and destruction across wide swaths of Iranian territory. This was a very serious cyber shot across Iran’s bow that still leaves in play the eventual option of conventional attack.

Many observers seem to think that President Trump backed down by not bombing a few military installations in Iran. But this cyber attack is in many ways more insidious and dangerous for the Iranian regime. By signing our name to it, the United States is sending a clear message that it is willing and able to use this newest weapon of war, to dramatic effect.

The future of warfare is now and the Pentagon knows it. How Iran responds will determine if greater cyber attacks might be employed. This was the right attack, it is the right threat to emphasize, and it is the dawn of a new kind of war that will shape the course of international relations.

Accusing Biden Of Racism Betrays The Term’s Flaccidity,"So it turns out that former vice president and current presidential contender Joe Biden is a racist. Or he used to be a racist. Or he isn’t and never was a racist, but the way he speaks about race is racist. Or something.

His offense stems from having worked with segregationist Democrats back in the 1970s, but oddly, it isn’t the working with segregationist Democrats that is the racist part; it is how he described it, including referencing the term “boy.”

These kinds of allegations of racism, led by Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, stemming from what Biden’s detractors might describe as tone deafness is nothing new. These kinds of attacks have been leveled against Republicans for decades now. Usually these Republicans are accused of dog whistling, which is to say, saying something racist that only racists understand as racist, although obviously those calling out the dog whistle hear it, too — generally much more loudly than anyone else.

What is new is for this policing of speech about race to take aim at a major Democratic figure. The motivation here is obvious. Lets be clear, as Biden’s old boss used to say, there would be no accusations of anything had Biden not run for president or if he didn’t lead in the polls. We know this because it was ignored both times he ran for vice president. Certain of his opponents see an opportunity to ding him here, and they are taking it

At the same time, they are being very careful about it. He’s not really being accused of dog whistling, because that requires intent. Nobody, at least thus far, is arguing that Biden is saying intentionally racist things to attract voters.

But in a way this is even worse than how progressive purveyors of critical race theory attack Republicans. The attack on Biden, one that presumably is intended to imply he is not qualified to be president, is based solely on the fact that he is not using the specific modern language that the left demands.

This is a critical and crucial point. The message is that if you don’t speak exactly as progressives demand, you are crossing a line, even if the meaning of what you are saying is something they approve of and agree with. This happened again on Friday when Booker tweeted an attack on Biden for remarks about Treyvon Martin that mentioned his “hoodie,” which became a symbol of the Black Lives Matter movement in the wake of his killing.

This isn’t about a hoodie. It’s about a culture that sees a problem with a kid wearing a hoodie in the first place. Our nominee needs to have the language to talk about race in a far more constructive way. https://t.co/c2BFSSOHro — Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) June 28, 2019

Surely, Booker agrees with what Biden is saying. The problem is how he said it. But this is a game with no rules, a law with no guidelines. Apparently anything that rings a bit tinny to the ear, especially the ear of a person of color, can be outright condemned with no rational explanation other than “I didn’t like the way it sounded.”

A good rule of thumb is that anytime anyone says to you, “I’m not calling you a racist, but…” they are absolutely, 100 percent calling you a racist. For what is a racist, other than someone who is engaging in racism? So if Biden’s phraseology — even without any racist intent, because progressives argue intent is irrelevant — is, shall we say, an embodiment of systemic societal racism, then Biden is engaging in racism and is a racist.

Even the shallowest dive into this scandal shows that it is simply nonsense, and not just nonsense, but nonsense of a kind that can damage reputations based on capricious notions of wrong speak. The deeper dive is worse, because it betrays the fact that progressives have conflated innocent remarks with burning crosses, the result being that burning crosses gains a glimmer of respectability.

We cannot fight the real and powerful forces of racism in this manner anymore than a fire department can fight big, deadly fires if all their energy is spent snuffing out safe fireplaces and charcoal grills.

Politically, it’s not clear what, if any, effect this is all having. Thus far, Biden has survived the slings and arrows slung at him without losing much of his lead, or support. It is possible that attacks on him have stunted his campaign’s growth and staved off the sense of inevitability, but it’s too early to really tell that.

One major risk associated with this kind of attack is that non-progressive white Democrats will see themselves in Biden. If Biden can be accused of racism for such inoffensive speech, then what chance do they have? The white Brooklyn wokester knows she can never be “really” racist because she knows she is racist in the way all white people are. That doesn’t fly over so well in Kansas or Indiana.

Stepping back from politics, to the extent that is even possible is 2019: this is a bad trend for our society. And it carries potentially devastating consequences. One is that good, decent people like Biden get smeared, but arguably worse is that white Americans, and just white Americans, become numb to accusations of racism that have merit and need to be addressed.

Whether or not this hurts Biden, or helps Booker and Harris, it is a bad way to think about race and racism, and promises to do far more harm than good.

"After Andy Ngo Beating, It’s Time For Portland To Shut Antifa Down","WARNING: Graphic pictures and videos of the violent incident are shown below.

“Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster.”—Friedrich Nietzsche

At a protest in Portland, Oregon, on Saturday, members of the anarchist protest group Antifa attacked independent journalist Andy Ngo. Ngo, who is gay and Asian-American, suffered several lacerations on his face and neck, and a bruise under his left eye. His lawyers say he has also suffered a brain bleed as a result of the beatings.

Members of Antifa also threw several milkshakes at Ngo, some of which may have contained quick-dry cement, according to police. This savage attack on a gay, Asian-American journalist shows just how fascist this “anti-racist” mob has become—and what lengths they will go to shut down their political opponents in the name of “anti-fascism.”

What Happened In Portland

Ngo has covered Antifa protests many times. He announced he would be covering this Saturday’s rally in Portland and expressed some anxiety because he thought he might be targeted. Still, Ngo went because he believes it’s important to expose Antifa’s antics, particularly following the violent rally in Charlottesville, Virginia last year, that featured both Antifa and white-supremacists. One of the latter group plowed his car into the crowd, killing one and injuring more than 30.

While there is not video of how the incident began, a local Portland reporter caught most of Ngo’s attack on video. You can clearly see that he is nonviolent and does not respond except by walking away, while the masked Antifa mob kicks, sprays, punches, and throws items at his head.

First skirmish I’ve seen. Didn’t see how this started, but @MrAndyNgo got roughed up. pic.twitter.com/hDkfQchRhG — Jim Ryan (@Jimryan015) June 29, 2019

You can see how Ngo receives several blows to his head and is hit with several “milk shakes” before he attempts to find a safe area to gather himself and rest. Other video shows him talking to the police about the attack and asking for anyone to help recover his GoPro video camera that was recording the protest and which he believes a member of Antifa stole.

Ngo ultimately went to the emergency room, where medical personnel confirmed the extent of his injuries, which include a brain bleed.

Left Blames Ngo, Not the Criminals Who Attacked Him

Ngo, who has written for center-left outlets like Quillette and right outlets such as The New York Post, immediately received intense empathy from many on the right, from our own senior contributor Chad Felix Greene, who began tagging people and spreading the word, to tweets from Ambassador Richard Grenell, an openly gay member of the Trump administration, expressing outrage and sympathy.

However, Ngo’s abhorrent beating has gone largely ignored in the mainstream media, with the exception of a few outlets, including Brian Stelter at CNN, who said that, regardless of ideology, everyone should condemn attacks like this.

Yet some liberals began tweeting that Ngo deserved this outcome since he regularly exposes Antifa’s antics, even though this clip from Ngo shows how, just before he’s beaten, Antifa begins to antagonize him by circling like vultures.

Despite video evidence, liberals began piling on as the evening wore on and Sunday began. Hillary Clinton’s press secretary, who is transgender, tweeted:

https://twitter.com/cmclymer/status/1145218933106126848

Other leftists joined in:

Clarification: Andy Ngo has participated in white supremacist rallies where violence has taken place. I have no idea whether or not he has carried out acts of violence. What's indisputable is the fact he eggs on right wing extremists to carry out violence against Muslims. — CJ Werleman (@cjwerleman) June 30, 2019

https://twitter.com/willcarless/status/1145317792423600128

I don't condone violence and I don't like to see anyone hurt. But Andy Ngo is as much a journalist as I am a second baseman. — Steve Hofstetter (@SteveHofstetter) June 30, 2019

I’d argue what the fear mongering he’s done against Muslims plus the work he’s done to discredit hate crimes, helped create an atmosphere of violence that vulnerable people all have to live through just for being who they are. This is bad, but he’s guilty of worse. — Aymann Ismail (@aymanndotcom) June 30, 2019

Imagine if the shoe were on the other foot: What if a liberal reporter from a left-wing outlet like Huffington Post or BuzzFeed was beaten to a pulp at a pro-life rally? The mainstream and liberal media would explode in condemnation of the attack and pro-lifers, regardless of the context. Even if this person had been heckling the crowd, he would not be blamed for being attacked. On the other hand, Ngo was certainly not acting in a provocative way, as far as videos we have show.

The fact that Ngo lay in a hospital bed while leftists played the victim blame game shows an awful double standard of how the mainstream and liberal media cover stories that involve anyone on the center-right. What do they expect will be the likely response?

It’s Time to Shut Down Antifa

Soon after Antifa beat Ngo, the Portland police tweeted that this was a “civil disturbance and unlawful assembly” and told everyone to vacate the public area under threat of arrest. The mayor of Portland, Ted Wheeler, saw the video of Ngo being beaten and condemned it, but admitted he believed the police acted correctly by not intervening. Portland police have a history of not interfering during Antifa protests.

This is where the police and Portland’s mayor are wrong: Even a cursory glance at Antifa’s origins and stated purpose reveals Antifa never gathers for a peaceful protest and behave more like a domestic terrorist group, spearheaded by angsty, privileged boys. Don’t believe me? The Anti-Defamation League, no bunch of conservatives, has said Antifa “proactively seek physical confrontations with their perceived fascist adversaries.”

In 2017, a CNN article quoted Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, who said Antifa activists get violent because “they believe that elites are controlling the government and the media. So they need to make a statement head-on against the people who they regard as racist.”

In the same article, Antifa organizer Scott Crow told CNN “The idea in Antifa is that we go where they [right-wingers] go. That hate speech is not free speech. That if you are endangering people with what you say and the actions that are behind them, then you do not have the right to do that. And so we go to cause conflict, to shut them down where they are, because we don’t believe that Nazis or fascists of any stripe should have a mouthpiece.”

Not only does Ngo utterly fail to support fascism, Antifa has behaved this way at so many protests it’s obvious they are actually more fascist than otherwise. In fact, they seem to condemn conservatives far more than they do fascists. They clearly do not understand what true fascism entails and the destructive role that ideology has played in nations in the recent past, starting with street riots and lawless violence like this.

Either way, ignorance of history is no excuse for Antifa to descend upon a city like Portland, even with its ignorant, wussy mayor at the helm, and wreak violent havoc, specifically targeting a gay, Asian-American journalist who values free speech.

It’s time for Portland’s Wheeler to put an end to this group of entitled, violent thugs, who wouldn’t know real fascism if it hit them in the face with a quick-concrete-filled “milkshake.” They have proven themselves to be violent without cause, willing to target even moderate journalists, and in a free society that should only get them a ticket to jail.

I Was With Andy Ngo During The Antifa Attack. Here Are Pictures,"Warning: At the bottom of this article, beneath a subheading noting what follows, are grisly photographs of injuries.

I have known Andy Ngo for several months. I am not sure how we met, but I may have written him on Twitter and he wrote me back. That is to the best of my memory.

We both live or have lived in Portland and both of us have had experience with Antifa. I suppose we connected over that. We have gone to a few things together and spent enough time in the car to have those conversations you wouldn’t normally have just hanging out. While I don’t know Andy very well, I feel like I know him enough to speak about his character and professionalism.

I respect him. His intellect and curiosity about people. He has such a lovely way of asking questions and getting people to talk in conversation. His mind is quick, he is funny and sweet. He also takes his work seriously and strives to be fair in his coverage. I think he is what a journalist should be.

Andy and I planned to go together to this rally and counter protest set for June 29th. He expressed concern about Antifa targeting him, and asked if I would be there to be a witness and document what happened. We met up on the edge of the park, where Antifa had planned their counter protest.

While walking into Lonsdale Square, I could see people handing out free milkshakes, complete with the Antifa symbol on the cups.

The people serving the milkshakes were also making them in the square. I am skeptical of the story going around that said they were adding quick-setting concrete mix to the milkshakes. It is possible someone was picking up a single shake, walking off with it, then adding cement mix, but there have been no official confirmations of this. Several people were drinking their shakes.

As Andy was walking around Lonsdale Square, he was recording with his GoPro video camera and narrating the scene. Frequently Black Bloc, the more militant wing of Antifa, would come up to physically block him from filming by surrounding him very closely. People also taunted him and us and waved signs in his face.

This guy above walked up to Andy from behind, not realizing I was watching him and taking pictures of the scene. I saw him reach into his fanny pack as he got close to Andy. Then I said, “Hey, what are you doing?”

He immediately swerved away and took off at a jog. I gave chase to try and get a better picture, but was blocked by people to keep me from doing so. I don’t know what he was going to take out of his fanny pack, but it wasn’t a milkshake.

The picture above is a perfect example, if fairly tame, of how Antifa would block and crowd Andy while he was filming and reporting. He was not loud or obtrusive at all. They were determined to block and harass him at every turn.

For some reason they don’t bother Katie Shepherd of the Willamette Week or Jason Wilson of The Guardian. Both have given Antifa very favorable coverage compared to their coverage of the opposing groups of Patriot Prayer, Proud Boys, and Haley Adams.

The above is the typical proximity of the Antifa crowding. I am not easily intimidated in these settings, and neither is Andy, but it is unnerving to have people so close to you covered head to toe in black and knowing it isn’t possible to identify them if they do commit a crime.

Sometimes they are silent, and other times they are aggressive or mocking, whatever seems to rattle you the most. Not reacting is the best defense. Shortly after this picture was taken, Andy was assaulted for the first time.

A tall man wearing medic clothing and a medic backpack walked up in between us and threw a milkshake on Andy. He turned and calmly walked away. I gave chase, and when he saw I was coming after him with my camera, he ran. I was then blocked repeatedly byAantifa as I was trying to get a good shot of the attacker.

It is scary because it is unexpected, people cheer and laugh, and no one knows what is in the liquid thrown on them. Andy had to walk out of the park to clean up and so he could make a police report.

I asked the police to arrest the person, as I could identify him if they came with me at the time. They said they could not safely go in to the park but would take copies of my photos for the report. Later, I saw a video of the same man hitting a bystander in the back of the head with a bike lock, resulting in a serious injury.

As Andy was making the report, this man above walked up and offered cookies he had baked. He said he thought these protests needed more love and sweetness. He seemed sincere and insisted I take a cookie. He ate one, so I did, too. It was good. Surreal experience. I saw the man later as he was walking with Antifa still handing out cookies. A very Portlandia scene.

This woman above mocked Andy as he walked by, asking how he enjoyed his milkshake.

Above shows the immediate aftermath of the second milkshaking (assault). It’s Andy and the person who assaulted him. I gave chase as well to get another photograph and let the police know it had happened again. They gave the same response as above. Andy made a second report and went back in. I followed.

This time the milkshake had gotten in his eye and we became concerned about what was really in those. He cleaned up, though, and went back in. He was definitely rattled, as I was. Anytime someone is walks up and throws something at you in that hyper-agressive kind of setting, it is unnerving.

The above shows some of Antifa’s rhetoric: “You will be replaced.” The “okay” sign is to them synonymous with Proud Boys and some Trump supporters.

Antifa were gathering to march out of the park and onto the streets of downtown Portland. It was an unpermitted march that closed down several streets on a very busy Saturday.

Here they are marching, a sea of black. They are covered head to toe, so it’s nearly impossible to identify anyone who commits a crime. They took over the street, only receiving pushback from the police when they neared the waterfront, a popular tourist and weekend destination.

They were chanting “ACAB, all cops are bastards.” There were also chants about Proud Boys and about Ngo. The organized groups in attendance that I noticed included: Black Bloc, Democratic Socialists of America (the DSA), and Skinheads, both RASH and SHARPs.

The banner Antifa carried in front of their march had a message for a group known as Proud Boys. This counter protest was planned in opposition to a Proud Boy event that took place on the same day in downtown Portland. The two groups had no interaction that day, unlike previous events where there were massive brawls.

The police were allowed to create a barricade to turn them around at this point. Antifa just turned around and marched a different direction. This is one way the police are able to enforce some rule of law.

This is the last picture I got of Andy. Shortly after this, I was surrounded and mobbed by a group of Black Bloc, who were screaming at me, calling me a fascist, and telling me I had to leave, all while encircling me.

Often at these events the attack comes from the side or back, so I tensed up, waiting for a blow or pepper spray. None came, however, and the crowd thinned. And Andy was gone. The next time I talked to him was after he was viciously assaulted and on the way to the hospital.

Graphic Pictures of Another Brutal Antifa Attack

Shortly after Andy was attacked, a man named Adam Kelly, who had come to downtown to another event, was beaten by at least three assailants. One had a bike lock and strongly resembled the person who threw a milkshake on Ngo earlier in the day.

When Adam went to help another man who had been attacked and was on the ground, he was viciously attacked from behind. These three pictures below are not mine. He took the time to talk to me last night in spite of a vicious headache from the concussion he got, which took 25 staples to close. Photo credit: Adam Brody.

It is difficult to end on this note. Two severely injured men, who had done nothing to deserve what happened to them, and no justice in sight.

The attackers were masked and may not be brought to justice. One man was there to cover the events of the day as a journalist, the other was there to attend a rally, and both were there to express their First Amendment rights. The Portland mayor, Ted Wheeler, seems powerless to stop the violence, or lacks the will to stop it.

I returned home safely, fortunately. My coverage of these events started more than two years ago, and has encompassed three states and several cities. I’m left wondering What happens next time? Who is coming home with his head split open? Or worse, who isn’t coming home at all?",https://thefederalist.com/2019/07/02/andy-ngo-antifa-attack-happened-pictures/,2019-07-02
The First Amendment Shouldn’t Be An Empty Promise To American Jews,"The First Amendment’s promise of freedom of religion is an empty one if all Americans, including American Jews, don’t feel safe in their houses of worship or welcome in their communities. With FBI data showing that 58 percent of religiously-motivated hate crimes targeted American Jews in 2017, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has been making an increased effort to support and engage with the Jewish community, including by convening a summit on domestic anti-Semitism this week.

The day-long event included speakers from the Departments of Justice, State, Treasury, and Education, including the secretaries of Treasury and Education. Panels addressed how to combat anti-Semitism while respecting the First Amendment, anti-Semitism on college campuses, the prosecution of hate crimes, and federal efforts to combat anti-Semitism.

In his introductory remarks, Attorney General William Barr compared various forms of anti-Semitism to different forms of cancer, observing that the body politic needs a strong immune system that rejects both anti-Semitism and racial hatred. Speakers throughout the day acknowledged the patient is sick. However, Barr told American Jews that he sees rising anti-Semitism, not only in the widely discussed attacks in Pittsburgh and Poway, but also on the streets of Crown Heights, in desecrated cemeteries, and in zoning decisions intended to exclude growing Jewish communities.

Barr told the audience, those experiences “form the daily background of concerns about safety and security that many Jews feel. I want to assure you that the Department of Justice and [the] whole federal government stands with you and will not tolerate these attacks.”

Much-needed Solidarity

That solidarity is appreciated during a week that’s seen the introduction of Congress’ first-ever resolution in support of boycotting Israel. The boycott movement arose repeatedly as one powerful example of excluding and marginalizing Jews—92 percent of American Jews support Israel—as speakers addressed how contemporary anti-Semitism manifests on college campuses, as well as in our cities and towns.

During a panel about anti-Semitism and free speech, Jason Isaacson, chief policy and political affairs officer for the American Jewish Committee, said that this “discussion shouldn’t be framed as choosing between protecting Jews and the First Amendment. The best antidote to bad speech is good speech.” He also urged Americans to criticize their own political allies and insist that anti-Semitism is unacceptable, calling this “a battle for ideas” and a “fight for the soul of our nation.”

This conversation also considered whether boycotts qualify as free speech. Eugene Kontorovich, a professor at Antonin Scalia Law School commented, “Too often, those who wish to discriminate on the basis of Israeli nationality try to take for themselves the language of human rights and say they’re not discriminating, they’re boycotting.” However, “Germany, Canada, and courts in France and Spain have concluded that treating Israelis as a fixed class and refusing to do business with them is discrimination.”

As for life on campus, the boycott movement has become central. William Jacobson, a professor at Cornell Law School, dated that change to 2012-13.

Jonathan Tobin, editor in chief of the Jewish News Syndicate, observed that “progressive spaces have become ground zero for anti-Semitism. The growing popularity of anti-Zionism has created a hostile atmosphere on campuses, where Jews feel marginalized and threatened.” That marginalization is led by professors, especially those who teach Middle Eastern studies. On campuses today, traditional, negative Jewish stereotypes are being projected onto Israel.

Jacobson described Jewish students’ feeling “ganged up on,” as well as intersectionality’s transformation from a precise word to a broad buzzword “provid[ing] the intellectual framework for people who wouldn’t consider themselves anti-Semitic to isolate Jewish students. It’s a toxic mixture of racial and identity politics where anti-Semitism is the unifying feature for groups with little in common.”

Alyza Lewin, President of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, described “a well funded strategy to deny Zionists a place in society” and asked, “if you isolate and dehumanize Zionists and claim they represent society’s greatest evil, you’re branding Jews with a virtual Jewish star, and then what comes next?

As for what can be done, Lewin wants administrators to condemn anti-Semitic speech and actions just as they would if something racist happens. Lewin also suggests helping administrators to identify what is anti-Semitic. Jacobson recommends equal treatment and enforcement of a campus’ existing rules, rather than having administrators regulate speech. Tobin suggests that adults model speaking up so that Jewish students feel courageous enough to do the same.

Federal Agencies Doing Their Part

While Congress and state legislatures have been taking steps to oppose the boycott movement, federal agencies are clearly also making an effort to push back against various forms of anti-Semitism with the tools at their disposal. Calvin Shivers, deputy assistant director in the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division, described hate crimes as his division’s top priority, based on the impact these crimes have on the community. The Civil Rights Division is aggressively pursuing cases against individuals involved in attacks on houses of worship, as well as attacks that threaten or harm individual Jews. The Department of Justice is also keeping an eye out for discrimination against houses of worship in zoning and landmarking.

Special Envoy for Monitoring and Combating Anti-Semitism Elan Carr described this as “the time to save our future from what’s on the horizon,” noting that one of the great assets in this fight is that every federal player that can apply pressure to this problem is doing so. In fact, there was a White House meeting last week to discuss making this an administration-wide effort and a determination “not to contain this scourge, but to roll it back, to excise it.”

Carr said the administration will apply every legal force it can and will fight this fight because what’s at stake is the future of our country, and our kids deserve a better future. And to that, I say, Amen.

"No, Anti-Terrorism Hasn’t Hurt Investigations Of White Supremacists","AUSTIN, Texas — Earlier this summer, I testified before a U.S. House subcommittee on “FBI efforts to combat an increasing threat of white supremacy and white extremism.” My expertise is that of a former counterterrorism intelligence manager for the Texas Department of Public Safety, where for nearly a decade (2009-2018) my team of analysts worked on domestic and international terrorism matters with the FBI as part of one of the nation’s largest multi-agency fusion centers.

The House Democrats of the Oversight and Reform Committee came to the hearing with a narrative: that white nationalist President Donald Trump had suppressed national investigative efforts that would hurt his friends and supporters in the white supremacy movement.

I testified to a contrary experience in Texas coordinating intelligence with our state criminal investigative agents, who were assigned to all five of the state’s FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces, usually to domestic terrorism squads working on problems that included violent white supremacy, black identity nationalism, and the anarchist Antifa movement.

“Neither we nor the FBI ever dismissed the domestic extremist threat or violent white supremacists, as some suggest, but faced them at every turn during my service,” I testified, in part. “I personally saw to it that some of my analysts were always dedicated to this threat problem. What I can tell you from my experience is that our collaborative arrangements remained in place after the 2016 election. At the line level, we created intelligence, passed information to the FBI on the e-Guardian system or in person, and filled their requests for their case needs. Good things happened as a result.”

I stand by that. In the aftermath of this past weekend’s mass shootings, another form of the narrative is finding purchase: that strong post-9/11 efforts to counter Islamist terrorism are politically and racially inequitable compared to the weak, suppressed efforts to counter violent white nationalism.

As the editorial board of The New York Times put it Sunday, “There are serious questions about how the United States has approached Islamic extremism, but if even a degree of that vigilance and unity of effort was put toward white nationalism, we’d be safer.”

Assessments like this belie a surprising ignorance of the fact that homeland security legislation, appropriations, and response were structured after 9/11 to address problem sets that are so mutually exclusive that they have and always will require separate approaches. This is the very definition of a false comparison that should stand corrected as the nation lurches forward in any public discussion. It cannot be farther from true that violent Islam received a disproportionate attention at the high cost of allowing domestic forms of violent extremism to flourish.

Take the Islamist threat. Because violent political Islamism emanates from a global, internationalist set of actors and ideologies, often in foreign locales, a multi-piece toolkit was required to help the FBI counter it as the designated lead agency. Unlike forms of domestic extremism, working to disrupt Islamist terrorism requires both a deep home and away game. The FBI cannot do it without CIA spies, National Security Agency signals intelligence operations, troop deployments, armed drones, and global tracking of human suspects and money.

Consider what it might take to counter al-Qaeda plans to send operatives from Afghan training camps to hijack planes in America, or to disrupt ISIS operatives moving across multiple borders on mass-casualty attack missions in Europe, or to counter the highly effective online recruitment of Americans who travel abroad and join foreign groups of killers in foreign countries with plans to return home, perhaps indoctrinated to commit acts of terror. Legislation and vast inter-agency intelligence-sharing reforms after 9/11 were necessary to marry this very unique American response to an equally unique threat.

By contrast, violent white supremacy of the sort we saw on tragic display in El Paso is largely a law enforcement problem confined to within the United States and its territories, with far less of a global dimension. While a shooter may take “inspiration” from manifestos and chatter posted online or acts seen on the news, like the mosque massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand, these kinds of crimes and plots tend to be entirely local self-propelled affairs conducted by lone offenders.

Much has been said, for instance, about the online format “8chan” as a platform for spreading incitements to violence among white racist extremists (the site has been closed since El Paso). But law enforcement agencies already have the means to watch sites like this, and other sites that traffic in narcotics and stolen property, for that tricky moment when free speech becomes illegal incitement or provides probable cause indicators.

Lone offender racists in the United States are not deployed from places abroad that must be controlled and monitored as with international jihadist terrorism. For that reason, domestic terrorism plots require an almost exclusively domestic law enforcement response by the FBI, local sheriff’s offices, and state police agencies like the one I used to work for in Texas.

CIA officers and military forces are not even statutorily allowed to operate in a law enforcement capacity within U.S. territory, nor can the NSA, spy satellites, or armed drones be enjoined in domestic enforcement action next to your local sheriff’s deputy. The USA Patriot Act did formalize a domestic terrorism definition (another of many) and allow for the FBI and DHS to identify potentially violent domestic groups and movements as intelligence and enforcement priorities, at least internally. Domestic extremists to include violent white nationalists can be placed on terror watch lists as a means to occasionally track their movements and activities.

But not much new legislation, such as a standalone Domestic Terrorism Statute, was ever necessary to mount a counterattack on violent white nationalism, since all of the necessary component parts—cops, prosecutors, and criminal statutes that carry high punishments, such as for murder and hate crimes—have long been in place.

Critics of President Trump may feel a strong compulsion to argue that his excess hatred of Islam and affection for white supremacy drove policy toward a break for the white nationalists. But their thinking is flawed by gaps in basic knowledge of how homeland security is structured to deal with both problems in the unique ways that are necessary.

This is not to say that American law enforcement can’t pivot to meet a growing threat with greater resources and attention. As I testified to Congress in June, “The number of racially motivated criminal events is now higher than what we were used to. A pivot is necessary to reverse the trend.”

However, inequality of effort certainly did not contribute to El Paso. Self-propelled lone offenders who use simple tactics in their attacks are notoriously difficult for law enforcement to detect, or to detect in time to lawfully intervene.

The threat from violent Islamism remains in play, despite other faulty comparisons that are often made to fraudulently downplay it, such as the current favorite of comparing the death toll from Islamist-motivated attacks to those caused by domestic supremacists. Properly diagnosing threats requires not death tolls but reporting the total numbers of thwarted attacks that might have resulted in deaths. And the FBI has tallied hundreds of prosecutions related to the Islamist terror threat.

To divert from efforts to disrupt Islamist attacks by the hundreds no doubt will result in lost lives one day, as it did before 9/11. In any case, whether to prioritize violent Islamism or white nationalism is not an either-or proposition. This is a resourced country that certainly can and should do both jobs separately and well.

‘The Squad’ Co-Sponsors Bill Claiming Israel Tortures Children,"Many Americans now know that Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar—two members of “the squad” of far-left congresswomen so much in the news—were recently barred from traveling to Israel to agitate for the anti-Israel boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement. Fewer know all four members of “the squad,” including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, have co-sponsored a bill that accuses the Jewish state of torturing children. Fewer still know the claims made in the bill originate mostly from a group that could be described as the propaganda arm of a terrorist organization.

The so-called “Promoting Human Rights for Palestinian Children Living Under Israeli Military Occupation Act“ was re-introduced in the House by Rep. Betty McCollum, whose congressional district neighbors Omar’s in Minnesota. Until recently, McCollum was considered a supporter of Israel, but a critic of its government.

In February, however, she condemned “[t]he right-wing, extremist government of Benjamin Netanyahu and its apartheid-like policies,” adding “there are now members of Congress who are not willing to ignore the Israeli government’s destructive actions because they are afraid of losing an election.”

McCollum’s invective prompted Mark Mellman of the Democratic Majority for Israel to respond that Netanyahu “came to office in a fair and democratic election in which every Arab citizen of Israel had the same right to vote as any Jewish citizen.” Mellman added that “by suggesting that Jews have disproportionate influence on U.S. elections, the Congresswoman exploits an anti-Semitic trope widely used by far right forces from Czarism to fascism.”

McCollum’s bill, while not directly exploiting the anti-Semitic trope of blood libel, trades on the accusation that Israel treats non-Jewish children cruelly and inhumanely. The bill claims Palestinian children detained by Israeli defense forces suffer torture and physical violence, are deprived of lawyers and parents, not informed of their legal rights, and so on.

It ultimately aims to prohibit “U.S. assistance to Israel from being used to support the military detention, interrogation, or ill-treatment of Palestinian children in violation of international humanitarian law.” As federal law already bars U.S. aid to foreign security forces who commit gross human rights violations, the bill is an exercise in singling out the Jewish state.

The accusations presented as “findings” in the bill are cribbed—occasionally verbatim—from inaccurate claims made by several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that lead BDS campaigns in the United States and abroad. The bill’s claims largely come from Defense for Children International-Palestine (DCI-P). Historically, DCI-P officials, employees, and board members have had links to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), which is considered to be a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union, and Canada.

The PFLP has a long record of terror attacks, dating back to the Lod Airport massacre, which killed 28 people in 1968. The PFLP may be best known for the 1976 hijacking of an Air France plane, which was ended by the Israeli raid on Entebbe Airport. In 1980, PFLP attacked a kibbutz, seizing a nursery and murdering a two-year-old. Since 2000, PFLP has executed more than a dozen suicide bombings, shootings, stabbings and even ax attacks, notably in the 2014 Jerusalem synagogue massacre that killed four and injured seven.

Shawan Jabarin, a member of DCI-P’s board from 2007-14, was convicted in 1985 for recruiting and arranging training for members for the PFLP. Mahmoud Jiddah, a DCI-P board member from 2012-16, was imprisoned for 17 years after launching grenade attacks against Israeli civilians in 1968; he is also alleged to be a member of PFLP. Mary Rock, elected to the board in 2014, was a PFLP candidate for the Palestinian Legislative Council in 2006.

Nasser Ibrahim, a president of DCI-P’s General Assembly, was the former editor of the PFLP’s weekly news publication. Riyad Arar, a director of DCI-P’s Child Protection Program, addressed a December 2014 PFLP memorial event for a group member who was killed “while engaging in a demonstration confronting the occupation forces with stones and Molotov cocktails.” And this is far from a complete list of ties between DCI-P personnel and PFLP—ties that caused Citibank and Arab Bank PLC to stop accepting funds for donation to DCI-P.

NGO Monitor has published a point-by-point rebuttal to the claims made by DCI-P and other groups that are incorporated into McCollum’s bill. For example, the bill relies on claims of physical violence against minors collected by DCI-P, when “very few actual complaints are either submitted to the appropriate Israeli civilian or military authorities or raised in court, and even fewer are found to be justified. In practice, the claims are made based on anonymous complainants ‘interviewed’ by DCI-P staffers.” McCollum’s bill also attempts to pass off accusations made by DCI-P as findings of the U.S. State Department.

Missing from the bill, and the DCI-P propaganda on which it is based, is the history of Palestinian terror groups using children to carry out suicide bombings and stabbings, or paying teenagers to die in border riots. The omission is glaring in light of a DCI-P program director admitting on television that Palestinian minors commit terror attacks to enhance their societal status.

If the real concern were how Palestinian children are treated, DCI-P would not blame Israel for Hamas training Palestinan youth to kidnap soldiers, use weapons, and infiltrate Israel though tunnels. And members of Congress would not express concern for Palestinian children only as a cudgel against the Jewish state.

The discriminatory smears would be bad enough, but there’s more. McCollum’s bill also seeks to appropriate $19 million every year for “nongovernmental organizations from the United States, Israel, or the Occupied Palestinian Territory” to “monitor” these alleged abuses.

No wonder anti-Israel NGOs like DCI-P, the American Friends Service Committee, Jewish Voice for Peace, Center for Constitutional Rights, and the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights (the American umbrella group of the BDS movement) have endorsed the bill. It is almost as if they wrote it.

The good news is that the bill has been referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, where it will likely die over the objections of committee member Omar. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a co-chair of the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee and close ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, has withdrawn her co-sponsorship of the bill, which she claims was given by mistake.

DeLauro told The Intercept she opposes the bill because it “seeks to single out Israel for criticism, and seeks to appropriate money to investigate, document, and report only on Israeli abuses.” That McCollum’s bill retains the co-sponsorship of “the squad” is a reminder that the Corbynization of the Democratic Party continues, even after Congress overwhelmingly condemned the BDS movement.

Rashida Tlaib Blames Israel For Terrorist Attack That Killed Israeli Teen,"On Saturday evening, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., tweeted her sadness about the terrorist bombing that took the life of 17-year-old Israeli Rina Shnerb. Shnerb was hiking with her brother and father at the Ein Bubin Spring in the West Bank on August 23 when a bomb was “triggered remotely when [Rina’s] family approached it.” Rina’s brother and father were injured in the attack.

Palestinian-American Tlaib’s tweet took a rapid shift from emotional outpouring to launching guilt at Israel: “More than ever,” she wrote, “we need to support nonviolent approaches to ending the Israeli occupation and guaranteeing equal rights for all. Extremism that puts innocent lives at risk moves us no closer to peace.”

As did the organization whose statement she retweeted, Tlaib implied that policies of the Jewish state of Israel were somehow to blame for the heinous actions of terrorists who detonated a bomb. It was hardly a surprising turn of events for the freshman representative, who often uses her public bullhorn to spread anti-Israel propaganda and bad Holocaust history.

Terrorist organization Hamas called the bombing “proof of the vitality and bravery of the Palestinian people.” According to the Israel Defense Forces, Palestinians celebrated Rina’s death by passing out candies.

August Has Been a Deadly Month

Perhaps Tlaib is not aware that Shnerb’s murder was only the most recent attack against Israelis in what has been a deadly month for America’s ally. Israel and its policies are no more to blame for the death of Shnerb than they are for this month’s series of cowardly attacks.

On August 7, 18-year-old yeshiva student Dvir Sorek was stabbed to death by two Palestinian men in the Etzion settlement in the West Bank. According to the Israeli army, the two men may have attempted to kidnap Sorek, and killed him in their vehicle before throwing him onto the street. When Sorek’s body was discovered, he was still clutching the books he had just purchased in Jerusalem. They were meant to be gifts for his teachers.

After Sorek’s death, the Palestinian Authority (PA) passed out candy in celebration, while leaders called Sorek’s murder “‘a heroic operation’ and ‘a natural response to the Israeli occupation’s crimes.’” Visible during Sorek’s solemn funeral service was a display of fireworks from Palestinians celebrating Sorek’s death in a nearby village.

On August 11, Tisha B’Av, a Jewish fast day, coincided with Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha, leading to a confrontation at the al-Aqsa Mosque, also known as the Temple Mount, in Jerusalem’s Old City. After an Eid al-Adha prayer, thousands of Muslims moved toward the Mughrabi Gate, the only gate non-Muslims may use to approach the Temple Mount, and began “throwing rocks and other objects at police.”

Israeli police used “dispersal means,” including tear gas, to respond to the riot, injuring 61 Muslims involved. Four members of the Israeli police were also wounded during the event. Contrary to fact, the spokesman of the PA President Mahmoud Abbas claimed that Israeli police had “storm[ed] the al-Aqsa Mosque and act[ed] aggressively against worshippers.”

On August 15, video captured a horrific terror attack near the Shalshelet Gate in the Old City, in which two Palestinian teens ran towards an Israeli police officer and began to stab him. Other officers at the scene fired on the teens, killing one. The second attacker was sent to the hospital, as was the officer, who had sustained a chest wound.

On August 16, near the Elazar settlement in the West Bank, a Palestinian Fatah member who had previously been jailed for acts of terror rammed a stolen car into two Israeli siblings. The 17-year-old brother, who suffered a fractured skull, underwent neurosurgery, and was sedated and on a respirator the day after the attack. His 19-year-old sister experienced injuries to her limbs.

Blame the Palestinian Authority’s ‘Pay for Slay’

If Tlaib is concerned about the impetus of the act of terror that killed Shnerb, she should look first to the PA, which offers incredible monetary incentives to Palestinians who launch such despicable terrorist attacks on Israelis.

In a policy known as “pay for slay,” the PA motivates attacks against Israeli “occupiers” by paying the perpetrators and their families a monthly stipend. “The more egregious the crime,” according to an op-ed from The Hill, “the more you get paid. Campsites, schools, clinics are named after so-called martyrs who kill innocent Jews.”

Every year, the PA pays out more than $330 million, or 7 percent of its budget, to those who attack Israelis. These funds, as explained in a January 2019 Washington Examiner op-ed, are distributed to “approximately 10,500 imprisoned and released prisoners and some 37,500 families of martyrs and injured.” In comparison, the PA’s welfare budget of $214 million is distributed between “118,000 households: a much larger group subsisting on a much smaller budget.”

In his description of the motivators for “pay for slay,” Army Lt. Col. Charles Faint mentions the 2004 law providing these payments. According to this law, the funds are provided for those “participating in the struggle against the occupation,” as they are “an integral part of the fabric of the Arab-Palestinian society.” Faint notes that “struggles” can involve anything “from throwing rocks to murdering American tourists.”

Here Faint refers to American Taylor Force, a Vanderbilt University student and former Army officer who was stabbed to death in Jaffa in 2016 while visiting Israel with his fellow graduate students. A West Bank political group referred to Force’s killer as “a ‘heroic martyr,’ and instituted payments to his family.”

Prior to 2018, Faint states the United States distributed around $300 million to the PA each year. With the passage of the Taylor Force Act in March 2018, all U.S. aid to the PA, except for some humanitarian funds, will cease until “pay for slay” is discontinued. Other countries, such as Australia and Israel, have followed suit.

Even as donor countries considered pulling funds from the PA, however, Abbas defended “pay for slay,” saying the program fulfilled “a social responsibility to look after innocent people affected by the incarceration or killing of their loved ones.”

Other Lies Tlaib Spreads about Israel

On Saturday, Tlaib called for a state that would guarantee “equal rights for all.” The 120-member body of the Knesset, Israel’s House of Representatives, includes 5 LGBTQ members, 12 non-Jews, and 29 women.

In comparison, earlier this month, the PA “banned LGBTQ organizations from operating in the West Bank,” stating LGBTQ events “go against and infringe upon the higher principles and values of Palestinian society.” While a Palestinian news agency claimed in 2018 that a single member of the Palestinian National Council, Uri Davis, is Jewish, Davis converted back to Islam in 2008.

Once considered fringe and hateful beliefs, Tlaib’s statements now get unprecedented air time and are becoming normalized.

Tlaib regularly makes false and dangerous allegations about Israel, like remarking on the country’s alleged “racism and…international human rights violations,” likening Israel to “the apartheid in South Africa,” and conflating Palestinians’ fight against Israel with the American fight for civil rights.

Once considered fringe and hateful beliefs, Tlaib’s statements now get unprecedented air time and are becoming normalized. Countering such drivel with facts seems to be a full-time occupation. Luckily, groups like the Anti-Defamation League methodically and factually counter these types of flawed allegations so Americans can readily educate themselves about the types and varieties of antisemitic attacks launched at our ally with increasing force and regularity.

While Tlaib’s sorrow about Shnerb’s death appears real, the representative must recognize how the falsehoods she spreads help to delegitimize, demonize, and disenfranchise the Jewish state of Israel. The words she uses to blame Israel for the actions of terrorists are not unlike the words of those who claim Israel is the aggressor while paying terrorists handsomely to conduct attacks against innocent Israelis.

If our congresswoman continues to offer a shallow, one-sided truths about the Israel-Palestine conflict and fails to address the PA’s “pay to slay” laws, or the cult of “heroic martyrdom” granted to those who kill Israelis, then it is the duty of every American who supports Israel to learn the truth and speak up loudly against Tlaib’s emotionally charged lies.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/08/27/rashida-tlaib-blames-israel-terrorist-attack-killed-israeli-teen/,2019-08-27
Why Criminals Looking To Victimize Women Love Gun Control,"On September 3, Lachelle Hudgins wounded a robber who had attempted to steal her purse. While the mainstream media pan the attack as an overreaction to an attempted purse-snatching, Hudgins, who was there, saw it differently.

According to the video recorded by a local ABC reporter, five attackers approached her car in the wee hours of the morning. How was she to know the attack would end with only a stolen purse? “With so many men surrounding her car and trying to get in the car, she did the only thing she could think to do. She reached in her purse for her gun.” Hudgins said of the incident, “I saved my life.”

In all the current hysteria to “buy back” (translation: “confiscate”) guns, we should not overlook this question: Should women be permitted to protect their own bodies? Or should they be forced to passively endure an attack until an authorized protector from the government can ride to their rescue?

I can reasonably assume Ronnie Preyer’s opinion: He’s against women being armed. Or he would be if this serial rapist wasn’t shot to death by a Cape Girardeau woman fighting to protect her body from his attack. After Preyer raped her the first time, she dutifully called the police. A few days later, he returned to attack her a second time. This time, instead of a phone, she used a gun to protect herself.

Ricky Wright would likely join calls for sensible gun control after being shot in the face by Michelle Booker when he attempted to steal her car and drive off with her children inside. Justin Martin, were he alive, would also likely join the chorus for gun control, after being shot trying to invade the home of an 18-year-old woman with her new baby. Go mama bear! A 70-year-old grandmother in Philadelphia created yet another gun-control advocate when she wounded a 43-year-old home invader trying to, well, thank heavens we don’t know what.

Often overlooked in the gun control issue is that laws intended to disarm male attackers also reduce the choices women have for self-protection. It might make sense for some gun control advocates to carry pepper spray or remain in the company of a protective male. But for some women who wish to live independently, the option of a firearm offsets the overwhelming physical superiority of a potential attacker. It’s her body. Shouldn’t she have the right to choose how best to protect it?

“No!” says the National Women’s Law Center. The solution may be found in “robust public policies” to keep guns out of the hands of people who have demonstrated their capacity to harm others.” Yet Preyer’s victim did exactly that, reporting his violent rape of her days before he returned to do it again. Unfortunately, “robust public policies” keep guns out of the hands of victims, leaving them to attempt fending off attackers with nothing but a cell phone and soaring social justice rhetoric.

Ah, but what about “common sense” gun restrictions? Consider Vermont’s well-intentioned laws that will actually make women more defenseless in the face of their attackers. Among other things, it bans women under the age of 21 from purchasing a firearm to keep in their purses. That should make good common sense to predators who prefer victims under the age of 21.

California, Connecticut, Washington D.C., Hawaii, parts of Chicago, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New York have all restricted the magazines women can use in their handguns to 10 or fewer rounds. Why would anyone need more than 10 rounds to defend themselves? Because, as a study shows, when a trained police officer fires at a suspect at close range, he has a 15 percent chance of hitting his target.

This is the reason police have gradually trended away from the big Dirty Harry-style guns with high-powered rounds in favor of the high-capacity but lighter 9mm weapons. Why? To be effective, the weapon needs to hit its target. In the heat of the moment, the police prefer to have a margin of error.

So if a police officer needs to stop a bad guy with lethal force, how many shots does he need to expend before he has a reasonable chance of actually hitting a single assailant? A 9mm Glock used by a large number of police departments carries up to 19 rounds. If police officers were sent into service with only 10 rounds in their handguns, they would only have 10 chances at 15 percent to even hit an assailant.

Reload? Not at six feet away, a distance at which most of these conflicts take place. Remember the scene in “Pulp Fiction” in which two mob hitmen forget to check a back room for a potential threat. A panicky assailant pops out and empties a giant .44 revolver in their direction. Stunned, they realize that every single round missed both of them in spite of the shooter being within ten feet. One hitman credits divine intervention. The other chalks it up to a crazy fluke.

Yet this scene would not have required divine intervention. If a trained police officer has a 15 percent chance of hitting a person at six feet, it’s very plausible that a less-experienced civilian could miss six consecutive shots at that same range. Remember Hudgins? She had only two rounds in her firearm to fend off five attackers. Had the attackers been even slightly more persistent, she would have needed a full clip of at least 11 rounds to have a fighting chance to escape.

Consider another point. There have been several instances in American history in which a community has descended into anarchy. Sometimes it’s the result of a disaster such as Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. Other times, a vengeful mob takes to the street to spread destruction. Think the Los Angeles riots after Rodney King’s attackers were acquitted.

Remember the images of the Korean store owners protecting their shops with guns? If that were to happen in your city, how many rounds would you need in your magazine to credibly deter a mob from laying waste to your property or visiting bodily harm on you or your loved ones?

Finally, how many rounds would your wife, mother, or sister need if she were home with the baby when two attackers broke through the front door? In my humble opinion, the answer to that question, whether it’s 12 rounds or 19, defines the constitutional right. You know, the right about arming bears—mama bears.

Memories From 8 Americans Explain Why They Can Never Forget 9,"Human beings don’t like to dwell on the tragedies of our past. We want to move on. But trauma isn’t content to say in our yesterdays. It’s a fast-growing weed that—if left unchecked—spreads into today.

Eighteen years ago today, America suffered the collective trauma of the September 11th attacks. With each anniversary, there’s less fanfare, as though as a nation, we should be “over it” by now.

Yet we would not expect an individual to shake off trauma so easily. Would 18 years be enough to “get over” the death of a child? Being assaulted? Witnessing a murder? That person’s whole perspective on the world would probably be altered forever, whether he realized it or not.

Likewise, every American has his own profound memories of the 9/11 attacks. And though we may not realize it, we bring those memories into the voting booth, the economy, and the public square. 9/11 planted some potent seeds in the soil of the American soul, and its bitter harvest is still being reaped even now.

For the 18th anniversary of this world-altering tragedy, I asked a few folks to share their memories of that trauma—what they were feeling and how these memories remain with them today. Each is noted as the age he or she was at the time of the terrorist attacks.

Kathleen, Age 17, Haddonfield, NJ

I was seventeen years old waiting to be called to take my senior class picture. I stood in my high school hallway and waited in a short line where a “goth” student with jet-black hair and facial piercings asked me if I’d heard that the World Trade Center blew up. I was shocked and obviously emotional, but she relayed the message matter-of-factly so as to not contradict her steady, too-cool image.

After smiling brightly for my class photo, I returned to my science class where I shared the news with my teacher and classmates. Years later, my teacher informed me that I was the one who first told him the news, and I was forever etched that way in his memory.

During the day, students huddled into a small cafeteria lounge to watch a TV replaying the morning’s tragedies. Teachers let students use school phones to call long-distance phone numbers to check on relatives who worked in the city. For a day, a group of self-oriented high school seniors were sobered by the news of the greater community.

Billy, Age 49, New York, NY

I lived on the Upper West Side and on that day, I had a meeting scheduled with brokers from Guy Carpenter, a reinsurance company located on the 52nd floor of the South Tower. The broker had asked if I wanted to meet at 9:00 am. Well, I knew there was this great restaurant downtown at Duane and Reade Streets, so I said, “Why don’t we meet for lunch instead?” He laughed and agreed to meet later.

That morning while I was getting ready, someone told me to turn on the TV and we saw what was happening. The South Tower was struck at 9:03 am, and I was just watching in disbelief, wondering what would have happened if I hadn’t changed our meeting time.

We lived at 88th Street and Central Park West, which is about five or six miles from the World Trade Center site. Even that far north, you could smell it. For weeks, it smelled like an electrical fire. Nobody wanted to go downtown after it happened. It was in shambles, everything was closed and the cops were telling us not to come.

Today, I’m starting to forget things because it’s been a long time. But I do remember that, in those days after, people took it very personally as New Yorkers. This was our neighborhood and we were attacked. And not by some Timothy McVeigh guy, these were foreigners who attacked our home. I remember a lot of very anti-Arab feelings in those days because we were mad. Of course, that’s not the case now.

I also remember being on a city bus in the days following the attacks, and a Sikh man was riding along with his wife. People were yelling at him because he was wearing a turban. They thought he was Arab; Arabs don’t even wear turbans. Finally I had to tell people to leave him alone, that he was Indian—an ally—and his religion was all about peace.

Something that bothered me both then and now, was that 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi. So when I see our current relationship with the Saudis, I get frustrated. It was fantastic when President Bush went down to speak at Ground Zero, but then he went and attacked the wrong country. It wasn’t Iraqis who flew the plane into the towers.

Weeks after the attacks, when we finally did go down to Ground Zero, the thing that brought me to tears was seeing all the pictures that people had hung on the fences around the site. When you saw their faces, it really brought it home that these people suffered. These people died. And thank God we were safe.

I have so many pictures of New York with the Twin Towers. Whenever I see one, I have to keep it. Today, I’ll see pictures of the new Freedom Tower, and my first reaction is “That doesn’t belong there. The Twin Towers belong there.”

Peggy, Age 36, Alexandria, VA

I was at a Bible study at Calvary Road Baptist Church. Someone came into the room and said that “something major” was happening in New York City and in Washington, D.C.—just a few minutes away. We prayed and then they dismissed us. I remember thinking how quiet it was outside. The absence of air travel above my head was ominous.

I called my husband, Mark, and he explained that while he was passing over the 14th Street Bridge, he heard an explosion. He looked over his shoulder and saw the Pentagon on fire. Mark also told me that planes flew into the World Trade Center in New York.

I turned on the television for a few minutes to verify and gather some information. I made the conscious decision to turn off the TV to spend time with Emma Claire, my two-year-old daughter, and quietly reflect on the tragedy for so many innocent people.

I was just bewildered by the motives behind such a senseless act. I contemplated how these images of death and destruction that were in faraway places on the television had come to America, and I pondered how it would affect our way of life.

Rebekah, Age 16, Kingwood, TX

[Typing this out made me tear up all over again. It still feels so shocking and heartbreaking.]

I was an 11th grader in high school, sitting in my homeroom class. I remember hearing the news of the first tower going down. My teacher turned on the classroom TV that hung on the far left corner wall. Before we could wrap our heads around what was happening, I—along with a room full of other 16-year-olds—watched in live action as the cameras captured the second plane hitting the second tower.

I remember thinking, “This is something you see in movies, something that looks real but you know deep down that it it’s just camera tricks.” But this was 100% real, and we were in complete shock.

All day, they moved us from class to class, TVs on in every room, and all we did was watch the news footage until they released us to go home early later that afternoon.

Chadwyck, Age 9, Woodland Park, NJ

I grew up in New York City and my church was in Midtown. Early in 2001 my family had moved from New York state to Northern New Jersey near Montclair University. My family was all home on September 11th.

My dad, the pastor of our church, worked from a home office. We had a large TV, but only used it for the occasional evening movie and hosting a Superbowl party. I remember my dad calling down from his office to my siblings that we should turn on the TV. We were homeschooled and a couple of us were in the living room and kitchen doing schoolwork. I was surprised that the TV worked—but was further shocked by what I was seeing and hearing.

Our house was on a mountain, but the ridge obscured the New York skyline. After the attacks seemed to cease, we went outside to the road, which allowed a better view of the large dust cloud that was building over the city. It was surreal to struggle with the peace I felt at home, and in my faith, with the challenging reality I knew was happening a few miles away—and in a deeper sense, all around the world.

We had often talked about global and national events around the house, but this was the first time that something global felt real. It had always been an abstraction. (I recall later realizing that my parents had lived through the Cold War – which in my young mind appeared to be “history” too far in the past to really mean anything.) I was shocked that we appeared to be at war. Up until then, the price of the security I felt as an American was completely undervalued.

All but a few families of our church lived and worked in Manhattan. I thankfully didn’t know anyone personally who died. However, many of my friends in my broader community lost fathers and close connections. Members of my home church still suffer from immune disorders and breathing problems that started after the attacks.

The closeness of community in the months after the attacks still impresses me. The attacks transformed strangers into a community. The resulting patriotism of that time is frankly astonishing, considering all the petty squabbles that had previously (and currently) divided America.

Closer to home, I remember the feeling of walking down the normally semi-hostile streets of NYC. After 9/11, those streets had been transformed into a place of intense local unity. We were New Yorkers. We’d had something terrible and unexpected thrown at us and—while previously we didn’t have a care about the stranger on the street—now we did. And we were stronger for it.

Over time, that feeling has faded, and the only other place I’ve found it is at my local church. But it gave me a picture of a community that cares for one another—even if we don’t know everything about each other.

Sofia, Age 17, San Pedro Sula, Honduras

I was in high school on September 11, 2001. My school was Christian, so we had chapel every day. On that day we went to chapel, like any other day. One of the preachers stood up and told us that an airplane had crashed into one of the twin towers in New York City. Not that it would be in any way funny, but I kept waiting for him to tell us that he was just joking. The more he went on, I just could not believe what he was saying.

At that age, I would regularly interpret from English to Spanish for North American church missions trips which came to Honduras to bless my people. I had made many and very dear North American friends through the interpreting.

Even though I knew most—if not all—did not live in New York, I was so worried about them. I longed to hear that they were okay. As soon as I arrived home, I rushed for the news so I could get more information. I watched report after report trying to understand, comprehend, process, take-in…

I don’t remember how long it took me to reach my friends in the United States. I do remember reaching the first friend I ever made on my first missions trip. She asked if I would please keep newspapers for her of that day. She wanted to be able to see the world’s perspective on the event.

I kept the paper for years. I don’t know what happened to it and hate that I no longer have it.

My husband and I visited the site in 2016 and the museum in 2018. I don’t even know what to say about the memorial and museum, but it still stirs my heart.

Diana, Age 45, Langley, VA

At the time, I was a caretaker for a lady with Alzheimer’s in an old house that was right by CIA headquarters. I was in the kitchen, listening to the TV in the background. After the first plane hit, everyone on TV was hoping it was just an accident with a small plane. But I knew—the bombing had already happened years before at the World Trade Center. And then the second tower was hit. It took away the illusion that the oceans surrounding us would protect us.

It was worse than the day President Kennedy was shot because we didn’t know what the beginning and the end of it was. There were so many rumors about more possible targets or attacks. I was so worried that if the CIA got hit, we’d have to take cover in the basement—how would I get my patient down there? The house was old and the basement had rickety steps and a dirt floor with rats all around.

After the attacks, I had gotten into such a negative frame of mind; I was obsessed with reading and seeing everything I could. It upset me, but I had to know everything. At the time, I was dating a German. At first, he was very sympathetic, but after a while, he got tired of hearing about it. He didn’t understand—especially our need to get back at the people who’d done this. I told him, “They came to our house and did this. Somebody’s gotta get ein Schlag – a smack.” Americans wouldn’t let this go unanswered.

A few weeks later, I went to New York to visit a friend. She lived right around Ground Zero and they hadn’t been allowed to return to their homes for at least a month. Cleaning crews had to clear all the white dust that covered the whole neighborhood after the attacks. That dust was from the building debris, chemicals—and the remains of the people who were killed.

She told me that after she was allowed back into the apartment, she pulled out a videotape and there was still white dust all over top of it. She didn’t know what to do with it because she knew that dust could have been someone’s ashes.

Because they were so worried people would leave the city, her building waived her rent while they were closed and even gave people cash to stay. But my friend felt badly about taking the money. There were so many businesses in the neighborhood that were forced to close for weeks. Even after they reopened, no one was coming down there. All the tourists were gone. So my friend took that money from her landlords and just went and spent it at all the shops down there, trying to keep them in business [starts crying].

Bobby, Age 33, NYPD’s 52nd Precinct, The Bronx, NY

That morning, I got a call from my brother Philip, an Air Force pilot, right after the first plane hit the towers. I was asleep and his call woke me up. He told me to turn on the TV. I said, “What channel?” And he said, “It doesn’t matter.” When I saw what was going on on the screen, I said, “Holy cow.” Only that’s not the word I used.

I got off the phone with my brother and called my wife Jackie, telling her what happened. As we were on the phone, the second plane hit and we knew immediately what was happening. I knew, “I gotta get to work.” I found out later that there was an official recall of all officers in the city, but I didn’t know about it then. I just knew I had to report for duty.

During the day of the 11th, we weren’t allowed to go to Ground Zero. Everything was a mess and the higher ups assumed that any police they’d send down there were going to get killed, so they kept us at our precinct in The Bronx.

All the officers reported for muster that morning at the school next door to the precinct, which was the only place around with enough space to hold us all. The school was right across from this bodega that was owned by Arabs. Me and a lot of guys at the precinct would go there to get coffee from time to time.

Now, it was still early in the day, but both towers had already fallen. There were officers from our precinct that we knew were on duty downtown from the night before—at court appearances and things like that. As far as we knew at the time, they were dead. And the Arabs who owned this bodega across the street were celebrating, doing the equivalent of the Irish jig.

Me and a few other guys were about to cross the street and confront them when our commanding officer grabbed us by the shoulder and stopped us. Our C.O. did right by us; we would have lost our jobs that day.

After that, nobody went to that bodega again. Even in that neighborhood, which wasn’t exactly friendly to cops, the neighborhood folks wouldn’t stand by that. They didn’t go either. It got to the point that they had to sell the bodega and move out of the neighborhood.

On the night of the 11th, going into the 12th, I was finally sent down to Ground Zero. It was surreal. You know, I wasn’t in the military, I didn’t serve in war, but I’m a history buff and that place looked like Berlin in 1945. Just bombed out and destroyed.

As cops, if we were working at Ground Zero, we were there to secure the perimeter. Since all the apartments and businesses were evacuated, no one should have been down there. We were there to make sure no one was looting and that only first responders and construction workers were down at the site. I mean, this was a mass grave—no one else could be there.

When we got sent down there, we’d be down there for hours at a time. When we’d finally get a break for a meal, we’d just be desperate for a place to close our eyes for a minute. Trinity Church opened its doors to us as a peaceful place to rest away from the scene. You’d walk into that church and see all these cops, sleeping across the pews. After everything that had happened, that church welcoming us was such a relief—and contrast—to what had happened in the attacks.

We were able to dig at the site, but we did it as volunteers on our own time. Whenever those of us digging would find a body or remains, everything on the site would stop. All the digging, all the talking—everyone was just silent and solemn. They would carry out the remains draped in an American flag.

We all knew somebody who died—it was just a matter of how close we were to them. Orio Palmer, an FDNY battalion chief who was married to my cousin—he died rescuing folks trapped in the South Tower. I knew Steven Driscoll, an officer on an ESU [Emergency Service Unit] truck. Also, the husband of a woman I worked with…we all knew someone.

But now people are forgetting. Every year that goes by, it’s less and less that people remember.

We’ve done a better job remembering Pearl Harbor than 9/11. Look at that congresswoman from Minnesota who said “some people did something.” I still have the newspapers from that day. The front page of the New York Daily News—where somebody is taking a header off the World Trade Center—to an elected U.S. official saying that? How did we get from there to here?

***

9/11 was the deadliest terrorist act in world history. It claimed 2,606 lives in Lower Manhattan, 265 on the four hijacked flights and 125 at the Pentagon. More than 6,000 others were injured. This is to say nothing of the health impact on 9/11 rescue workers or in the wars that followed.

It was the bloodiest day in American history since the Civil War. It revoked the faith that we were safe on our own soil. It made celebrities of terrorists. It shook America’s sense of self and its role on the world stage. That’s not something you bounce back from in 18 years.

As any historian can tell you, 18 years is a drop in the bucket; history will not see 2001 and 2019 as distinct eras in American history. Future generations will not see events like the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the 2008 financial crisis, the elections of Barack Obama and Donald Trump or the school shooting epidemic as unrelated events. They are all—at least in part—the legacy of 9/11. Never forget.

Here’s Your Guide To The Third Democratic Presidential Debate,"Ten candidates will take the stage Thursday night for the third Democratic presidential debate at Texas Southern University, a public historically black college in Houston.

Unlike the last two rounds of live candidate-sparring, this month’s event will take place just one night, with only 10 candidates qualifying for a podium on stage after the Democratic National Committee’s (DNC) participation requirement threshold nearly doubled. To qualify, candidates had to show 130,000 unique donors that included 400 donors from at least 20 states, in addition to garnering a minimum of 2 percent support in at least four pre-approved polls.

Hosted by ABC News in partnership with Univision, a panel of four moderators will run the show, including ABC’s Linsey Davis, George Stephanopoulos, David Muir, and Univision’s Jorge Ramos, meeting the DNC’s criteria for at least one female and one non-white person on the moderating panel.

The debate is scheduled for 8 p.m. EDT and is expected to run three hours. The event will be broadcast on ABC News, KTRK-TV, ABC News Live, and Univision, which will air the debate in Spanish. The debate will also be streamed online through Hulu Live, Roku, Facebook, AppleTV, Amazon Fire, YouTube, Apple News, and Twitter.

A Look at the Lineup

Here’s Thursday’s lineup as the candidates will appear on stage from left to right:

Amy Klobuchar, U.S. senator from Minnesota

Cory Booker, U.S. senator from New Jersey

Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana

Bernie Sanders, U.S. senator from Vermont

Joe Biden, former vice president

Elizabeth Warren, U.S. senator from Massachusetts

Kamala Harris, U.S. senator from California

Andrew Yang, tech entrepreneur

Beto O’Rourke, former U.S. representative from Texas

Julián Castro, former secretary of Housing and Urban Development

Absent from the debate stage will be several candidates who failed to meet the DNC’s thresholds. Billionaire Tom Steyer met the donor threshold but hit 2 percent support in only three polls, not four, before the September debate deadline. Steyer has since garnered enough support in subsequent polls, qualifying the financier and philanthropist for the next round of primary debates expected to be held mid-October.

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, also came close to qualifying, meeting the donor threshold but only scoring enough support in two polls. If Gabbard polls 2 percent or higher in just two more polls in the coming weeks, she will qualify to join the other candidates in the fourth round of primary debates.

Candidates still running who did not come close to qualifying include self-help author Marianne Williamson, who came three polls short but met the donor threshold, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, and former Reps. John Delaney of Maryland and Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania.

Missing the primetime primary debates is a significant blow to campaigns struggling to reach national audiences with their message, so much so that New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand cited missing Thursday’s debate as a reason for dropping out of the race late last month.

Being in the Debates Isn’t Always Beneficial

What happens during the debates can also yield significant consequences, for better or worse, for the candidates participating.

In the last round of debates in July, Sanders and Warren stood out the first night, as the two most progressive candidates taking center stage parried off attacks from moderate candidates, critical of their radical policies. On the second night, Harris’ status as a top-tier candidate, which she developed after a well-received performance in the first round of debates in June, was threatened when Gabbard led attacks on Harris’ record as an aggressive prosecutor in California.

“Sen. Harris said she’s proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she’ll be a prosecutor president, but I’m deeply concerned about this record.” Gabbard said.

She put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations, and then laughed about it when she was asked if she’d ever smoked marijuana. She blocked evidence that would have freed a man from death row until the courts forced her to do so. She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of California. And she fought to keep cash bail system in place that impacts poor people in the worst kind of way.

[Buy a limited edition “Kamala Is A Cop” T-shirt here.]

Harris saw a sizable drop in support following those attacks but remains a top-five candidate in RealClearPolitics’ latest aggregate of polls.

This week, Harris unveiled a hodgepodge of proposals on criminal justice reform ahead of Thursday night’s debate in anticipation of renewed attacks on her reputation as a scorched-earth prosecutor.

All eyes will also be on Warren and former vice president Joe Biden Thursday night, as the front-runner will face the Massachusetts senator, who has been a consistent second- and third-place contender, for the first time on stage this election cycle.

Biden has made a series of back-to-back gaffes in the past month, bringing renewed doubts about the former vice president’s age and sharpness in the race, at 76 years old, as he looks to take on President Donald Trump next fall. At the first debate in June, Biden appeared frail and forgetful on stage, causing pundits to question his capacity to run in the general election and operate in the Oval Office.

Why The Left Moved From Loving Thomas Jefferson To Hating Him,"This is an excerpt of “The War on History: The Conspiracy to Rewrite America’s Past,” out today and available to purchase wherever you buy books.

Weighing in on the debate over Confederate statues in 2017, President Donald Trump said to reporters, “George Washington was a slave owner. . . are we going to take down statues to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson? What do you think of Thomas Jefferson? You like him?. . .Are we going to take down the statue? Because he was a major slave owner.”

Trump’s insinuation that activists would turn their attention to the Founders after they were done with Confederates was mocked by many in the media and even some historians on the premise that the difference between the Founders and the Confederates would be obvious to Americans.

“It’s the difference between a monument to the founder of our nation, and a monument to a key figure in an effort to break apart the nation,” said Douglas Blackmon, an author and senior fellow at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center in an interview with the Washington Post. “The most kind explanation of that can only be ignorance, and I don’t say that to insult the president.”

Unfortunately, the president was right. First, they came for the Confederates, and then they very quickly came for everyone else, the Founders included. This was always the real goal: to uproot and demolish traditional America, to attack the men, institutions, and ideas that set this nation’s course over the centuries. For them, America was never great. And to sell the rest of us on that proposition, they need to tear down everything that represents American greatness.

The Founders, the American Revolution they made, and the Declaration of Independence are at the top of their list. The Declaration and its author, Thomas Jefferson, are special targets of their calumny. If they can persuade America to despise and reject our Founding, they will be well on their way to their ultimate goal of “fundamentally transforming” the United States.

The Founders Were Motivated by Noble Ideas

What made our Revolution one of the very few successful revolutions—arguably the only one—in the history of mankind? Progressive thinkers in the early twentieth century attributed the American Revolution to economic factors, using quasi-Marxist historical interpretations to claim that the Founders were just wealthy men trying to protect their interests.

These leftists promoted their vision of the Founders as anti-Democratic to justify upending the institutions the Founders created, and they had some success in doing so. But historians in the later twentieth century, like Gordon Wood and Forrest McDonald, reexamined the progressives’ history and found it wanting.

Reducing the Founders’ motivations to mere economics was wildly off base. Ideas, not base interests, motivated the men who founded the United States. A simplistic economic narrative was inadequate to the complicated history of the American rupture with England.

While the causes of America’s Revolution remain hotly contested, historian Walter McDougal has succinctly summed up the multiple factors in play: “The whole experience of the colonists dating back to 1607 . . . made self-government, religious freedom, economic opportunity, and territorial growth inseparable. Almost everyone from Massachusetts to Georgia could agree that civil and religious liberty went hand in hand, liberty could not long survive without virtue, an exploding population could not survive without virtue, and an exploding population could aspire to no liberty at all if its territorial and commercial expansion were artificially choked.”

The foundation for an independent and unique experiment in self-government in the United States had already been established over generations, from the time Columbus arrived in the New World, through the English migrations and settlement in the thirteen colonies, and up to the moment when the British Parliament and King George III foolishly tried to put the genie back in the bottle and chain this burgeoning nation to their will.

The Founders: From Untouchable to Deplorable

And perhaps no man represented the soul of that new nation yearning for liberty better than Thomas Jefferson. For much of American history, the Founders were untouchable. Even as many powerful men, including Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, worked to undermine their legacy, few would have dared attack them openly.

Members of the Progressive Movement in the early twentieth century may have opposed the principles of constitutional government that the founding generation created, but they carefully avoided publicly denouncing them. President Franklin Roosevelt’s “Second Bill of Rights,” harkening back to the original Bill of Rights, was a clever sleight of hand, a successful attempt to convince the American people that ideas in fundamental opposition to those of the Founders were somehow what the Founders would have wanted.

It was Roosevelt who had the Thomas Jefferson Memorial constructed in Washington, D.C., in the 1930s. This is somewhat ironic given the fact that Jefferson’s strict constructionist constitutional principles would have prevented him from carrying out such a federal project. Roosevelt’s New Deal economics would also likely have horrified Jefferson.

Today, attacks on the Founders typically start with Jefferson. With the emphasis now on what the Founders didn’t do (abolish slavery) rather than what they did (build the foundations for the freest country in human history), the contrast between Jefferson’s eloquent denunciations of slavery and his failure to put his principles into action make him an easy target for those want to paint the Founders as rank hypocrites.

Casting Shade on George Washington

The self-contradictions of the author of the Declaration of Independence on what is increasingly the only issue modern audiences care about has made Jefferson ripe for destruction. That’s not to say that other Founders haven’t found themselves on the wrong side of the war on history. Even George Washington, the “indispensable man” of the Revolution, has had a few salvos thrown his way.

If Jefferson falls to this crusade, there will be no stopping the eventual takedown of Washington.

The famed Christ Church in Alexandria, Virginia, which Washington attended for years, decided to take down a plaque in Washington’s honor in the name of inclusivity. The church, which has displayed a banner outside saying “All are welcome—no exceptions,” made an exception for the Father of Our Country.

Perhaps even more pathetically, the San Francisco school board voted unanimously to destroy a mural with George Washington at a public school because it also depicted slaves and a dead American Indian. The school board deemed the mural too offensive for modern sensitivities.

The mural was painted in 1936 by artist Victor Arnautoff, who was, ironically enough, a man of the Left in his time and was trying to present a less flattering portrayal of Washington. No matter—staying sufficiently “woke” typically prevails over reason or thoughtfulness.

If Jefferson falls to this crusade, there will be no stopping the eventual takedown of Washington. That Washington freed his slaves upon his death will be seen as insufficient—just as Jefferson’s writing the greatest anti-slavery document of the modern age fails to save him from scathing attacks. Jefferson’s perceived hypocrisy in regard to the institution of slavery has made him the chief target of modern attacks on the Founders.

In fact, this isn’t the first time Jefferson’s legacy has come under siege. In the nineteenth century, one radical abolitionist wrote of Jefferson’s failure on the slavery issue, “Never did a man achieve more fame for what he did not do.” That statement may have been true at the time, but Americans today are starting to forget what he did do. They have lost touch with the immense accomplishments of this venerated American whose greatest fault is that he dared criticize an institution as old as mankind while failing to extinguish it within a single generation.

Remember the Precious Gift from the Founders

This is no reason to abandon Jefferson, who may be one of the most influential men of the last millennium. Jefferson and the Founders delivered to posterity a timeless model for man’s liberty and flourishing that has never been matched. Americans of the past generally revered the Founding Fathers and what they accomplished for good reason.

Though the Founders were fallible, like anyone else, unlike anyone else, they built a uniquely successful system for ordering society upon great truths about human nature. But if they are regarded at all in modern times, the Founding Fathers are increasingly dismissed for their failings, large or small, while the transformative nature of what they accomplished is downplayed or simply neglected.

Americans would be foolish to abandon this inheritance. At the critical moment of our nation’s conception, the American colonies contained a deep roster of talent. And the Revolution was a fortuitous moment for these talented men. Few of the great statesmen and philosophers through history ever had anything like the opportunity they had: to create enduring institutions for a new civilization at the moment of its birth.

Without Them, We’d Be Lost

Thomas Jefferson, among the greatest of that illustrious group, was a key figure in the early debates over what America could and would be. Though his archnemesis Alexander Hamilton—who has had a bit of a revival of late—certainly had his victories and did much to set the course of our burgeoning country, Jefferson’s ideas have had a unique impact on America for two and a half centuries—from Independence to the Civil War and Emancipation to the Civil Rights Movement.

Mid-twentieth-century historian James Thurlow Adams surmised that, without Hamilton, our country “would assuredly have been killed in body,” yet, “without Jefferson the new nation might have lost its soul.” That the United States in the twentieth century is an unrivaled superpower of vast economic and military strength is a tribute to Hamilton, who foresaw our fate as a commercial and military power. But in times of turmoil and uncertainty over who we are, generations of Americans have turned to Jefferson as a source of inspiration.

America is at its best when it is strong in body and soul. When our civic traditions are under threat, it is to Jefferson, the original articulator of our liberties, that we look for renewal. Americans through the generations have fought over the meaning of the Founding—but always reclaimed its legacy. The Founders have been criticized in every era, but that criticism used to be made within the framework of understanding that their accomplishments were enormous and worth studying.

Remembering Only the Vices, Never the Virtues

Now a pernicious dogmatism about the Founders’ failures is obscuring the most important aspects of their legacy. We no longer embrace what made them great while occasionally being disappointed by their all-too-human shortcomings. Instead, their flaws are magnified out of proportion and out of the context of the time they lived in. And, perhaps because of the loftiness of rhetoric, no Founder has suffered more from this way of thinking than Thomas Jefferson. His reputation has undergone a dramatic reversal—nowhere more than at the university he created and was so proud of.

Thomas Jefferson’s face appears alongside those of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt on Mount Rushmore for good reason. He has been one of America’s most celebrated men and presidents. But the famous Virginian never cared much for touting his presidential legacy.

Jefferson’s tomb, located near his Charlottesville home, is adorned by an impressive granite obelisk with an inscription representing what he believed were his greatest accomplishments. Jefferson specially designed the gravestone with meticulous care. The obelisk reads: “Here was buried Thomas Jefferson Author of the Declaration of American Independence of the Statute of Virginia for religious freedom & Father of the University of Virginia.” “By these, as testimonials that I have lived, I wish most to be remembered,” Jefferson wrote.

Thomas Jefferson Gives to Even Those Who Hate Him

If Americans entirely forget everything about Jefferson or turn on him as a monstrous hypocrite, they will still enjoy the fruits of these three indelible marks of his legacy: a nation founded on the timeless principles of liberty and the natural equality of men laid out in the Declaration, religious liberty enshrined in our laws, and a commitment to education that has produced a population capable of sustaining freedom.

Thanks to Jefferson’s care and enormous personal sacrifice, the school ultimately found its footing, becoming one of the most prestigious universities in the country.

All of these things are under attack in America, but at least they exist in our national DNA, waiting to be rediscovered. Noticeably missing from Jefferson’s list of accomplishments was his service as president of the United States or in any other public office that he held in his long political career.

Jefferson, the man of ideas, wished for future generations to know him by the “self-evident truths” that he would pass down to them, not by the practical compromises of his political career. He hoped these ideas would be transmitted through his beloved school, the University of Virginia, which he founded in 1819.

The university went through some tumultuous early years, and many thought it was doomed to fail. Charlottesville was seen as a backwater; the early students were often substandard. What’s more, the school was created as a radical experiment. It wasn’t attached to a religious denomination—though religion itself wasn’t discouraged—and students were expected to abide by an honor code rather than the strict rules that governed other universities, a tradition that continues today.

The early struggles of the school took a huge toll on Jefferson. A near-rebellion by professors and students in 1825, just a year before Jefferson’s death, brought the distraught and ailing Founder to tears. But thanks to his care and enormous personal sacrifice, the school ultimately found its footing, becoming one of the most prestigious universities in the country.

Students at UVA have more or less venerated Mr. Jefferson, as they reverently call him, ever since. It would be unthinkable to denounce him. Until now. The traditional Grounds of UVA have played host to many tributes to Jefferson, but one act in the late nineteenth century was perhaps the school’s greatest demonstration of devotion to its founder.

They Once Loved Him Enough to Save His Statue

The Rotunda, which Jefferson designed, caught fire in 1895. Through the fearsome inferno, in a daring deed of bravery, students dragged Jefferson’s statue out of the Rotunda, allegedly on a mattress. The life-sized marble statue, created by sculptor Alexander Galt in 1860, took a few bumps in the dramatic rescue, but it survives to this day.

UVA wouldn’t exist without Mr. Jefferson, but that hasn’t stopped some of today’s students and professors from trying to erase the institution’s connection to its founder.

Students managed to save many of the books in the Rotunda too, something that would undoubtedly have made the legendary bibliophile happy. UVA wouldn’t exist without Mr. Jefferson, but that hasn’t stopped some of today’s students and professors from trying to erase the institution’s connection to its founder.

A group of UVA students and outside community activists gathered in front of the restored Rotunda in 2017 to protest Jefferson and “white supremacy” after a group of white supremacists had gathered in the city to protest the removal of Confederate statues. Any distinction between Confederates and the Founders seemed to make little difference to those assembled on the Grounds.

The university had already gone out of its way to acknowledge Jefferson’s legacy as a slaveholder—and even planned to erect a memorial to the enslaved laborers who helped build the school—but this clearly wasn’t enough for the aggrieved. Protesters besieged the Jefferson statue that stands in front of the Rotunda and placed signs on it calling the Founding Father a “rapist” and a “racist.” Then, in a defiant and illegal act, they covered the statue with a giant shroud.

One would think this act would have provoked a harsh and defiant rebuke from school authorities in defense of the man to whom they owe so much. Instead, UVA President Teresa Sullivan offered only mild condemnation of the attack on the school’s founder and seemed to accept the behavior as a reasonable protest.

“I strongly disagree with the protestors’ decision to cover the Jefferson statue,” Sullivan said. “I also recognize the rights of those present at the protest to express their emotions and opinions regarding the recent horrific events that occurred on our Grounds and in Charlottesville,” Sullivan wrote. “Our community continues to heal, and we must remain respectful of one another.” Apparently “one another” did not include the school’s founder.

Too Politically Incorrect at the School He Founded

This wasn’t the first time that Jefferson had come under attack at the school. Sullivan had been embroiled in another controversy the year before when students and faculty publicly lambasted her for quoting Jefferson in messages to the student body.

“For many of us, the inclusion of Jefferson quotations in these emails undermines the message of unity, equality, and civility that you are attempting to convey,” read a statement to Sullivan from the angry students and teachers. “I think that Jefferson is often celebrated for his accomplishments with little or no acknowledgement of the atrocities he committed against hundreds of human beings,” wrote a UVA psychology professor.

The attacks on his legacy and the lack of an effective rebuttal would have been almost unthinkable a century ago.

Thomas Jefferson is now politically incorrect at the school he founded. While he still has defenders and admirers at the university, the attacks on his legacy and the lack of an effective rebuttal would have been almost unthinkable a century ago.

The collapse of Jefferson’s reputation has spread far beyond the college campus. All around the country, state Democratic Party chapters are changing the name of Jefferson-Jackson Day dinners, which were named after Jefferson and Andrew Jackson, two figures they used to celebrate as their party’s founders. But no more.

Even the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C., the cherished project of Franklin Roosevelt, has come under fire. In the wake of the Charlottesville controversy, the Reverend Al Sharpton absurdly suggested that public financial support of the monument cease and that the statue of Jefferson be moved to a private museum.

“When you look at the fact that public monuments are supported by public funds you’re asking me to subsidize the insult of my family,” Sharpton said. “I would repeat that the public should not be paying to uphold somebody who has had that kind of background. You have private museums, you have other things that you may want to do there.”

This is a shabby way to treat the legacy of a man who contributed in so many ways, great and small, to who we are today. The attacks on Jefferson are emblematic of the overall assault on the Founding, an attempt to eject from our institutions, culture, and people the philosophy that underpins the American Republic and has left a permanent stamp on the American character.

What the Left Really Hates Is America Itself

From the perspective of the modern Left, that philosophy, that Republic, and that American character are all problematic—in dire need of being “fundamentally transform[ed].” The Founding of the United States was a pivotal moment not just in American history but in all of human history. What the Founders achieved was the creation not just of a new nation but of a “novus ordo seclorum”—a new order of the ages.

The thirteen colonies, with a population of only about three million people—roughly equivalent to the population of Arkansas today—produced one of the most extraordinary generations ever to grace the earth. Gaining Independence from Great Britain, the preeminent world power at the time, was itself impressive. But even more important, the Founders, drawing on the wisdom of millennia of philosophy and history, defined what it meant to be a free country.

They transformed their collection of colonies, at the time little more than a New World backwater, into the focus of Western civilization. In a few short centuries, this fledgling republic, once a rare outlier in a sea of monarchies and other tyrannical governments, bloomed into the most powerful nation on earth.

But it has always drawn sustenance from its original dedication to freedom. Expanding on that tradition, America became the “Empire of Liberty” Jefferson once dreamed about.

"First Border-Crossing Terrorist Is On Trial, And The Media Won't Cover It","Many who have professionally worried, as did former Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, that violent jihadists might illegally cross the United States’ southern border are often sanctimoniously challenged with this: “Name a single U.S. border-crossing immigrant asylum-seeker who ever committed a terrorist attack.”

Introducing Abdulahi Hasan Sharif of Somalia.

In 2011, Sharif had himself smuggled from Somalia through Brazil and Central America. Then he entered the United States over the Mexico-California border and claimed asylum. Sharif went on to Canada, where he allegedly conducted a double vehicle-ramming and stabbing rampage in 2017 in Edmonton, Alberta, that severely injured a police officer and four other people. He was carrying an Islamic State flag in one of the ramming vehicles.

Those who paid attention to this case were too few and far between ever to mention Sharif a year ago when President Trump provoked a denialist media backlash by claiming the border was vulnerable to violent jihadists migrating from distant Muslim-majority countries.

The 32-year-old Sharif is now on public trial in Canada, facing 11 counts of attempted murder, aggravated assault, and dangerous driving. While he occupies a consequential homeland security pedestal of first border-crosser to conduct a jihadi attack in North America, his backstory remains largely unexcavated for learnable lessons to U.S. homeland security. That may or may not change in the coming weeks of a trial.

That Islamic extremists would infiltrate the United States through the southern border is a prospect that professional homeland security authorities have taken seriously since 9/11. Agencies have long invested in countering the perceived border threat. For instance, Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations agents are deployed throughout Latin America to disrupt smuggling networks that specialize in transporting foreign citizens from Muslim-majority countries such as Somalia into the United States.

The government labels such migrants “special interest aliens” so they can be flagged to ostensibly undergo enhanced security screenings, such as threat assessment interviews, to which Spanish-speaking people are not subject. As I said during recent field reporting on the migrant trails in Panama and Costa Rica, travelers on U.S. terrorism watch lists have been apprehended at the border or en route in recent years. Perhaps because as many as 20 such suspects a year were caught in various American security nets, none had yet been able to attack in North America – until Sharif.

Trump’s notion that something like this could happen outraged the usual suspects as baseless fearmongering even though dozens of Islamist terrorists successfully snuck over Europe’s external borders while posing as asylum-seeking refugees and these terrorists committed attacks across the continent, such as the devastating attacks in Paris and Brussels. Beyond Sharif, Europe offered much proof of concept.

The full story has yet to be plumbed to learn more about how Sharif got through the American cordon, what his motives and intentions were when he entered California through Mexico, and whether opportunities were missed to interdict him prior to the Edmonton attack.

What We Do and Don’t Know

On Sept. 30, 2017, Sharif allegedly drove a vehicle into an Edmonton police officer outside Alberta’s Commonwealth Stadium during a local championship soccer match. Sharif got out of the car and allegedly stabbed the officer before running away. An ISIS flag was found inside the car.

A few hours later, Sharif showed up in downtown Edmonton driving a rented U-Haul cube truck, which he allegedly used to run over four citizens, per incitement propaganda from overseas Islamist extremist groups. The truck overturned after a dramatic chase, and Sharif was arrested. All of his victims survived.

It soon emerged in Canadian Press reporting that Sharif had been smuggled to the Mexico-California border on July 12, 2011. According to reporting by Jonny Wakefield of the Edmonton Journal, Sharif left Somalia in 2008 and traveled through Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Namibia, and Angola before flying to Brazil. (See interactive route map here.) Once in Brazil, Sharif worked at a chicken-processing plant before hiring smugglers to help him continue on to Mexico.

Sharif crossed over from Tijuana to the San Ysidro Port of Entry and claimed asylum. For reasons unknown, U.S. immigration Judge Carmene Depaolo in San Diego, only a month or so later, ordered Sharif to be deported to Somalia instead of granting him asylum. Was Sharif caught lying? Did investigators find derogatory intelligence about him somewhere? Or did Sharif abandon his asylum claim so he could be legally clear to seek status in Canada?

Whatever the case, deportation never happened because no civil authority in Somalia had developed enough to accept deportees from the United States. And because various U.S. court rulings and policies didn’t allow for such stateless people to be indefinitely detained, Sharif was released on an order of supervision. He was supposed to report to ICE regularly but failed to show up on Jan. 24, 2012, because he was in Canada by then, according to Wakefield’s reporting.

Wakefield learned Sharif traveled to Buffalo, New York, and with help from a refugee support group called Vive La Casa, he crossed into Fort Erie, Ontario, on Jan. 9, 2012, and filed a refugee claim that was granted later that year. Canadian immigration officials said database checks uncovered no information about Sharif that raised red flags, a usual finding with Somalis because no records exist on most citizens in that anarchic country. Likewise, Wakefield cited ICE saying Sharif had been found to have “no criminal history,” records of which would not exist.

Within 36 months of entering Canada, though, in 2015, Sharif was on the radar of Canadian intelligence agencies for espousing extremist Islamist views that included genocidal beliefs related to Islamist teachings. The RCMP’s Integrated National Security Enforcement Team found cause to interview Sharif that year. Assistant Commissioner Marlin Degrand told the Toronto Star there was insufficient evidence to charge him at the time.

Questions Worth Asking and Answering

How thoroughly did ICE screen Sharif when he was in custody after crossing the U.S. border?

Did any intelligence failures occur in which Sharif’s background, motives, and connections to U.S.-designated terrorist groups could have been discovered?

What became of Sharif’s American asylum claim?

Did Canada’s immigration services know about Sharif’s deportation order and seek information about that or the fact that Sharif was violating his supervised release terms when he entered Canada?

Sharif spelled his name differently on his Canadian documents than on U.S. documents. Did this matter in some way?

Given that Somalis generally had no government-issued identification of any sort in 2011, how did Sharif obtain the identification documents and visas necessary to clear various customs checkpoints during his journey from Africa to Brazil?

When did Sharif radicalize? Was it before he entered California in 2011 or when Canadian intelligence flagged him for espousing genocidal beliefs in 2015?

One U.S. Committee Demanded an Investigation

In October 2018, during its final hours under Republican control, the House Oversight and Reform Committee’s Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., issued a letter formally requesting that DHS’s Office of Inspector General investigate the Sharif case because “it appears there has been no comprehensive study of the incident.” There’s been no word on whether DHS OIG ever took up the committee’s request.

The committee wanted to know, for instance, how well DHS was vetting special interest aliens for potential terrorism connections (in line with ICE policy to do so), how often such migrants committed asylum fraud and were prosecuted, and how many were released early on bonds before they could undergo threat assessment interviews.

The committee cited a 2011 OIG report (the same year Sharif crossed into California) and a follow-up 2018 OIG report that showed ICE was neither screening nor checking databases for all aliens from countries of national security concern, which would include Somalia.

“The Committee is deeply concerned the vulnerabilities existing in 2011, which allowed this individual to enter, be released, and transit through the U.S. may still exist today,” Gowdy wrote.

What Next?

Alberta prosecutors never charged Sharif under terrorism statutes. Thanks to issues of relevance, it seems unlikely the trial in Edmonton will reveal the kind of information pertinent to American national security and, perhaps, not even to Canadian security.

Prosecutors will be interested mainly in proving that Sharif was behind the wheel of the two vehicles and was the one who stabbed the police officer. A publication ban has blanketed the proceedings, preventing local journalists from reporting anything not in actual court testimony.

The most certain way for America to get the information it needs to protect and serve is for DHS OIG to go forward on the House committee’s request for investigation — or, of course, a full-court investigation by one of our country’s leading media outlets.

Yet no one should expect any coverage of this case from American media, probably because writing about Sharif would require them to emphatically acknowledge a terrorist actually did cross the border and attack. Not to mention that Trump, after all the media ridicule, was correct in saying that potential terrorists have crossed that border and could again.

Three Questions Debate Moderators Should Ask The 2020 Front-Runners,"The largest 2020 Democratic debate stage of this cycle, featuring 12 candidates, will be held in Westerville, Ohio on Tuesday. The event will be moderated by CNN’s Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper as well as The New York Times’ national editor Marc Lacey.

The candidates for tomorrow’s debate include:

Joe Biden (27.8%) Cory Booker (1.3%) Pete Buttigieg (5%) Julián Castro (1%) Tulsi Gabbard (0.7%) Kamala Harris (4.5%) Amy Klobuchar (1.3%) Beto O’Rourke (1.8%) Bernie Sanders (15.2%) Tom Steyer (0.7%) Elizabeth Warren (26%) Andrew Yang (2.7%)

Despite the crowded stage, polling indicates the race is narrowing down to three front-runners: former Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and Senator Bernie Sanders. Understanding each of the these front-runners before the field of candidates inevitably narrows is crucial for Democratic primary voters.

Here are three questions that Democratic primary voters deserve an answer to during tomorrow nights debate:

1. For Biden: Would your son, Hunter Biden, be allowed to do work with foreign entities during a Biden presidency?

This question might serve as a double edged sword to Biden, but nevertheless, would be an important one to ask. If Biden were to say “No, Hunter could not serve,” that implies he understands that his son’s work with a Ukrainian oil company is a conflict of interest and could interfere with his ability to do his job as President effectively. Not allowing Hunter Biden to work with foreign entities during a Biden presidency is essentially admitting there was a lack in judgement or a potential wrongdoing by the Bidens during the Obama administration.

If Biden were to say “Yes, Hunter could continue to serve,” then Biden is sticking by the narrative that the Bidens did nothing wrong while serving in the Obama administration.

On the other hand, answering “yes” to this question, runs counter to the anti-corruption and anti-establishment narrative driving other front-runners like Warren and Sanders.

2. For Warren: Your plan for Native American and indigenous people calls on the government to respect these groups more. How can you do that as President after falsely identifying yourself as Native American?

On Columbus Day, Warren tweeted out her support for #IndigenousPeoplesDay and support of the Native American communities.

The story of America’s mistreatment of indigenous peoples is long and painful. And yet, Native communities have proven resilient. We owe them our respect—and we must honor our government's commitments and promises to them. #IndigenousPeoplesDay — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 14, 2019

Earlier this year, Warren took a DNA test to prove that she was Native American, a minority status that helped her land a job at Harvard. Her results showed she was only 1/1,024% Native American. This led the leader of the Cherokee tribe condemning Warren for her false claims. Warren apologized, but in the cancel culture we live in today, why is Warren’s apology acceptable? Why does the media give her a pass about lying about her relationship with these tribes?

Warren “has a plan” for upholding respect for Native Americans and indigenous people, but how can she represent these groups that have condemned her? This is an answer voters deserve.

3. For Sanders: After suffering a heart attack, how can you assure voters you are physically fit for the Office of the President?

At the beginning of the month, Sanders suffered a heart attack and underwent an emergency operation to insert two stents. Since his heart attack, Sanders announced he will slow his campaign down. At the age of 78, few have questioned Sanders’ health and stamina until this month. Instead, those questions and criticisms have been thrown to 76-year-old Biden.

With age and a heart attack taken into account, it is important that voters find reassurance from Sanders regarding his physical ability to hold the highest office in the land.

While the question may appear insensitive, it is an important reassurance that voters will need if he wants to prevent his base from moving towards Warren.

The debate is on Tuesday, October 15 at 8:00 PM on CNN, and can be watched online at CNN.com, NYTimes.com, via the CNN or New York Times apps, or through live YouTube streams.

Deterring Chinese Military Ambitions Before It’s Too Late,"From 2010 to 2012, at least 30—and probably many more—Chinese nationals working as spies for the Central Intelligence Agency in China were systematically identified and either jailed or slaughtered thanks to the CIA’s gross underestimation of Chinese intelligence cyber capabilities. Jerry Lee, a former CIA operations officer turned Chinese double agent (where have we heard this before?), as the FBI belatedly discovered, was walking around with a bunch of Chinese CIA agents’ real names written down in a notebook.

As national security journalist Bill Gertz verifies in his latest book Deceiving the Sky: Inside Communist China’s Drive for Global Supremacy, this information led to the network rollup by a task force comprised of the Chinese Ministry of State Security, the People’s Liberation Army’s cyber-warfare force then known as 3PLA, and other PLA intelligence entities.

The MSS was able to completely destroy the CIA’s networks in China through a combination of Lee’s agent details and the communications system breach. . . . At least three of the estimated thirty recruited Chinese agents were killed, including one who was summarily executed with a bullet to the head in front of his colleagues in the courtyard of a Chinese government building in a blunt warning to others not to work for American intelligence.

Lee was convicted of spying for China in April 2019. Lee’s treason, combined with the compromised CIA agent communications system, led to the wipeout of CIA human intelligence gathering in China for years, probably decades, to come. For decades prior, the U.S. establishment had a problem in even conceiving of the threat.

Joseph Nye. . . at Harvard University. . . led the academic community and their cousins in the US policy and intelligence communities, who put forth the noxious argument called the self-fulfilling prophecy toward China. Call out China, he argued, for its quasi-totalitarian communist system, its support for rogue states, its human rights abuses, and its use of lies and deception that are the main feature of that system, and the world will create a China threat.

Unfortunately for the disciples of Nye, the Chinese Communist Party, and the country enslaved to it, is not a friend to democracy, free markets, or the rule of law, and never will be. It is a belligerent mafia, riven by infighting, and controlled by a murderous don in People’s Republic President Xi Jinping.

Gertz draws on example after example taken from the past 15 years both from his journalistic experience and from heavily substantiated reporting by others to catalog a comprehensive history of Chinese aggression and perfidy that hammers this point home. China views the United States as its enemy.

The PLA vs. The People

Gertz argues that the CCP is clearly still in command of the country. Its philosophy has not mutated into a hoped-for benign strain of socialism, and it retains the goal of global domination and the ultimate destruction of its rivals in the West, most particularly the United States of America. That doesn’t mean the Chinese people necessarily go along.

For a delightful and often appalling account of how ordinary Chinese people interact with the regime, check out Federalist senior contributor Helen Raleigh’s memoir of growing up in China, Confucius Never Said. Indoctrination starts early. Raleigh recounts this harrowing fact of young life in the PRC:

Chinese elementary schools required their students to become members of the Young Pioneers group by the time they graduated. . . . What was going on in the school was a miniature reflection of what was going on in the society in large. For example, your teacher would check what class categories your parents were. The privileged few youngsters who became YPC members in first grade were normally sons and daughters of the red classes such as Communist Party members or factory workers. Some teachers would accept bribes from parents in exchange for helping their children become Pioneers first, and some teachers made sure their own children were included in the first batch.

The People’s Liberation Army is not an army of the Chinese people, Gertz reminds us in Deceiving the Sky, but an army owned lock, stock, and barrel by the Chinese Communist Party. Xi’s purges of PLA flag and staff officers deemed politically untrustworthy is a reminder of just who is in charge of this warmaking machine.

The recent blockbuster movie Operation Red Sea directed by John Woo disciple and Hong Kong-based filmmaker Dante Lam inadvertently makes this case. The film, which depicts PLA Navy Marines rescuing Chinese hostages in Yemen, is masterful, with beautifully brutal action sequences, impeccable acting from the principals, and great storytelling chops. But the film was mostly funded by the PLA and used what seem like a bottomless supply of PLA and PLAN military assets, from state-of-the-art NODs to PLAN aircraft carriers.

Tacked on to the end of the movie is an amazing wide shot of a PLAN battle group sailing through the South China Sea with an ominous voice-over announcer declaring that these waters belong to China and all others must stay away. Perhaps Lam will come to regret his Leni-Riefenstahl-like contribution should PLA tanks come rolling through Victoria Park in Hong Kong in the future.

Asymmetric Warfare

In 1993, the Chinese military establishment was awed by the U.S. military’s performance in Desert Storm and decided it was in a bad spot if it ever wanted to beat the United States in a war. An important internal report argued that the PLA needed to develop asymmetrical weapons and methods of fighting to achieve its ultimate goal, defeat of the United States and global hegemony for the Communist Party.

The asymmetrical attack is based on the old Chinese idea of the Assassin’s Mace, says Gertz—that is, a weapon that takes advantages of specific vulnerabilities when one is up against a powerful enemy. The biggest Assassin’s Mace China possesses, argues Gertz, is its antisatellite capabilities. China announced its ASAT ambitions in 2007, when the PLA blew up one of its own satellites in space with a missile. This left a dangerous debris ring in orbit around the Earth that’s still causing problems.

Since then, the PLA Space Corps (unlike the United States, China takes a military space force deadly seriously) has been refining its ASAT capabilities with not only antisatellite missiles, but robotic attack arms on its satellites, and powerful lasers capable of disabling U.S. and other satellites (and blinding U.S. soldiers on Earth, which it probably did in 2018 to a C-130 crewman flying a surveillance mission out of Camp Lemonnier at the Horn of Africa). China no longer depends on the U.S. GPS system, but has developed its own global positioning network of more than 20 satellites called the Beidou system.

All of this activity exploits a deep vulnerability of the U.S. military: It has no dedicated antisatellite weapons. The best the United States can do is send up a modified ballistic missile to take out a low-orbit satellite, which it has done exactly once in its history. Where are the U.S. ASAT missiles? The last one was produced in 1988. You can visit it at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum Udvar-Hazy Center near Dulles Airport. INERT is stenciled in big letters on the rocket tube—which may as well be an epitaph for the entire U.S. ASAT program.

Another asymmetric Assassin’s Mace weapon is cyber warfare. Gertz gives stunning details on Chinese hacking capabilities, and the huge trove of U.S. military and military contractor information they have stolen from the United States. The PLA Xian Y-20 cargo plane is a copy almost down to the nuts and bolts of the U.S. heavy transport C-17, and was based on plans the PLA cyber division 3PLA sucked from Boeing’s computers.

Gertz reports that 3PLA has also stolen highly detailed information on the F-35, America’s preeminent stealth fighter jet. Not only does this represent tens of billions of dollars stolen from U.S. taxpayers and decades of labor taken from American scientists and engineers, the F-35 fleet is the crown jewels of the U.S. defense capability. China has now cloned the F-35 as the Chinese J-20.

Perhaps the greatest effect of PRC aggression and failed U.S. China policy is the fact that China has stolen plans for at least six U.S. nuclear weapons, says Gertz. These include the W-88 warhead used on the sub-launched Trident missile. Any attack by these weapons might result in millions of American deaths.

Deceiving the Sky details a great many other Chinese technological advances based on intellectual property theft and the one case of Chinese creative initiative—the quantum encryption technology that is becoming commonplace in CCP and PLA command and control networks that prevent the National Security Agency from eavesdropping.

Cultural and Financial Warfare

What’s most revelatory in Deceiving the Sky is Gertz’s account of China’s ongoing cultural and financial warfare against the United States. From Clinton to Bush to Obama, the reigning diplomatic philosophy when dealing with China has been that unfettered trade and engagement with the Chinese government is a good thing. Gertz argues that the Chinese communists have played the U.S. political establishment like a fiddle. He documents that, for many years, it was career suicide for U.S. military, intelligence, and diplomatic professionals to call out Chinese deceit and aggressive behavior in general.

Gertz gives as an example the defenestration of Navy Capt. James Fanell, a former Pacific Fleet intelligence director, who was forced to retire from the Navy over a trumped-up security violation. “His ouster was widely viewed as political retaliation for the stark comments about the Chinese military that had angered pro-China officials in the Navy and the Obama administration,” Gertz says.

Many, if not most, of the 300,000 Chinese foreign exchange students in the United States are under the thumb of the Ministry of State Security, says Gertz, and are expected to not only report back information the regime might find useful but, in some cases, to actively seek it out. Even more worrying, Gertz claims, the U.S. financial system is wide open for Chinese exploitation.

Chinese investors rely heavily on what appears to be a legal loophole in US regulations known as Regulation S. The rule is based on the concept of international comity. It allows Chinese companies to issue US dollar-denominated bonds on overseas exchanges that can subsequently be held in fixed-income portfolios of American investors through several mechanisms.

This put the IRAs and pension funds of ordinary Americans at risk for Chinese manipulation. Plus, Western financial markets are, in effect, financing the rapid build-up of the PLA.

In March 2018, China Shipbuilding announced plans to build the PLA Navy’s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to bolster two other conventionally powered carriers . . . soon after the announcement, China Shipbuilding issued a $1 billion bond in the German bond market in Frankfurt. The bond had a maturity date and an amount that coincided with the expected completion date of the nuclear-powered carrier. . . . some of the bond proceeds were provided by institutional US investors. That, in turn, means that average American’s investment portfolio is being used to fund Beijing’s military buildup.

The idea that China wants new weapons for defense is pure fantasy. No nation on planet Earth is looking to attack China, least of all the United States. As Gertz documents, the CCP and PLA are militantly paranoid organizations where aggressive manipulation is rewarded and a system of “party princelings”—descendants of earlier party members—jockey for position. A deep hatred for the United States and the West permeates this establishment and finds justification in a century of virulent anti-American CCP propaganda.

The People’s Republic of China is an aggressor state. It is looking to swallow Hong Kong, annex Taiwan, claim Japan’s Senkaku Islands (suspected to harbor oil resources; China, as big as it is, has almost no oil or natural gas production), and claim suzerainty of the entire South China Sea via its system of artificial atoll bases. Its ultimate objective, Gertz claims, is not the well-being of the Chinese people, but the expansion of the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP sees this as its destiny.

A Doctrine of Deterrence

Gertz’s argument is powerful, but at times attenuated by a reportorial mushiness in the narrative that is likely unavoidable in a work that is so heavily fact-based. Gertz also includes a couple of interesting science fiction scenarios for how the start of World War III (or IV, depending on how you look at it) might play out.

Gertz’s allegiance is as clear as his facts are impossible to discount. He offers several prescriptions for remedying the crisis. The first is to take counterintelligence seriously by establishing an agency separate from FBI, CIA, and the DOD’s various entities to handle it.

He further argues that the U.S. military needs to develop doctrinal war plans and let the PLA know basically what they entail. They should include a devastating counterattack on the top leadership of both the CCP and the PLA in their Beijing burrows such as the CCP’s Zhongnanhai headquarters and the Western Hills underground command center. The purpose would be to assure the PLA and CCP that they will be obliterated if they start a war with the United States.

A doctrine of deterrence would also bear fruits in current areas of tension such as the PLA’s aggressive expansion in the South China Sea, and the CCP’s fever dream of one day conquering Taiwan. It might even give Hong Kong a fighting chance at freedom over the long haul.

The United States may be a nation in turmoil, but it is hardly a nation in decline. A response similar to what Gertz outlines will eventually be put in place, since U.S. national survival demands it. And if the U.S. security establishment listens to Gertz sooner rather than later, much American gold and blood may be spared as the nation copes with an enemy that so obviously and completely wishes it dead, dead, dead.

"Sending 3,000 To Saudi Arabia Is Not 'Bringing Our Soldiers Back Home'","Washington is sending roughly 3,000 troops along with increased weapons aid to Saudi Arabia to counter Iran, the Pentagon announced last week. While then-Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford said in late September it was “fair to say not thousands” of Americans would be deployed to defend Saudi Arabia, it is now clear “thousands” is exactly the right term.

The pretext for putting U.S. troops on the ground in Saudi Arabia is a mid-September drone attack on key Saudi oil infrastructure, likely originating from Iran. But President Trump and his Pentagon are making a big mistake.

Putting U.S. boots on the ground in Saudi Arabia is the opposite of the “America First” foreign policy Trump promised on the campaign trail. It is the opposite of his justification on Wednesday for pulling troops from Syria: “It’s their part of the world. We’re 7,000 miles away. I campaigned on bringing our soldiers back home, and that’s what I’m doing.”

Saudi Arabia Can Protect Its Own Oil Infrastructure

First, the United States has no business placing its soldiers in harm’s way to protect Saudi oil infrastructure. Saudi Arabia is perfectly capable of defending this infrastructure itself, and the claim that defending this infrastructure serves U.S. interests doesn’t hold up to scrutiny.

That thinking completely ignores the reality of the last 10 years: The United States has seen a tremendous increase in domestic oil production, is sitting on more oil than any other nation on earth, is closing in on energy independence, and is now a net exporter of crude. The nature of oil production in America has changed as well — hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, coupled with America’s deep capital markets and private property rights, allows American producers to respond quickly to increases in price.

Right after the Saudi drone attack, many wanted to say the U.S. energy independence narrative — which holds that the United States could afford to be less involved in the Middle East — was “up in smoke.” But while the attack on Saudi infrastructure caused oil prices to spike over fears of a sharp decline in Saudi crude output, oil prices soon moved even lower than before the attack.

A large reason for this was that the damage wasn’t as bad as was initially feared. Another reason is that U.S. swing-producers in the Permian Basin are ready to make up for lost Saudi output, which is already in secular decline. Because of growing American energy independence, we don’t need to fight for Saudi oil.

Others have argued the United States needs to support Saudi Arabia militarily to ensure Saudi Arabia keeps pricing its oil in dollars, which supports the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. If keeping the reserve currency is a concern, Washington should conserve its sanctions power, as ending the overuse of sanctions power is the low-hanging fruit in this regard.

Although reserve currency status gives Washington great power, there is evidence that the dollar’s status as the singular reserve for global central banks has harmed many American workers, especially manufacturing workers. Supporting the dollar isn’t worth the cost of subverting U.S. foreign policy to Saudi Arabia.

Troops in Saudi Arabia Heightens Conflict With Iran

Second, the United States shouldn’t side with Saudi Arabia in its de facto war with Iran, which is an outgrowth of the 1,400-year-old Sunni-Shia conflict within Islam. Saudi Arabia is only an occasional partner with the United States. It is not an ally like Israel, the United Kingdom, or France, and the value of its partnership is often dubious.

The Saudi regime has funded radical Sunni groups affiliated with al Qaeda, and elements of the Saudi government aided the 9/11 hijackers. And while the Washington foreign policy establishment rarely mentions the Saudis’ flagrant human rights abuses, they are no less real than the Chinese abuses that are more frequently and correctly criticized.

Iran is an adversary, of course, but putting our troops on Saudi soil will have the unintended consequence of encouraging the Saudi government to take more aggressive action toward Iran. That risks destabilizing the Middle East even further, and it puts American soldiers increasingly in harm’s way if Iran responds to the Saudis.

And if American soldiers are killed, a broader war is almost certain. Already, last week, Iran claimed one of its oil tankers was hit by missiles. This pushed oil higher, almost to where it was before the September attack on Saudi infrastructure.

Removing Troops From Saudi Arabia Will Be Difficult

Finally, once America puts troops on foreign soil, it is incredibly hard to remove them. In Washington, the path of least resistance is always to add more troops, while those who wish to exit decades-long entanglements are accused of enabling terror, threatening U.S. security, and even being disloyal to the country.

We’re seeing this in Syria right now. Initially, the White House moved several hundred American soldiers away from Syria’s border with Turkey. This relatively minor reshuffling resulted in Republicans, Democrats, and the media lambasting the Trump administration for daring to withdraw troops. Now, the administration is removing 1,000 from northern Syria, and the criticism is only getting louder.

The backdrop is that Turkey has wanted to invade Syria for some time, as it has a sizable Kurdish minority in southeastern Syria, and it fears Kurdish forces across its border with Syria. The onslaught the Kurds face is awful, and they will have to work with the Syrian government to fight the Turkish incursion.

But arguing that the United States should have kept those several hundred troops on the ground to act as human shields for the Kurds ignores the lessons of the last two decades of foreign policy failure in the Middle East. Imprudently delaying our exit from Syria after defeating the Islamic State is why we faced only two choices in Syria: (1) stay forever and risk war with Turkey, or (2) abandon the Kurds.

Trump was right to challenge the foreign policy status quo in Syria. He’s wrong to create a similar future problem by placing troops in Saudi Arabia.

How The Obama Administration Set In Motion Its Coup Against Trump,"The following is an excerpt from Lee Smith’s book out October 29, “The Plot Against the President: The True Story of How Congressman Devin Nunes Uncovered the Biggest Political Scandal in U.S. History.”

AFTER DONALD TRUMP was elected forty-fifth president of the United States, the operation designed to undermine his campaign transformed. It became an instrument to bring down the commander in chief. The coup started almost immediately after the polls closed.

Hillary Clinton’s communications team decided within twenty-four hours of her concession speech to message that the election was illegitimate, that Russia had interfered to help Trump.

Obama was working against Trump until the hour he left office. His national security advisor, Susan Rice, commemorated it with an email to herself on January 20, moments before Trump’s inauguration. She wrote to memorialize a meeting in the White House two weeks before.

On January 5, following a briefing by IC leadership on Russian hacking during the 2016 Presidential election, President Obama had a brief follow-on conversation with FBI Director Jim Comey and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates in the Oval Office. Vice President Biden and I were also present. President Obama began the conversation by stressing his continued commitment to ensuring that every aspect of this issue is handled by the Intelligence and law enforcement communities “by the book.” The President stressed that he is not asking about, initiating or instructing anything from a law enforcement perspective. He reiterated that our law enforcement team needs to proceed as it normally would by the book. From a national security perspective, however, President Obama said he wants to be sure that, as we engage with the incoming team, we are mindful to ascertain if there is any reason that we cannot share information fully as it relates to Russia. . . . The President asked Comey to inform him if anything changes in the next few weeks that should affect how we share classified information with the incoming team. Comey said he would.

The repetition of “by the book” gave away the game—for there was nothing normal about any of it.

Rice wrote an email to herself. It commemorated a conversation from two weeks before. The conversation was about the FBI’s investigation of the man who was about to move into the White House—an investigation from which Obama was careful to distance himself. During the conversation, the outgoing president instructed his top aides to collect information (“ascertain”) regarding the incoming administration’s relationship with Russia.

“To any rational person,” says Nunes, “it looks like they were scheming to produce a get-out-of-jail-free card—for the president and anyone else in the White House. They were playing Monopoly while the others were playing with fire. Now the Obama White House was in the clear—sure, they had no idea what Comey and Brennan and McCabe and Strzok and the rest were up to.”

Boxing Trump in on Russia

Meanwhile, Obama added his voice to the Trump-Russia echo chamber as news stories alleging Trump’s illicit relationship with the Kremlin multiplied in the transition period. He said he hoped “that the president-elect also is willing to stand up to Russia.”

The outgoing president was in Germany with Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss everything from NATO to Vladimir Putin. Obama said that he’d “delivered a clear and forceful message” to the Russian president about “meddling with elections . . . and we will respond appropriately if and when we see this happening.”

After refusing to act while the Russian election meddling was actually occurring, Obama responded in December. He ordered the closing of Russian diplomatic facilities and the expulsion of thirty- five Russian diplomats. The response was tepid. The Russians had hacked the State Department in 2014 and the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2015. And now Obama was responding only on his way out.

Even Obama partisans thought it was weak. “The punishment did not fit the crime,” said Michael McFaul, Obama’s former ambassador to Russia. “The Kremlin should have paid a much higher price for that attack.”

But the administration wasn’t retaliating against Russia for interfering in a US election; the action was directed at Trump. Obama was leaving the president-elect with a minor foreign policy crisis in order to box him in. Any criticism of Obama’s response, never mind an attempt to reverse it, would only further fuel press reports that Trump was collaborating with the Russians.

Spreading Intelligence to Spring Leaks

In the administration’s last days, it disseminated intelligence throughout the government, including the White House, Capitol Hill, and the intelligence community (IC). Intelligence was classified at the lowest possible levels to ensure a wide readership. The White House was paving the way for a campaign of leaks to disorient the incoming Trump team.

The effort, including the intended result of leaks, was publicly acknowledged in March 2017 by Evelyn Farkas, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration.

Obama’s biggest move against Trump was to order CIA director John Brennan to conduct a full review of all intelligence relating to Russia and the 2016 elections. He requested it on December 6 and wanted it ready by the time he left office on January 20. But the sitting president already knew what the intelligence community assessment (ICA) was going to say, because Brennan had told him months before.

Brennan’s handpicked team of CIA, FBI, and NSA analysts had started analyzing Russian election interference in late July. In August, Brennan had briefed Harry Reid on the dossier and may have briefed Obama on it, too. Earlier in August, Brennan sent a “bombshell” report to Obama’s desk.

When Brennan reassembled his select team in December, it was to have them reproduce their August findings: Putin, according to Brennan, was boosting the GOP candidate. And that’s why only three days after Obama ordered the assessment in December, the Washington Post could already reveal what the intelligence community had found.

“The CIA,” reported the December 9 edition of the Post, “has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system.”

The story was the first of many apparently sourced to leaks of classified information that were given to the Post team of Adam Entous, Ellen Nakashima, and Greg Miller. The reporters’ sources weren’t whistle-blowers shedding light on government corruption— rather, they were senior US officials abusing government resources to prosecute a campaign against the newly elected commander in chief. The article was the earliest public evidence that the coup was under way. The floodgates were open, as the IC pushed more stories through the press to delegitimize the president-elect.

A Wave of Leak-Sourced Stories All Saying the Same Thing

The same day, a New York Times article by David E. Sanger and Scott Shane echoed the Post’s piece. According to senior administration officials, “American intelligence agencies have concluded with ‘high confidence’ that Russia acted covertly in the latter stages of the presidential campaign to harm Hillary Clinton’s chances and promote Donald J. Trump.”

A December 14 NBC News story by William M. Arkin, Ken Dilanian, and Cynthia McFadden reported that “Russian President Vladimir Putin became personally involved in the covert Russian campaign to interfere in the U.S. presidential election, senior U.S. intelligence officials told NBC News.”

The ICA that Obama ordered gave political operatives, the press, and his intelligence chiefs a second shot at Trump. They’d used the Steele Dossier to feed the echo chamber and obtain surveillance powers to spy on the Trump campaign. The dossier, however, had come up short. Trump had won.

But now, on his way out of the White House, Obama instructed Brennan to stamp the CIA’s imprimatur on the anti-Trump operation. As Fusion GPS’s smear campaign had been the source of the preelection press campaign, the ICA was the basis of the postelection media frenzy. It was tailored to disrupt the peaceful transition of power and throw the United States into chaos.

Because Trump hadn’t been elected by the US public, according to the ICA, but had been tapped by Putin, he was illegitimate. Therefore, the extraconstitutional and illegal tactics employed by anti-Trump officials were legitimate. The ultimate goal was to remove Trump from office.

“If it weren’t for President Obama,” said James Clapper, “we might not have done the intelligence community assessment . . . that set off a whole sequence of events which are still unfolding today.”

Nunes agrees. “The ICA,” he says, “was Obama’s dossier.”

Changing the Intelligence Assessment

Nunes is sitting in his office in the Longworth House Office Building along with his communications director, Jack Langer, a forty-six-year-old former book editor and historian with a PhD from Duke University.

“The social media attacks on Devin began shortly after the election,” Langer remembers. “They’re all hinting at some vast conspiracy involving Russia that the chairman of the Intelligence Committee is part of. And we have no idea what they’re talking about.”

Nunes points out that his warnings about Russia fell on deaf ears for years. “And all of a sudden I’m a Russian agent,” says the congressman.

Now Langer and Nunes see that the attacks were first launched because the congressman had been named to Trump’s transition team. “I put forward [Mike] Pompeo for CIA director,” says Nunes. “He came from our committee.”

The attacks on Nunes picked up after the December 9 Washington Post article. The assessment provided there was not what the HPSCI chairman had been told. The assessment had been altered, and Nunes asked for an explanation. “We got briefed about the election around Thanksgiving,” he says. “And it’s just the usual stuff, nothing abnormal. They told us what everyone already knew: ‘Hey, the Russians are bad actors, and they’re always playing games, and here’s what they did.’”

By providing that briefing, the IC had made a mistake. When it later changed the assessment, the November briefing was evidence that Obama’s spy chiefs were up to no good. “I bet they’d like to have that back,” says Nunes. “They briefed us before they could get their new story straight.”

‘They Kept Everyone Else Away from It’

Nunes acknowledges that he was caught off guard by many things back then. “We still thought these guys were on the up and up,” he says. “But if we knew, we’d have nailed them by mid-December, when they changed their assessment. ‘Wait, you guys are saying this now, but you said something else just a few weeks ago. What’s going on?’”

After the Post story, Nunes wanted an explanation. “We expressed deep concern, both publicly and privately,” says Langer. “We demanded our own briefing to try to determine whether that Post story was true or false. They refused to brief us. They said, ‘We’re not going to be doing that until we finish the ICA.’”

Nunes says the fact that the IC conducted an assessment like that was itself unusual. “I don’t know how many times they’d done that in the past, if ever,” he says. “But if the IC is operating properly, when someone says what can you tell me on X or Y or Z, they have it ready to pull up quickly. The tradecraft is reliable, and the intelligence products are reliable.” That was not the case with the ICA. There were problems with how the assessment had been put together.

“If you really were going to do something like an assessment from the intelligence community, then you’d get input from all our seventeen agencies,” says Nunes. “They did the opposite. It was only FBI, CIA, NSA, and DNI. They siloed it, just like they had with Crossfire Hurricane. They kept everyone else away from it so they didn’t have to read them in.”

‘Manipulation of Intelligence for Political Purposes’

Nunes released several statements in the middle of December. The HPSCI majority, read a December 14 statement, wanted senior Obama intelligence officials “to clarify press reports that the CIA has a new assessment that it has not shared with us. The Committee is deeply concerned that intransigence in sharing intelligence with Congress can enable the manipulation of intelligence for political purposes.”

After the statements warned of political foul play in the IC’s assessments, the social media attacks on Nunes became more regular. “They were constant,” says Langer.

Anti-Trump operatives recognized that Nunes was going to be a problem. The HPSCI chair had previously called out the IC for politicizing intelligence. “They said that we had defeated Al Qaeda in Iraq and Syria,” says Nunes, “and I knew that wasn’t true. Then they withheld the Osama bin Laden documents to conceal that Al Qaeda worked with Iran, because the administration was protecting the Iran deal. So when I saw them changing this assessment of the 2016 election in midstream, I knew it was the same old trick: they were politicizing intelligence.”

The speed with which Brennan’s handpicked analysts produced the ICA and then got a version of it declassified for public consumption was another sign that something wasn’t right. “All throughout Obama’s two terms, his IC chiefs aren’t paying attention to Russian actions,” says Nunes. “We give them more money for Russia, which they don’t use. But now they know so much about Putin that they manage to produce a comprehensive assessment of Russian intentions and actions regarding election interference in a month—at Christmastime, when everything slows down. And then they produce a declassified version in a manner of weeks. None of this is believable.”

Three different versions of the ICA were produced: an unclassified version, a top secret one, and another highly compartmentalized version. According to a January 11, 2017, Washington Post story by Greg Miller, Ellen Nakashima, and Karen DeYoung, an annex summarizing the dossier was attached to the versions that were not declassified.

‘Designed to Have a Political Effect’

The FBI had been working from Steele’s reports for more than half a year. Including the dossier along with the ICA would provide Comey with ammunition to take on the president-elect. Both he and Brennan were manipulating intelligence for political purposes.

“A lot of the ICA is reasonable,” says Nunes. “But those parts become irrelevant due to the problematic parts, which undermine the entire document. It was designed to have a political effect; that was the ICA’s sole purpose.”

The assessment’s methodological flaws are not difficult to spot. Manufacturing the politicized findings that Obama sought meant not only abandoning protocol but also subverting basic logic. Two of the ICA’s central findings are that:

Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.

Putin and the Russian government aspired to help President-elect Trump’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him.

To know preferences and intentions would require sources targeting Putin’s inner circles—either human sources or electronic surveillance. As Nunes had previously noted, however, US intelligence on Putin’s decision-making process was inadequate.

But even if there had been extensive collection on precisely that issue, it would be difficult to know what was true. For instance, the closest you can get to Putin’s inner circle is Putin himself. But even capturing him on an intercept saying he wanted to elect Trump might prove inconclusive. It is difficult to judge intentions because it is not possible to see into the minds of other people. How would you know that Putin was speaking truthfully? How would you know that the Russian president didn’t know his communications were under US surveillance and wasn’t trying to deceive his audience?

Quality control of information is one of the tasks of counterintelligence—to discern how you know what you know and whether that information is trustworthy. There was no quality control for the Trump-Russia intelligence. For instance, Crossfire Hurricane lead agent Peter Strzok was the FBI’s deputy assistant director of counterintelligence. Instead of weeding out flawed intelligence on Russia, the Crossfire Hurricane team was feeding Steele’s reports into intelligence products. Yet the ICA claimed to have “high confidence” in its assessment that “Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President- elect Trump.” What was the basis of that judgment?

According to the ICA:

Putin most likely wanted to discredit Secretary Clinton because he has publicly blamed her since 2011 for inciting mass protests against his regime in late 2011 and early 2012, and because he holds a grudge for comments he almost certainly saw as disparaging him.

“Most likely” and “almost certainly” are rhetorical hedges that show the assessment could not have been made in “high confidence.” Putin may have held a grudge against Clinton, but there is no way of knowing it.

The supporting evidence deteriorates more the farther the ICA purports to reach into Putin’s mind.

Beginning in June, Putin’s public comments about the US presidential race avoided directly praising President-elect Trump, probably because Kremlin officials thought that any praise from Putin personally would backfire in the United States.

This is absurd. Part of the evidence that Putin supported Trump is that he avoided praising Trump. It is difficult enough to determine intentions by what someone says. Yet the ICA claims to have discerned Putin’s intentions by what he did not say.

There is no introductory philosophy class in logic where reasoning like that would pass muster. Yet Brennan’s handpicked group used it as the basis of its assessment that Putin had helped Trump.

Moscow also saw the election of President-elect Trump as a way to achieve an international counterterrorism coalition against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.

This may be an accurate description of how Putin saw Trump. But Trump’s predecessor also wanted to coordinate anti- ISIS operations with Moscow. On this view, Trump would have represented a continuation of Obama’s ISIS policy. Why would this make Trump’s victory suspicious to Obama’s intelligence chiefs?

Curious Inaccuracies about Russia’s RT Network

The ICA also pointed to documentary evidence of Putin’s intentions: English-language media owned by the Russian government, the news site Sputnik, and the RT network, were critical of Clinton.

State-owned Russian media made increasingly favorable comments about President-elect Trump as the 2016 US general and primary election campaigns progressed while consistently offering negative coverage of Secretary Clinton.

Curiously, just days before the election, the informant the US government sent after the Trump campaign praised the Democratic candidate in an interview with Sputnik. “Clinton would be best for US-UK relations and for relations with the European Union,” Stefan Halper told the Kremlin-directed media outlet. “Clinton is well-known, deeply experienced, and predictable. US-UK relations will remain steady regardless of the winner although Clinton will be less disruptive over time.”

The ICA includes a seven-page appendix devoted to RT, the central node, according to the document, of the Kremlin’s effort to “influence politics, fuel discontent in [sic] US.”

Adam Schiff appeared on RT in July 2013. He argued for “making the FISA court much more transparent, so the American people can understand what’s being done in their name in the name of national security, so that we can have a more informed debate over the balance between privacy and security.”

RT’s editor in chief, Margarita Simonyan, is a master propagandist, according to the ICA. The document fails to mention that Simonyan heads another Moscow-owned media initiative, Russia Beyond the Headlines, a news supplement inserted into dozens of the West’s leading newspapers, including the New York Times. Russia Beyond the Headlines has been delivered to millions of American homes over the last decade. By contrast, RT’s US market share is so small that it doesn’t qualify for the Nielsen ratings. Virtually no one in the United States watches it.

Taking the logic of Brennan’s handpicked team seriously would mean that the publishers of the New York Times played a major role in a coordinated Russian effort to elect Donald Trump.

‘It Was an Operation to Bring Down Trump’

Nunes realized even then the purpose of Obama’s dossier. “Devin figured out in December what was going on,” says Langer. “It was an operation to bring down Trump.”

There was no evidence that any Trump associate had done anything improper regarding the Russians, and Nunes was losing patience. “We had serious things the committee wanted to do,” he says. “With Trump elected, we could do some big stuff, like with China.”

Still, it was important for HPSCI to maintain control of the Russia investigation. Otherwise, Democrats and Never Trump Republicans were likely to get their wish to convene a bipartisan commission to investigate Russian interference—with the purpose of turning it on Trump.

“Before they started floating the idea of a special counsel, the big idea was a special commission like the 9/11 Commission,” says Langer. It was outgoing secretary of state John Kerry who first came forward with the proposal.

The point was to change the power dynamic. “In a normal committee,” says Langer, “the majority has the power, and that happened to be us. They wanted to strip our power and make it fifty-fifty.”

“Bipartisan” was a euphemism for “anti-Trump.” “It would have been a complete joke,” says Nunes. “A combination of partisan hacks from the left and people who hated Trump on the right.”

Democrats led by Schiff and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer were joined by the late John McCain, the most active of the Never Trump Republicans. After the election, the Arizona senator had instructed his aide David Kramer to deliver a copy of the Steele Dossier to Comey.

“God only knows who they’d have populated that committee with,” says Nunes. “Anyone they could control. It would have been a freak show.”

Speaker of the House Paul Ryan defended HPSCI’s independence. On the Senate side, Intelligence Committee chairman Richard Burr had only one move. To deflect demands for an independent commission, he effectively ceded control of the Senate investigation to his vice chair, Democrat Mark Warner.

No Evidence of Collusion Years Later

Still, Nunes believed that all the talk of Trump and Russia was a waste of time. “They kept promising us evidence of collusion, week after week, and they came up with nothing.”

Nunes’s disdain for the ICA forced the Crossfire Hurricane team’s hand. “Right around the time that they came out with the ICA, they kept saying that we were waiting on something to show us, something important that was coming in,” he says. “They said it was some significant figure who they couldn’t quite track down yet.”

But the FBI knew exactly where its missing link was, the piece of evidence that they thought would convince hardened skeptics like Nunes that collusion was real. They didn’t have to chase him down, because he was sitting at home in Chicago. He submitted to a voluntary interview January 27 and without a lawyer because he had no idea what the FBI had in store for him.

The Crossfire Hurricane team was figuring how they were going to set up the Trump adviser they’d used to open up the investigation in July 2016: George Papadopoulos.

What We Know About The Slaughter Of An American Family In Mexico,"Early Monday morning, three mothers traveling with 14 children between them were ambushed and gunned down in Mexico by drug cartel members near the United States Arizona border. Here’s what we know so far:

1. One car was shot until it exploded and caught on fire.

Rhonita Miller and four of her seven children were shot in their car, which then exploded and caught on fire. Their remains were burned to ashes except for a few bones, enough to identity all five of them were in the vehicle.

State authorities said more than 200 bullet casings were found near the vehicles.

2. Mother Christina Langford Johnson jumped out of her car to plead with cartel.

Christina Langford Johnson, 31, allegedly jumped out of her vehicle as the attackers shot from the road ahead, waving her arms in an attempt to let the cartel know it was innocent women and children in the vehicles.

“They shot her anyway,” said Lenzo Widmar, a cousin of the victims. “They knew it was women and children.”

3. A 13-year-old boy survivor walked six hours for help.

Devin Langford, the second oldest of the the nine Langford children who were traveling with their mother, Dawna Ray Langford, hid his surviving siblings under branches in nearby bushes before leaving to find help. Devin walked 14 miles back to La Mora, where he arrived at 5:30 p.m. delivering news of the deadly attack.

The oldest Langford sibling, 14-year-old Kylie Evelyn Langford, was shot in the foot and stayed with the younger siblings. When Devin didn’t return quickly, Kylie sent 9-year-old Mckenzie Rayne Langford to search for help. After two hours of looking, a search party composed of family members and Mexican officials found Kylie late Monday evening.

4. The 7-month-old baby miraculously survived in a strategically placed car seat.

Faith Marie Johnson, 7 months old, was found alive and unscathed in a vehicle riddled with bullet holes. Her car seat had been placed on the floor of the vehicle, presumably moved by her mother for protection.

“When they started shooting, she ducked down and put the baby behind the seat,” Kenny LeBaron, a cousin, told the Washington Post. “I think it was a miracle.”

4. It’s unclear whether the attack was targeted or not.

Cousin Lenzo Widmar told the Washington Post that many cartel rivals have been fighting in the area recently, but have directed no recent threats at their community in La Mora.

A family friend who created a GoFundMe page for the family said, “We are a community of US citizens that live and operate between Mexico and the United States we are under attack as we speak by the cartels in Mexico.”

Some reports have tied the murders to the family’s history of run-ins with the cartel, including the 2009 kidnapping of 16-year-old Eric LeBaron. Still, other relatives have told reporters they believe the attacks were a case of mistaken identity by drug cartel gunmen and commented on the oddity of an attack in broad daylight. No suspects or motives have been publicly named.

5. Mexican President Obrador resists reacting with force.

After President Trump tweeted at Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador that U.S. troops were standing by to take down the cartel, Obrador thanked Trump but said pursuing the criminals was “a matter of sovereignty” for Mexico.

“We don’t think that by opening fire, massacring, using force, blood, and fire, we will resolve this problem,” Obrador said at a press conference.

Sens. Mitt Romney and Mike Lee, both from Utah, have called on Obrador to ensure justice after the massacre.

Ann and I are heartbroken for the victims of the horrific attacks in Mexico. Our prayers are with their families who have suffered such an unspeakable tragedy. The U.S. must work with Mexican officials to hold accountable those responsible for this senseless violence. — Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) November 5, 2019",https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/06/heres-what-we-know-about-the-slaughter-of-an-american-family-in-mexico/,2019-11-06
"Sanders Doesn't Rule Out Warren For Vice President, Attacks Biden","2020 Democratic White House hopeful Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said he would consider Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren as a running mate. In the same interview, he criticized former Vice President Joe Biden on trade and foreign policy.

In an interview with the Intercept’s “Deconstructed” podcast published Thursday, the podcast host Mehdi Hasan asked Sanders pointblank whether he would consider putting Warren on the ticket.

“I would look absolutely to Elizabeth Warren as somebody who would play a very, very important role in everything that we’re doing,” Sanders said. The Vermont senator went on to praise his fellow left-wing progressive in the race for being an adamant supporter of his signature health care plan dubbed “Medicare for All.”

“I appreciate very much that Senator Warren is a strong supporter of Medicare for All, and is supporting the legislation I introduced which is the only way that we’re going to provide quality health care to all people in a cost-effective way,” Sanders said, but maintained that it was still too early to consider the number two ticket.

Sanders went on to pledge a diverse administration, repeating a popular line among Democrats in the primary in the age of identity politics, when touting diversity has become a mandatory practice.

“My cabinet will look like America. It will be the most diverse administration and most diverse cabinet this country has ever seen,” Sanders said. “We are proud of our diversity.”

The Vermont senator also criticized Biden, former vice president and senator from Delaware, for supporting the war in Iraq and advocating for legislation that Sanders considers cozying up to the nation’s wealthy.

“[Biden] was one of the leaders on this disastrous bankruptcy bill. He voted for these terrible trade agreements, NAFTA, PNTR with China, which cost us millions of good paying jobs,” Sanders chastised. “Joe was on the floor of the Senate talking about the need to cut back on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. So, you know, I think what you’re seeing is somebody who raises a while lot of money from the wealthy and the powerful, somebody who touts in many ways the corporate line.”

Sanders’ comments come as the 2016 progressive flag-bearer has seen new competition from Warren for his role in being the party’s anti-establishment socialist in the race. Warren and Sanders remained neck-and-neck in the polls for much of the summer with Warren breaking ahead in September to solidify a second-place status behind Biden in Real Clear Politics’ latest aggregate of polls.

In the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, Warren leads Sanders comfortably as Biden begins to see his frontrunner status sink in jeopardy while President Donald Trump’s impeachment keeps the Biden family’s shady business dealings with Ukraine in the spotlight.

Despite Warren’s success, the two progressive senators have avoided trading attacks on the campaign trail and have instead campaigned as allies, parrying off attacks on their left-wing proposals from the more relatively moderate candidates in primary debates.

Nationally, Warren holds just more than 21 percent support to Sanders’ approximately 18. Both trail Biden, who is ahead with nearly 29 percent in the Real Clear aggregate.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/07/bernie-sanders-attacks-biden-but-doesnt-rule-out-warren-for-vice-president-slot/,2019-11-07
Relatives Of Family Slain In Mexico Say Cartel Attack Was No Accident,"Two relatives of the LaBarron family in La Mora, Mexico told Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum the deadly attack killing nine U.S. dual citizens on Monday was planned, and that the cartel gunmen may have used the women and children as “bait” in a drug cartel territory war.

On Wednesday’s “The Story with Martha MacCallum,” relative Leah Staddon said the family believes the attack was intentional, not a case of hitting the wrong target, as some reports have suggested.

“All we know is that it was on purpose. It wasn’t an accident. They weren’t in the wrong place in the wrong time. We don’t believe that that’s the truth,” Staddon said.

Staddon, whose sister-in-law and cousin were two of the women drivers, said her nephew was in the second vehicle gunned down when he witnessed Christina Langford Johnson, 31, get out of the car to let the attackers know the caravan was full of women and children.

“They knew it was women and children. There is evidence of that,” she said.

Rhonita Miller and the four children in her car were repeatedly shot at until the car exploded and caught on fire. Their remains were burned to ashes except for a few bones, enough to identity all five of those in the vehicle. State authorities said more than 200 bullet casings were found near the vehicles.

Staddon told the local CBS affiliate that her sister heard the gunshots and could see the smoke from her house in La Mora, the settlement of fewer than 1,000 people about 70 miles south of Douglas, Arizona.

MacCallum also spoke with Lafe Langford Jr., another relative of the victims, who said there is no evidence to support the idea that the LaBarron family instigated the conflict with the cartel.

“The only way that we can understand it is that our family was used as bait to lure one cartel against another,” he said.

Langford also appeared on “Fox & Friends” Wednesday morning, where he explained a war between cartels had recently broken out near the Arizona border and cartel foot soldiers had been sent into Sonora to take control of smuggling routes.

“In the process, we have a lot of evidence and reason to believe that they had a strategic plan and we were attacked, unfortunately,” he said. “The vehicles that had left our community were…we believe they may have been used as bait to try to attract the cartel in Sonora to them. To bring the war to them.”",https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/07/relatives-of-family-slain-in-mexico-say-cartel-attack-was-no-accident/,2019-11-07
Kamala Harris’ Attack on Tulsi Gabbard Fell As Flat As Her Campaign,"During the fifth round of Democratic presidential debates, the moderators pitted Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and Sen. Kamala Harris of California against each other over foreign policy issues.

Harris attempted to attack Gabbard by saying Gabbard spent all her time before running for president trying to buddy up with Republicans:

I think that it’s unfortunate that we have someone on this stage who is attempting to be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States, who during the Obama administration spent four years full time on Fox News criticizing President Obama. Who has spent full time criticizing people on this stage as affiliated with the Democratic Party. When Donald Trump was elected, not even sworn in, buddied up to Steve Bannon to get a meeting with Donald Trump in the Trump Tower. Fails to call a war criminal by what he is, as a war criminal. And then spends full time during the course of this campaign, again, criticizing the Democratic Party.

“What Sen. Harris is doing is unfortunately continuing to traffic in lies and smears and innuendos,” Gabbard replied. “She cannot challenge the substance of the argument that I’m making.”

The premise of Harris’ argument against Gabbard is that working with a conservative-affiliated person or news outlet disqualifies her from serious consideration in Democratic Party politics. By setting her argument up in such a way, she not only proves Gabbard’s point that Harris is fearful of a substantive debate, but also reveals Harris’ divisive nature as a candidate.

“We need someone on [the debate] stage that can go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump and someone who has the ability to rebuild the Obama coalition and bring the party and the nation together. I believe I am that candidate,” Harris said.

However, she made that statement only seconds after attacking Gabbard for putting people above partisan politics. Obama built a coalition of independents because he ran as a candidate who could unite the nation, but Harris cannot say the same about herself — especially after attacking a candidate for working across party lines.

Harris’ fight was much more about punching back at Gabbard for the Hawaii congresswoman’s attack on Harris’ abusive prosecutorial record. Harris’ attack on Gabbard fell as flat as the California senator’s presidential campaign seems to be.

How A Mexican Cartel Nearly Triggered War Between The U.S. And Iran,"The massacre of nine dual-citizen American Mexican Mormons less than 100 miles from the border with the United States serves as a reminder of the dangers the cartels pose and the existence of one of the world’s deadliest wars in America’s own neighborhood.

The Mexican drug war and cartels don’t preoccupy the national security/foreign policy establishment and the media the same way the Syrian civil war and Middle East militants do. But the conflict south of the border isn’t only getting worse, Latin America stands to pose a greater (if not the greatest) national security challenge for the United States in years to come. If policymakers, think tanks, and the media won’t sound the alarm now, they’ll have no choice but to do so later.

That lesson was almost learned the hard way eight years ago, during Barack Obama’s presidency. A drug cartel was nearly responsible for the most devastating terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11, one that could’ve sparked a war with the Islamic Republic of Iran.

How Did This Almost Happen?

On Oct. 11, 2011, Attorney General Eric Holder and FBI Director Robert Mueller announced the plot to assassinate Saudi Ambassador to the U.S. Adel al-Jubeir had been foiled, and one of the suspects, U.S. citizen Manssor Arbabsiar, had been arrested. The other suspect, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force operative Gholam Shakuri, was never arrested and remains at large to this day.

According to the Department of Justice, Jubeir’s assassination was plotted from spring to October 2011. Throughout the year, Arbabsiar went to Mexico to enlist the services of someone he believed was an associate of a Mexican drug cartel. Only it wasn’t — his contact was actually an informant for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).

In late May, Arbabsiar traveled from Texas to Mexico to solicit the services of the informant — who then notified U.S. authorities — for an attack against Saudi diplomatic personnel or facilities in the United States. Arbabsiar specifically inquired regarding the use of explosives, to which the informant advised him the cartel was proficient in the use of C-4 plastic explosives.

Additional meetings took place in Mexico late June and mid July. There Arbabsiar told the informant his “associates in Iran,” likely the IRGC, had settled upon an assassination of Jubeir.

Arbabsiar Even Okayed Civilian Casualties

The informant agreed the cartel was willing to execute the hit at a price of $1.5 million. Within days, Arbabsiar and the informant came to an agreement, and the cartel began planning the assassination. This included gathering intelligence.

The informant told Arbabsiar he already had a cartel member doing surveillance in Washington, D.C., identifying the Saudi ambassador and determining a time, place, and parameters for attack. Jubeir frequently dined at Café Milano, an upscale Italian restaurant in the Georgetown neighborhood, so it was decided this was the ideal location for targeting the ambassador.

All this time, the informant had been recording Arbabsiar. In one of the mid-July conversations, the Iranian agent seemed fully aware of the high risk of American casualties, at one point suggesting the cartel take care not to kill innocents. But by the end of the discussion, Arbabsiar made clear the assassination needed to happen at any cost.

“They want [the ambassador] done, if the hundred go with him, [expletive] ’em,” was Arbabsiar’s disturbing and shocking proclamation on the recording. He and the informant next discussed the means by which to kill the ambassador, with Arbabsiar deferring to the cartel’s judgment. Again, he suggested limiting collateral damage, only to emphasize again the need for the ambassador to be killed regardless.

If the cartel was unable to kill Jubeir in isolation outside the restaurant, Arbabsiar was perfectly fine with bombing the establishment while he was dining. The informant then advised his client the restaurant has anywhere from 100 to 150 people inside at a given time, is surrounded by buildings, and even U.S. senators who frequent the establishment could become casualties. Once more, Arbabsiar dismissed the concerns, describing it as “no big deal.”

The Plan Was Foiled

In August, a total of $100,000 was wired to the cartel as a down payment for carrying out the operation. It isn’t clear when the assassination would have taken place, but conversations between Arbabsiar, the informant, and the leadership back in Iran (primarily Quds Force operative Shakuri) indicate it would have occurred in October. On Sept. 28, Arbabsiar boarded a plane at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport for a flight to Mexico, intending to serve himself to the cartel as collateral until the assassination was executed.

When he landed in Mexico, the trap was sprung. Denied entry by Mexican authorities, Arbabsiar was forced to fly back to NYC, where he was then arrested on September 29. In short order, he confessed to investigators his role in the plot. He cooperated with the FBI as they attempted to build a case against Shakuri, who was, until Holder and Mueller’s Oct. 11 announcement, unaware Arbabsiar had been caught.

Tragedy had been averted, and the arrest and eventual conviction of Arbabsiar was one of the lesser-known victories in the War on Terror. Still, the incident is highly unsettling. Although the affidavit doesn’t identify the cartel (referring to it only as “Drug Cartel #1”), it does describe it as:

[A] large, sophisticated, and violent drug-trafficking cartel. It is well-known throughout North America, and its principal places of operation are Mexico and the United States. … Drug Cartel #1 has access to military-grade weaponry and explosives, and has engaged in numerous acts of violence, including assassinations and murders.

Based on the description, this cartel is probably a “household name,” easily recognized by authorities and the public if revealed. This same cartel is likely still active inside the United States and a belligerent in the Mexican drug war.

Clearly, Iran felt confident it could, for the right price, trust Mexican drug cartels to do Tehran’s dirty work. With such able and willing enemies just over the border, the threats of groups such as al Qaeda and ISIS seem distant by comparison.

This ‘Act of War’ Would Have Changed Obama’s Presidency

Former Defense Secretary James Mattis hammered home the gravity of this “act of war.” Mattis, who was the commander of Central Command (CENTCOM) at the time, spoke of the event in great detail in his memoir, published earlier this year.

“It would have changed history,” he said, noting he’d also seen incriminating intelligence of Tehran’s direct involvement. “Had the bomb gone off, those in the restaurant and on the street would have been ripped apart, blood rushing down sewer drains,” Mattis gruesomely described the consequences of the attack had it been successful.

It would’ve also changed the course of the Obama presidency. The 44th president made a grand bargain with Iran a central focus of his foreign policy. Had the assassination succeeded, the Iran nuclear deal would’ve been off the table. Even members of his own Cabinet would have advised against negotiating with a regime responsible for such an overt act of hostility.

It would have also jeopardized Obama’s prospects of reelection. Opposition candidates would have used the incident as proof his critics were right all along: Obama was weak on national security and Iran.

Of course, that also would have depended on how Obama responded to the attack. George W. Bush won reelection in 2004 in large part due to his response to the 9/11 attacks. It would’ve been politically disastrous for Obama not to retaliate in overt, resolute fashion. But what should he have done?

Mattis argued Obama should have drummed up public support for a tougher line against Iran, evoking Woodrow Wilson and the 1917 Zimmermann Telegram, laying the groundwork for military action. Having held an adversarial stance toward Iran his entire career (and possibly relieved of command for it), Mattis clearly considers October 2011 a missed opportunity to resoundingly punish the ayatollah and his cronies for their crimes.

We Can No Longer Ignore Mexican Drug Cartels

A retaliation never happened, of course, because the assassination wasn’t successful. Had it been, the White House may have had no choice but to pay greater heed to Mattis’ suggestions.

2011 was a year of escalating tensions with Iran over its nuclear program. A few months after the assassination was foiled, a military build-up, including British and French forces, took place in the Gulf. Thus, if Washington and its allies sought to take action against Tehran, the military presence was available to make it happen.

Israel, which at the time was threatening preemptive military action against Iran over its nuclear program, could’ve leveraged the incident to push Washington to strike on its behalf. Given the level of hostilities brewing at the time, a successful killing of Jubeir seems like the spark that could have lit the proverbial powder keg.

Eight years later, the Mexican drug cartel threat seems to sow division rather than collective urgency. Policymakers remain entranced by the Middle East, while the media offered scant coverage of the deaths of nine American-Mexican dual citizens. In the past, both groups have focused on frivolous matters, such as President Donald Trump’s rhetoric toward cartel-associated groups such as MS-13. Nor does the problem elicit significant concern among the Democratic presidential candidates.

But the day will come when the threat can no longer be ignored. In the meantime, those dismissive of the danger posed by the Mexican drug cartels ought to learn of the time they nearly carried out the worst terrorist attack in America since 9/11 and almost triggered a resulting war with Iran. A lone informant within a cartel averting catastrophe serves as very cold comfort, indeed.

The London Terrorist Attack Shows Rehabilitative Justice Doesn’t Work,"The British police force was severely cut under prime ministers Tony Blair and David Cameron, the British version of the liberal-neocon duopoly who, just like their American counterparts, believed in the transformative nature of justice. Transform they did, although not criminals and terrorists. Instead they transformed their countries for worse. The British police force is kneecapped by its own ruling class, the product of its new woke elite, complete with crackpot theories and activist impulses.

The U.K. death penalty was removed due to the liberal empire. Police patrols were de-sexed — mom and dad duos, as some Brits call them. Now U.K. police are represented by a middle-aged, overweight, balding man and a plump woman in comical fluorescent jackets, looking more like road repair workmen than law enforcement officers, standing on street corners looking bored as they do their daily hours. In police stations, woke officers are more interested in checking mean tweets and dancing during LGBT parades than in catching criminals.

Civilians Are Taking the Law Into Their Own Hands

But that’s not all. Even when the specialized police force actually properly works, like this time when it took only five minutes from reporting time to take down a terrorist, it is kneecapped.

Consider this latest case. The terrorist Usman Khan was caught and docked after he planned a mass murder in the London Stock Exchange in 2012. The punishment was hideously lenient, even from the beginning. The total jail sentence was 16 years. Yet halfway through the sentence, he was released by activist judges who, given their enormous wisdom, decided an electronic tag could control this maniac.

Think about that for a moment. A violent and emotionally stunted man, radicalized by an ideology that promises martyrdom for mass murder, was thought to be controllable with only an ankle tag to monitor his movements, by our judges, who live in guarded mansions. Naturally, when this man fled his house, got a giant knife, and started indiscriminately stabbing people on the London Bridge, members of the public were left to stop a terrorist with a fire extinguisher and a pub-door decoration of a Narwhal tusk.

During a similar attack in the same place, another random Londoner took on a knife-wielding terrorist with pub chairs and bare fists. The official London police policy for civilians during a terror attack is to run and hide. It is increasingly clear that Londoners refuse to likewise run and hide. They are also increasingly taking the law into their own hands against street muggers and criminal gangs.

Rehabilitative Justice Doesn’t Work

Almost like clockwork, leftist media started warning against a “knee-jerk” reaction in the wake of the Friday terrorist attack. A war of words broke out between a Conservative minister and her Labour counterpart regarding who was responsible for the early-release legislation, with the Labour MP falling on the side of “rehabilitation.”

That is the crux of the problem. Modern Western law enforcement and academic theories behind it tilt heavily toward rehabilitative justice instead of a classical and orthodox punitive deterrence — almost so much, it verges on utopia. Led by leftist professors and academics with flawed research and biased conclusions, churned out like gospel truth by sympathetic urban liberal journalists, and enforced by law enforcement officers and hyper-liberal activist judges, for more than 40 years our society has been slowly but surely transformed from within.

This applies not only to terrorism, which is numerically at its lowest. The root cause of favoring rehabilitation over deterrence has taken a toll. Every medium of propaganda from mass media, to films, to music, has glamorized crime and criminals, who are always helpless victims of social injustice and structural inequality, just one reform away from being Nelson Mandela.

Case in point, the terror apologizers in the U.K., called CAGE, have systematically blamed all terror attacks on persecution of Muslims. They’re a British version of the Southern Poverty Law Center, if you like.

Criminal Justice Must Be Punitive

This is unsustainable. Chris Phillips, a former head of the U.K. national counterterrorism security office, was quoted in The Guardian, of all places, saying:

The criminal justice system needs to look at itself. We’re letting people out of prison, we’re convicting people for very, very serious offences and then they are releasing them back into society when they are still radicalised. So how on earth can we ever ask our police services and our security services to keep us safe? I’ve said it a few times today, we’re playing Russian roulette with people’s lives, letting convicted, known, radicalised Jihadi criminals walk about our streets.

Unfortunately, nothing will change unless heads start rolling. The common people in both the U.K. and the U.S. don’t care about harebrained schemes. Most people want the government to do minimum: govern, provide security and safety, and maintain the public works and streets. Fewer advertisement bans, fewer plastic straw bans, and more severe punishments for habitual offenders.

But our elite classes — from academics, to bleeding-heart nonprofit organizations and politicians, to activist judges — don’t get to feel the pain of their idealistic utopian theories. There is no accountability.

They are not facing the brunt of stupid misadventure in Mesopotamia. They are not getting murdered in random gang violence in the streets of South London, or walking through the diarrhea-, vomit-, blood-, and syringe-filled streets of San Francisco. Like modern versions of Marie-Louise Thérèse of Savoy-Carignan, they are sowing the seeds of populist uprisings.

U.K.'s Jeremy Corbyn Has A Long History Of Openly Supporting Terrorists,"In an interview on Sunday with Sky News, U.K. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn stated that convicted terrorists should “not necessarily” serve out the entirety of their prison terms. His statement comes on the heels of Friday’s terror attack on London Bridge, in which two Brits were stabbed to death by a convicted terrorist who had been released early from prison.

Corbyn’s softness towards terrorism should surprise no one, at least not those who have been paying attention to his unnervingly friendly attitude towards extremists over the past several decades (one Twitter user created a lengthy list). Corbyn is the quintessential terrorist sympathizer, harboring a particular, yet unsurprising, penchant for the antisemitic ones who usually find a safe haven within the anti-Zionist movement.

In the early 2000s, Corbyn led a campaign advocating for the release of two terrorists convicted for their roles in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish charity and the Israeli embassy in London. Jawad Botmeh and Samar Alami, each jailed for 20 years, were found guilty of “conspiring to cause explosions in the United Kingdom” in December of 1996.

While both admitted to possessing the five pounds of explosives and three handguns in a storage unit, the pair insisted that the materials were not intended for use in the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, during their trial, Botmeh and Alami, both engineers, admitted to testing homemade explosives in England’s Peak District in order to send information back to Palestinians living in the Palestinian territories.

In addition to advocating for lighter sentences for convicted terrorist conspirators, Corbyn has also used softened language when speaking of terrorist groups. In 2009, at a meeting held by the anti-war group Stop the War Coalition, Corbyn referred to members of Hamas and Hezbollah, two groups designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations by the U.S. State Department, as “friends.” He then proceeded to chastise the Israelis for not permitting members of Hamas to fly to the United Kingdom to meet with members of Parliament.

“Tomorrow it will be my pleasure and honor to host an event in Parliament where our friends from Hezbollah will be speaking.” Corbyn said. He continued. “I’ve also invited friends from Hamas to come and speak, as well. Unfortunately, the Israelis would not allow them to travel here, so it’s only going to be friends from Hezbollah.” He has both defended the statement and regretted it, although given his general attitude towards terrorists—as this article will demonstrate—the regret is likely minimal.

Corbyn’s open affinity for such terrorists was part of a larger pattern. That same year, Corbyn invited Arab extremist Dyab Abou Jahjah to speak at an event for Stop the War Coalition. After his 2009 visit, Jahjah was banned from entering the United Kingdom.

Although Jahjah has been “normalized” in some intellectual circles, he has made several objectively terrible statements, often lauding violence. Two months after the 9/11 terror attacks, Jahjah labeled the al-Qaeda terrorists “criminals” but then proceeded to allege that he and other Muslims had experienced a “sweet revenge feeling” after the attack on the Twin Towers. In 2003, when commenting on the war in Iraq, he told the Flemish newspaper Het Laaste Nieuws, “I consider every death of an American, British or Dutch soldier as a victory.”

Unsurprisingly, just two years ago, Jahjah was fired from a Belgian newspaper for applauding a terror attack in Jerusalem by a Palestinian who plowed a truck through a crowd of Israeli soldiers. It was later revealed that the driver was a supporter of the Islamic state.

In addition to portraying himself as a friend to terrorists, Corbyn has made several attempts to intellectualize their violent rhetoric. In 2012, Corbyn sat on a panel at a conference in Doha, Qatar alongside several Palestinian terrorists who had been convicted of murder and then released by Israel in exchange for a captured soldier. Corbyn later referred to “their contribution” to the conference as “fascinating and electrifying.” In attendance at the conference was Husam Badran, the former leader of Hamas’ military wing and mastermind of several terrorist attacks in which dozens of Israelis were killed during the Second Intifada.

Corbyn speaks at terrorist sympathizers’ rallies, too. That same year, Corbyn’s voice pounded thunderously through the speakers at the pro-Hezbollah, pro-Iran Al Quds Day March, an event held in a number of cities around the world in which participants advocate for the destruction of Israel via the “liberation” of the land from the “infidels.”

The rallies have been infamous for providing a safe haven not only to rabid antisemites but to supporters of the Iranian terrorist proxy, Hezbollah (although there is often much crossover between the two groups). It’s worth noting that earlier this year, the U.K. Parliament voted to ban the entirety of Hezbollah, thus allowing for the confiscation of Hezbollah paraphernalia at such events as Al Quds, following a resolution that eliminated the distinction between Hezbollah’s alleged military and political wings.

Corbyn’s association with Al Quds Day is not merely a passing fad. In 2016, Corbyn attended a book launch hosted by the Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC), the same squad that organizes Al Quds Day rallies. In addition to overseeing such distasteful events, IHRC is also the same group that “gave its ‘Islamophobe of the Year’ award to the murdered staff of Charlie Hebdo — two months after they were butchered — and whose Genocide Memorial Day is deliberately timed to undermine Holocaust Memorial Day,” according to the Vice President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Mari van der Zyl.

In one of Corbyn’s most infamous terrorist-sympathizing events, he appeared at a ceremony in Tunisia honoring the Palestinian-Arab terrorists who carried out the 1972 Munich terror attack, where 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team were viciously slaughtered. In an act that can only be described as heinous, Corbyn laid a wreath on the grave of one of the terrorists and, in the face of widespread condemnation, delivered no apology.

What is perhaps most frightening about the vignettes described above is that they provide only a brief snapshot of the depth to which Corbyn fraternizes with terrorists. There are many more.

Indeed, in most of these stories Corbyn demonstrates a wholly discomfiting admiration for murderous figures who feel no compunction in celebrating death. He calls such terrorists “friends,” speaks at their rallies, intellectualizes their violent hatred, and lays wreaths on their graves. If this type of behavior is not disqualifying for becoming prime minister of the United Kingdom, frankly, I am unsure what is.

These 4 Factors Will Likely Determine The U.K. Election Outcome,"The United Kingdom will hold a general election on Thursday, December 12. Voters will not only decide who should be their next prime minister—Tory’s Boris Johnson or Labor’s Jeremy Corbyn—but also the fate of their nation, which isn’t only about Brexit. Should Corbyn become the next PM, Britain will remain in the European Union while undergoing a socialist revolution.

The most recent YouGov poll predicts that Johnson will win, and that his Conservative Party will become a majority in the Parliament, with 38 seats more than the opposition Labor Party. However, Johnson and his Conservative Party should not relax and completely rely on this prediction, as polls can be notoriously unreliable.

Just a few weeks ago, the same poll illustrated that Johnson’s Conservative Party led by as much as 68 seats. As election day gets closer, his party’s lead is shrinking, and that’s a troubling trend. Which party will win the election depends on how voters feel about four things.

1. Brexit, Obviously

The first is obviously Brexit. Since the 2016 historic vote to exit the EU, Britain has been the laughingstock of the world, because the majority of the British Parliament has actively sabotaged every effort to make Brexit happen. They voted down former Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal multiple times, and eventually May was forced to resign. They passed the “Benn Act” this year, stipulating that if the current Prime Minister Johnson couldn’t get the MPs to approve a new Brexit deal by October 19, he must request a three-month Brexit extension from the EU by 11 p.m. that day.

However, when Johnson, against all odds, brought home a newly negotiated and much better Brexit deal on October 18, the Parliament chose not to even vote on the deal on Saturday, October 19. Their inaction triggered the Benn Act, which forced Johnson to request yet another delay from the EU. The EU grudgingly extended the Brexit deadline to January 31, 2020, but the EU’s patience has run out.

The European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, said , “the uncertainty of Brexit has gone on for far too long. This extra time must deliver a way forward.” Sounds like an ultimatum.

The “leave” camp is more motivated than ever now. They are fed up with this Parliament and feel this election is their only chance to get Brexit done. Not only do they have to keep Johnson at No. 10 Downing Street, but also make his party a majority by voting out those MPs who have ignored the people’s will and have put the nation and millions of its people through three years of manufactured chaos and humiliation.

2. Is Remain Worth Antisemitic Socialism?

While the “leave” camp has a clear and straightforward choice, the choice for those “remainders” is much more complicated. They essentially have to decide which option is worse: leaving the EU, or having Corbyn in charge.

Therefore, the second factor that will influence the election outcome is whether a sufficient number of remainders decide that putting Corbyn and the Labor Party in charge is far worse than leaving the EU. Corbyn made the decision easier for them by publishing a Labor Party Manifesto recently, detailing how he plans to revolutionize Britain’s social and economic systems if he becomes the prime minister.

Like all socialists, Corbyn promised lots of free stuff: free broadband for all, delivered by partially nationalizing British Telecom; a £3 billion plan to offer adults in England free access to retraining; £75 billion to build 150,000 new council and social homes each year, within five years.

In health care, Corbyn promises free annual dental check-ups, free prescriptions, and free personal at-home care in England for those over 65 who are most in need of it; an annual budget increase of 4.3 percent for National Health System, and a lifetime cap on the maximum people have to pay for care.

Of course, Corbyn proposes “green” initiatives too: reinstating 3,000 bus routes that have been cut; setting up a £250 billion Green Transformation Fund, to be paid for through borrowing, to fund 300,000 new “green apprenticeships” and loans for people to buy electric cars. To please unions, he pledges an immediate 5 percent pay rise for government workers, with year-on-year above-inflation pay raises to follow and mandates for a “real living wage” of at least £10 an hour.

It is estimated that Corbyn will have to raise an additional £83 billion a year to fund these expensive programs. Few voters believe Corbyn can deliver all these outlandish promises.

However, Corbyn has expressed that he would make corporations and “the rich” pay, rather than the rest of the voters. He would raise corporate tax rate and impose a new financial transaction tax; increase dividend and interest taxes; impose a value-added tax on private schools; add a second homes tax equivalent to 200 percent of the property’s council tax bill; and increase income tax on those who make more than £80,000 a year. Clearly, the middle class in Britain will take the biggest financial hit under Corbyn’s socialist revolution.

Corbyn also promises to nationalize Britain’s key industries such as railroads, mail, water, and energy, which a government agency estimates would cost at least £196 billion initially, with future additional costs unknown.

Besides causing significant economic distress, Corbyn plans to transform the United Kingdom in other ways. He proposes to place a third of elected “worker representatives” on corporate boards, and to hire “human rights advisers” to set up a Social Justice Commission at the Foreign Office and make an inquiry into “fake news” in the media.

Many Brits voted for “remaining” in the EU because they believed that leaving the EU would cause disruptions to Britain’s economy and their quality of life. However, under Corbyn, the British people would not only experience far worse economic prospects, but also experience erosions to their political freedom.

3. Labour’s Open Antisemitism

The third factor the “remainers” have to wrestle with about a government under Corbyn is the Labor Party’s culture of antisemitism. Corbyn has been accused of not only unwilling to deal with antisemitism within his party but also of potentially sharing antisemitic views himself.

In an November 26 op-ed, Ephraim Mirvis, the chief rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, said Corbyn is unfit for the prime minister’s position, and called Corbyn’s failure to address antisemitism within the Labor Party “a failure to see this as a human problem rather than a political one. It is a failure of culture. It is a failure of leadership. A new poison – sanctioned from the top – has taken root in the Labour Party.”

He concluded by asking “every person to vote with their conscience. Be in no doubt, the very soul of our nation is at stake.” When Corbyn was asked about the rabbi’s op-ed, he said he welcomed a dialogue with the rabbi, but refused to apologize to British Jews.

Probably by Divine intervention, The Sunday Times obtained and published leaked files from the Labor Party that revealed how disturbing some of the Labor Party members’ antisemitic comments and behaviors are, exemplifying that Corbyn’s “zero tolerance” policy was a blatant lie. According to The Sunday Times, “Labour members likening Jewish people to killer viruses, labelling them ‘bent nose manipulative liars’ and calling for the ‘extermination of every Jew on the planet.'”

When facing complaints about fellow members’ antisemitic comments and behaviors, party leadership has been slow to act. Some cases have been left unresolved for a long time, and others were resolved with a “slap-on-the-wrist” kind of lenient sanction.

Here is an example from the leaked files: “One Labour member from Nottingham wrote that ‘Jews represent a viral infection that need to be completely eliminated’ and said he wanted the ‘complete extinction of all Jews.’ It took more than 10 months for the party to expel him after his case was first reported in 2018.”

After the Times reported on the leaked files, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, another diehard socialist, apologized to British Jews for the first time, and admitted that the party’s poor handling of its members’ antisemitic comments and behaviors has damaged its prospects in the upcoming general election.

4. The Recent London Terror Attack

The fourth factor that will influence how Brits will vote on Thursday is the recent terrorist attack in London, in which a supposedly rehabilitated jihadist stabbed two people to death and wounded three more before he was shot to death by police.

Corbyn has more than a soft spot for terrorists. He admitted in his own words: “I’ve been involved in opposing anti-terror legislation ever since I first went into Parliament in 1983.” He condemned the United States for killing Osama Bin Laden. Recently, when pressed by BBC host Andrew Neil in an interview (prior to the Dec. 1 London Bridge attack), Corbyn refused to say whether he would give the order to shoot an ISIS terrorist who refused to surrender.

On crime and security issues, voters usually trust the Conservative Party more than the Labor Party. After the London Bridge attack, a poll showed that “the Conservatives have solid public leads over Labor — by 36 percent to 19 percent on law and order, and 39 percent to 15 percent on defense.” Johnson has vowed to increase the number of police and impose harsher sentences on dangerous criminals. Since this event took place at a time so close to the general election, it may influence voters who prioritize security, law, and order to vote for Johnson and the Conservative Party.

This upcoming election is much bigger than just Brexit. Voters face two starkly contrasting choices, two different ideologies, and two very different futures for Britain. If the “remainders” let their desire to keep the UK within the EU to override their judgment and conscience, voting for Corbyn on December 12 might be the biggest mistake of their lives.

Democrats’ Impeachment Is A Political Kamikaze Attack,"In October 1944, the situation for the Japanese looked desperate, enough for them to use the most desperate of all weapons, the kamikaze. The Japanese welded bombs to planes the kamikaze pilots flew into the superior U.S. Navy. The pilot typically died in the attack, along with whatever sailors he managed to kill in the crash.

Kamikaze attacks sank 34 ships during the war. At Okinawa, an island Japan considered part of the homeland, they inflicted the greatest losses ever sustained by the Navy in a single battle.

Impeachment feels a lot like a political kamikaze attack on President Trump. I’ve been searching for a rational explanation for why Democrats would pin all of their political hopes on a trial in the Senate. As far as I can see, the best possible outcome for Democrats after a Senate trial will be to distract and annoy the president until the Senate delivers a “hung jury” of more than 50 senators but fewer than the 67 needed to get him removed.

Even if Democrats did succeed in a trial in the Senate, the outcome would barely precede the 2020 election, which could reinstate Trump right back to the White House. As noted by Business Insider, “While the constitution lays out a mechanism to remove a president from office, it doesn’t prevent a president or other ‘civil officer’ removed from their office by the impeachment process from running for office or being elected to federal office again.”

What will be the turnout of Trump’s supporters if they are given the opportunity to overturn a swamp-based removal? In an electorate that typically turns out at around 50-60 percent in presidential elections, turning up the intensity of Trump voters could magnify their impact in the election.

To date, the Democrats have had total control of all major aspects of the process. Impeachment leader Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., used his gavel to shut down every single witness called by the Republicans (but not the Democrats). The legacy media coordinated the public relations message, running nearly 100 percent negative commentary between the handpicked anti-Trump witnesses.

Yet the hearings have failed to recruit any new support for impeachment. This is likely the high water mark for public support for impeachment. It’s reasonable to believe it will only decline from this point. I told my friends the Democrats would come to their senses. I predicted that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., would kill impeachment in committee to instead resort to a resolution of admonishment or censure. Logically, that seems like the best possible outcome from Democrats.

Those of us who follow politics have been looking carefully for some plan or a hole card that might justify this audacious risk. Have they already secretly flipped Never Trumper senators? That seems very unlikely. Even Sen. Mitt Romney, a man who seems to hate Trump with the intensity of a thousand suns, has tempered his usual anti-Trump rhetoric with a bland criticism of Trump’s interest in Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.

Romney told constituents he wasn’t paying close attention to the day-to-day hearings. That’s really bad news for anyone hoping to flip 18 Republicans to get to the magic number of 67.

Is there a bombshell scandal that they’re keeping in reserve, like the Christine Blasey Ford surprise at the end of the Brett Kavanaugh hearing? People have been predicting that various “bombshell” reports would take down Trump since he announced his candidacy. A new one has come out every 45 to 60 days for the past three to four years. Maybe the next one will be different. But probably not.

When Trump asked about the Bidens in the Ukraine call, he fulfilled a campaign pledge to disregard the immunity that elitists like Biden have come to expect. Trump promised his voters he would drain the swamp. The chants of “lock her up,” were expressed frustration at the two-tiered justice system.

Names like Clinton, Epstein, Kennedy, McCabe, Podesta, and now Biden seem to never fear any exposure to the laws under which the rest of us peasants must live. That’s not fair. And that’s not the rule of law.

Notwithstanding that Biden is a “political opponent” of Trump, how would Trump’s voters have reacted if he had shrunk from inquiring into the Burisma-Hunter-Joe golden triangle that made Joe Biden’s son millions in apparent exchange for Joe’s intervention to have a prosecutor fired? Trump voters would have felt outraged and betrayed by a swamp-drainer who kowtowed to elite privilege.

But, the narrative goes, the allegations against the Bidens are “debunked” and “discredited.” Oh? When was that trial? To remove Trump for asking about the Biden golden triangle, you will need to prove that Trump was totally off-base in following his nose to their very stinky arrangement.

If we’re going with a “bribery” or “abuse of power” theory, the Democrats will have to show there’s no legitimate law-enforcement interest in looking at the Bidens. If Trump is not allowed to call Hunter and Joe to show why there were legitimate corruption concerns, it will not be a fair trial.

We can now add to the mix the very sketchy actions of Schiff, who promised secret evidence that he never delivered. He made those promises in the court of public opinion. It will not be a fair trial if the president is not given the opportunity to cross-examine Schiff on those claims.

Further, Schiff is interfering with the president’s right to have effective assistance of an attorney by publishing logs of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani’s calls. That chills potential cooperation from sources and leads who might want to stay anonymous. Where did Schiff get those logs? I think the president has a right to ask him that under oath. It should concern us that the chief of the intelligence oversight committee is himself spying.

When you see Joe Biden explode during a town hall in response to very foreseeable question about the Joe/Hunter/Burisma arrangement, you’re not watching a man eager to appear in the Senate to explain all of this. And when you see Pelosi explode over being asked whether she “hates” the president, you’re witnessing an unguarded glimpse of the cauldron of anxiety and fear that boils within her.

Why can’t Pelosi peel off at least one Never Trump Republican in the House? Because, Pelosi said, the Republicans have failed to meet the standard of honoring their oath of office. Oh, so vote with Democrats or you’re a traitor? That doesn’t seem like a recipe for bipartisan persuasion.

This is going badly for Democrats. Still, I will pray for Pelosi and her Democrats this Sunday. It’s not my desire to see them suffer. Maybe somebody can talk them out of the cockpits of their impeachment kamikazes before they permanently harm the country in a spectacular political suicide.

Pretending Racism Against Jews Is Only The Right’s Problem Is Fueling It,"It’s time to have a national conversation about antisemitism. Not an abbreviated one that starts with neo-Nazis and ends with the alt-right. No, a real one.

For the mainstream media and many public officials (cough, Bill de Blasio, cough), it’s been convenient and even preferable to discuss antisemitism in that one, narrow way. Like a predictable movie, the narrative about American antisemitism has long been that it’s a far-right problem. It’s true, the far-right has always been antisemitic. I’ve yet to meet any Jew who would say otherwise.

The less convenient corollary is that antisemitism is not confined to the far-right, not least because the political spectrum is increasingly egg-shaped, especially where Jew hatred is concerned. When discussing Jews, the language of the far-left and far-right is increasingly overlapping, which is no coincidence, according to a new report from Zachor Legal Institute and StopAntisemitism.org. It’s why activist Linda Sarsour references David Duke, who praises Rep. Ilhan Omar.

Antisemitism is the great unifier, ideologically aligning those who may dress differently but think similarly. Unless and until that’s widely accepted, it will be significantly harder to push antisemitism back to society’s fringes — and we must. It’s not only a matter of safeguarding the lives of Jewish citizens, but also of protecting American democracy. Widespread acceptance of conspiracy theories like antisemitism is not a mark of a healthy, vibrant society.

Antisemitic Violence Has Risen

In little more than a year, antisemitism has turned deadly three times for American Jews. On Oct. 27, 2018, a gunman murdered 11 Jews gathered for prayer at the Tree of Life Congregation in Pittsburgh. On April 27, 2019, another gunman attacked the Chabad of Poway, California, taking the life of another praying Jew. Then last Tuesday, three people were murdered at a kosher supermarket in Jersey City, New Jersey.

The victims in Jersey City included store owner Leah Minda Ferencz (age 33), Ferencz’s cousin Moshe Deutsch (age 24), and store employee Douglas Rodríguez (age 49). The attackers also killed Detective Joseph Seals, a father of five. These deaths were totally unnecessary. Yet as heinous as this attack was, knowing the intended target was likely the 50 children attending the Jewish school beside the grocery store is even more horrific.

For Jews who’ve watched antisemitic violence rise first overseas and now here at home, the Jersey City attack recalls the assault on the Paris area Hyper Cacher in January 2015, when “an Islamist gunman killed three customers and an employee” at the kosher market, which burned down precisely three years later. Such attacks are not random. They clearly target Jews.

Reports indicate that Jersey City attackers Francine Graham and David Anderson attended “an anti-Semitic Black Hebrew Israelite church in Harlem.” A neighbor also reported overhearing Anderson repeatedly listening to recordings of Louis Farrakhan, a virulent antisemite with links to the initial leadership team of the Women’s March and congressional Democrats, who has been photographed with Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. That is to say, the attackers appear to have been inspired by sources that were neither white supremacist nor of the right.

Leaders Must Be Honest About Antisemitism

Antisemitism takes numerous forms. For the safety of American Jews, it’s time society takes all those threats seriously.

So it’s not helpful when New York City’s mayor doubles down on his insistence that antisemitism is a right-wing problem, telling New York public radio’s Brian Lehrer last Friday, “We have to have an honest conversation. … There are folks who identify on the left who are saying and doing antisemitic things although it has not taken a systematic violent form. … I think there is a lot of evidence in this country, not just in terms of antisemitism, but violent acts in general … that’s coming from the white supremacy movement.”

This is an epic refusal to acknowledge reality. Ongoing attacks on visibly Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn have been violent. They have occurred for years now, and white supremacists are not perpetrating them. Just this month in Brooklyn, a Jewish woman was called “the F… Jew with the wig,” as another woman threatened to throw her onto subway tracks, and three teens stoned a Jewish girls’ school bus, shattering a window.

We Must Condemn Antisemitism, Not Downplay It

Downplaying deadly attacks on Hasidic Jews and explaining the Jersey City attacks as some sort of response to “tensions” in the community or gentrification by relative newcomers, as the Wall Street Journal and The New Yorker have, would be considered victim-blaming in other contexts.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the country, police are investigating the Friday night attack on a Persian synagogue in Beverly Hills. Bizarrely, in spite of religious ritual items, such as Torahs, being mistreated inside a synagogue, police say there are “no overt signs of antisemitism.” Have words lost all meaning?

It just shouldn’t be this hard for our leaders and the media to recognize and condemn antisemitism. Without widespread pushback, antisemitism could become normalized.

History’s already broadcast numerous episodes of this same show. A society that can’t truly tolerate its Jewish minority quickly becomes a dangerous place for other religious, racial, and ethnic minority groups, too. If we’re going to prevent a rerun of some of history’s worst chapters, we must stop antisemitism now.

Identity Politics Enables Anti-Semitic Violence. Enough,"Yesterday evening marked the seventh night of Chanukah. It also marked the ninth anti-semitic attack since the Jewish holiday began last week. According to authorities, at least five people were stabbed Saturday evening during a Chanukah candle-lighting ceremony at a rabbi’s home in the New York City suburb of Monsey.

A man allegedly used a machete to stab five people, with two reportedly in critical condition. According to reports, the attacker attempted to break into the synagogue next door to the rabbi’s home, but the doors were swiftly barricaded. It will be telling to see how this particular attack is covered within the mainstream press, and by regional and national Democrats who have shown an antipathy to addressing antisemitism if it comes from actors with whom they generally sympathize.

When it came to discussing the recent shooting at the Jersey City kosher supermarket by two Black Hebrew Israelites, reporting was startlingly sparse on the particulars surrounding the murders. As Bethany Mandel of Ricochet noted, many key details appeared purposely omitted, including but not limited to, the fact that video footage suggested the perpetrators’ initial target was a school full of Jewish children; that the perpetrators had a significant amount of ammunition; and that videos taken after the attack revealed many in the neighborhood blamed the Jews for the attack. Even following the killings, I am not sure if even one media outlet reported on the fact that a school board member in Jersey City, referring to Jews as “brutes,” essentially defended the murders as a natural response to too many Jews moving into the area.

The “social justice” arena in the United States, where most issues related to racial discrimination get siloed, is occupied primarily by those on the left. Thus, the growing problem is now groups traditionally in the business of confronting hate are less interested in doing so if they are unable to attribute the Jew-hatred to Trump or Republicans. If that anti-semitism is emanating from corners traditionally occupied by the left, the advocacy figures and media talking heads show an alarming and frankly disturbing indifference.

Nothing evinces this indifference more than a recent interview with Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City. When questioned about the attack on the Jersey City kosher supermarket earlier this month, Mayor de Blasio ignored the motivations of the perpetrators, who belonged to a radical left-wing fringe group known as the Black Hebrew Israelites. Instead, he deflected in a bizarre maneuver, opting to discuss the scourge of white supremacy and private militias. It’s important to talk about the far-right, but it’s also critical to talk about the far-left, particularly when those carrying out a slew of recent attacks are of such ilk.

Furthermore, there is also a race element to these attacks against Jews that has made the racial-hierarchy-obsessed left struggle to address the problem with any teeth. The vast majority of hate crimes committed against Jews in New York City have been carried out by people of color, and early reports alleging the identity of the recent murderer reveal the current attack may be no exception. This pattern presents a true problem for the left. As my colleague David Marcus has written, “The notion that hatred is harbored by some in the black community towards Jews does not comport with their hierarchies of oppression.” And indeed, the left, in all its racial obsession, has picked favorites. And they didn’t choose the Jews.

Following De Blasio’s announcement a few days ago that he would be increasing police presence in Jewish areas, leftists rushed to Twitter, condemning the move, alleging that heightened security for Jews marginalized people of color. But this reaction reveals the precise poison of identity politics. There is a hierarchy of victimhood established within the Marxist framework of identity politics, and according to the sheepish left, Jews do not rank high enough on the victimhood totem pole to deserve increased protections, when compared to other minorities. Identity politics is racial reductionism that should nauseate and disgust every decent human being, including our supposed moral betters in the media who continue to remain obvious practitioners of it. And Jews are dying because of it—namely, because identity politics demand that violence against Jews be ignored in favor of “protecting” other minority groups. This type of selectivity actually worsens racial relations rather than improving them.

The left has spent the last three years marketing itself as having seized the moral high ground on tackling Jew-hatred, which may explain why their recent anger towards Trump’s Executive Order a few weeks ago, designed exclusively to combat antisemitism on college campuses, was particularly virulent. The mask has slipped, and for the left, battling antisemitism has become a means towards eviscerating the right, rather than a noble end in and of itself. I am curious how much more Jewish blood will need to be spilled before ending violence becomes an end inherently worth pursuing.

A pervasive notion persists in American academic circles, and within the American media, that progressive anti-semitism simply doesn’t exist – or worse still, that remaining faithful to the hierarchy of oppression within the schema of identity politics is more important than Jewish life. This thought pattern, which continues to rot the brains of those on the left and of their compatriots within the US media, is not only vile but possibly fatal for Jews. Enough.

My prayers are with those families and communities who have watched their loved ones suffer.

We Can No Longer Ignore The Attacks On Jews In New York,"In Rockland County last night, during a Chanukah celebration at a synagogue a man stormed in with a machete and stabbed at least five victims, who were taken to the hospital. This is the latest in a string of antisemitic attacks in the New York City area, coming in the wake of the tragic killing of four people during an attack on a Jewish grocery store in Jersey City.

These two acts of violence this month have brought renewed attention to the sharp uptick in anti Jewish violence that has quietly held New York City in its grip over the past few years. Sadly, Mayor Bill de Blasio, who spent much of the year more concerned with his farcical run for president than protecting the citizens of his own city, and the state governments of New York and New Jersey have, been flatfooted in addressing the growing concern.

It has frankly been astounding how little attention attacks on Jews in the New York City area have received. If any other minority group were subject to such abuse, it would be a leading national story. Why have these attacks been swept under the carpet? The clearest answer seems to be that the news media and our political leadership are uncomfortable with the fact that many of these attacks, including last night’s, were perpetrated by black people.

Make no mistake, if white supremacists in MAGA hats were shooting minorities or carving them up with machetes, it wouldn’t just be news, it would be the only news. So satisfying would that narrative be to our politicians and scribes that we would scarcely be able to turn away. But alas, it’s Jews being killed and maimed. And the criminals don’t fit the bill of right-wing, Trump-supporting Nazis, so, you know, it’s complicated.

De Blasio, who has ignored this festering problem for years, had this to tweet last night: “Horrific, So many Jewish families in our city have close ties to Monsey. We cannot overstate the fear people are feeling right now. I’ve spoken to longtime friends who, for the first time in their lives, are fearful to show outward signs of their Jewish faith.”

Seriously, Bill? You are just realizing this now? Attacks on ultra-Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn have become an almost weekly occurrence under de Blasio. Synagogues and schuls are vandalized regularly, and children and old people are attacked. This is a crisis and has all too often happened throughout Jewish history. It has typically been ignored at best. At worst, the victims are blamed for not fitting in.

Nobody wants to talk about it, but something is going on between the black and Jewish communities in the New York City area that needs to be addressed. The Jersey City shooters were Black Hebrew Israelites; the machete-wielding man who attacked last night was also identified as black. It is time we stop simply wishing that this problem did not exist and address it full on.

For progressives like de Blasio, this is hard to do. The notion that hatred is harbored by some in the black community towards Jews does not comport with their hierarchies of oppression. So rather than deal with the problem, they ignore it. This has to stop. And it has to stop now.

It doesn’t matter how uncomfortable the conversation is. The growing tensions between the black and Jewish communities in New York, harkening back to the Crown Heights riots, must be dealt with. This will take real effort, and a commitment from leaders in the black community to educate and eradicate anti-Jewish bias.

Nobody wants to talk about this, but that’s just too bad. It has to be talked about before more Jews are killed. There is no bigger story than this in the five boroughs and its adjacent communities. The war on Jews has to be ended. But before it can end, it must first be acknowledged.

The Media Is Lying About The Attacks On The Embassy In Baghdad,"You can tell that the Obama administration’s legacy in the Middle East is in danger because the media, as the self-appointed janitors of that legacy, have gone into overdrive obfuscating the timing, context, and significance of this week’s attack on the United States embassy in Baghdad. Although President Donald Trump has gone a long way to dismantling Obama’s legacy in the region, much more remains to be done, including a halt to American taxpayer money that has been flowing into Iranian-controlled governments in Iraq and Lebanon.

Earlier this week Iran-backed militias stormed the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, chanting “Down, down USA!” and hurling water bottles and smashing security cameras. The attackers breached parts of the embassy and were only dispersed the next day, after Trump deployed Marines to ensure the safety of our embassy personnel and property.

The attacks have been building for months, including roughly a dozen attacks on U.S. assets by these militias and American retaliatory strikes against five locations in Iraq and Syria belonging to the Iranian-backed Kata’ib Hezbollah. The group represents an ongoing replication of the “Islamic revolutionary model” that Iran first “exported” to and “perfected” in Lebanon in the early 1980s.

The New York Times has labeled the attackers “mourners” responding to the U.S. strikes, while the front page of the first Washington Post edition of 2020 labeled them “protesters.” The latter is a particularly pernicious mislabeling. The media has done its best to conflate the attacks with anti-Iran protests that have been happening across Iraq for the last three months, but of course those actual protesters are pro-Iraqi sovereignty demonstrators fed up with the corruption and the broad perception that the Iraqi government is controlled by Iran.

Confirming exactly that accusation, the Iraqi government has repeatedly attacked the anti-Iran protesters, killing hundreds and wounding thousands, while giving a free pass and ready access to the Iran-backed fighters who stormed our embassy.

The media’s goal is to characterize the protests as a wholesale rejection of Trump’s policies in the region, hence the wall-to-wall disinformation about mourning and protesting. What’s actually at stake is Obama’s legacy. The Iran Deal was a bargain in which Iran would be handed control over the Middle East in exchange for some temporary limitations on nuclear activities.

As Obama said, the Saudis — by which he meant Sunnis across the region — would just have to learn to “share the neighborhood” with Iran. The attack on our embassy shows what sharing the region actually means, and the anti-Iran Iraqi protesters are saying they reject it.

Trump has partially withdrawn from the Iran deal, and Tehran is feeling the pressure. Behnam Ben Taleblu, a scholar from the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington, recently said the “Death to America” chants are a “dead giveaway” that these protests are being orchestrated by Iran as an effort to shore up its position. “These are pro-Iran and pro-militia sympathizers that appear to be out of touch with the thousands of Iraqis who have been chanting ‘Iran, out!’”

Other parts of Obama’s legacy, however, persist. One of the most glaring in the aftermath of the attack on our embassy is that we continue to pour money into countries like Iraq and Lebanon that are outright dominated by the mullahs in Iran through proxies like the Hezbollah militias in those countries.

Inside the administration, Trump loyalists have sought to cut that aid the Deep State has rushed in to preserve those policies. In Congress, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) recently sent around a two-page bill titled the “Stop Sending American Taxpayer Money to Governments Controlled by Terrorists Act.” The bill smartly proposed halting assistance to any Lebanese administration that is improperly influenced by Hezbollah.

Cruz’s bill should be expanded to include any government that is under Iranian control, not just Lebanon, as Iran has made attempts to establish proxy regimes in Syria, Yemen, and Iraq. Given Iran is interested in expanding its hegemony in the region by reproducing the Islamic Revolution in neighboring countries, there is no realm in which American aid should facilitate such activities.

Cruz’s proposal, and likewise an expansion of it, would amount to a full condemnation of what Foundation for the Defense of Democracies’ Tony Badran has labeled the Obama Realignment Doctrine, or. Obama’s strategy to restore a power “balance” in the Middle East by empowering Iran and disfavoring our long-term allies. Such an approach achieved its heyday in the Iran Deal and its repudiation in Trump’s withdrawal.

For those on the left, the current desire to salvage the remnants of Obama’s legacy has come at the expense of revealing the true nature of Iraqi unrest. It’s not only irresponsible but further reveals the level of perpetual dishonesty needed to sustain popular support (or at minimum, acceptance) of the Iran Deal. If your strategy requires lying to justify its existence, perhaps it’s not such a fantastic approach.

'Ringleader' Of U.S. Embassy Attack Was Invited To Obama White House,"The media has gone through great lengths to run cover for President Obama’s legacy in the Middle East, which President Trump has taken apart, much to the chagrin of the national security establishment, who wagered their careers on Obama’s dubious realignment strategy. Dubbed the Obama Realignment Doctrine by Tony Badran of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, the crux of Obama’s approach to dealing with the growing threat of Iranian hegemony in the Middle East was essentially to empower the world’s largest state sponsor of terror to limit its appetite for proxy wars.

We are just beginning to learn of the depth of such appeasement. Photos recently surfaced indicating that one of the three “ringleaders” of the Iran-backed attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad earlier this week was invited to the Obama White House less than a decade ago. Hadi al Amiri was serving as Iraq’s minister of transport when he joined Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki for his visit with President Obama in November 2011. The U.K. news site The Daily Mail has reproduced photos of the encounter here.

Even at the time of the visit, al Amiri’s presence in the White House stunned government officials. Lawmakers and FBI director Louise Freeh expressed consternation and shock that Obama would allow the Iraqi minister into the White House, even under diplomatic pretenses.

Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who was serving as chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee at the time of al Amiri’s White House visit, had shared with The Washington Times that it was “extremely disturbing that the White House would see fit to welcome Al-Amiri to a discussion on the future of Iraq.” The congresswoman said his visit would be better served in the form of an interrogation by the FBI and other U.S. counterterrorism organs.

Meanwhile, Freeh cited al Amiri’s involvement with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the military wing of the Iranian regime and a group designated a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department just last year. According to Freeh, al Amiri was embroiled in “countless acts of terrorism, which are acts of war against the United States.” Nonetheless, President Obama invited the terrorist to set foot in the White House.

Al Amiri’s infamous rap sheet also includes shipping weapons to Bashar al Assad during the Syrian civil war, in which Assad engaged in a vicious crackdown against his own people. Gen. James Mattis, former U.S. secretary of defense, told The Daily Mail that Iraqi help was instrumental in resuscitating Assad’s regime early in the war.

Currently, al Amiri is serving as head of the Badr Corps, an Iranian vassal within Iraq’s state-sanctioned Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) that, despite aiding the United States in the fight against ISIS in 2014 and 2015, has received sizeable funding, munition, and training assistance from the IRGC. The Badr Corps consist of thousands of pro-Iranian military figures and was at one point the military wing of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), a Shi’ite resistance group operating in opposition to the Iraq’s Sunni majority.

As of late, al Amiri has collaborated closely with the Iranian government in squashing recent protests against the corruption of the Iraqi government. Contrary to reporting at The New York Times, the Iraqi protestors of the last three months were victimized at the hands of demonstrators who breached the U.S. embassy earlier this week. But this geopolitical quandry was never fully explored by The New York Times because doing so would mean admitting that Obama had emboldened and empowered the wrong actors.

Indeed, al Amiri’s visit to the White House – and later apparent attack on the U.S. embassy – underscores precisely the abysmal failure of the Obama administration’s approach vis-à-vis Iran. As Seth Frantzman at the Jerusalem Post noted, Iraqi PM al Maliki was regarded as “Iraq’s hope for the future,” but instead, “his rule led to the rise of ISIS and the collapse of Iraq.”

Similarly, al Amiri was entertained by the Obama administration despite the concerns of U.S. officials and unsurprisingly, is now expected to be the linchpin in converting the PMU to the Iraqi rendition of IRGC. It’s hard to overstate how categorically miscalculated, grossly naive, and ultimately nefarious the Obama realignment truly was.

Right now, the media, along with the remnants of the Iran deal echo chamber, are doing their best to minimize discussion of Obama’s appeasement of Tehran, squirming stupidly at the sight of the very actors Obama propped up storming the U.S. embassy less than a decade later. Despite artful messaging, the Iran deal was never anything more than American acceptance of the Iranian “Islamic Revolution” – made possible by a wholesale pivot away from the United States’s Sunni allies and Israel – in exchange for superficial and ineffective limitations on Iran’s nuclear development.

As revealed by the recent attack on the U.S. embassy, the era of Iranian appeasement, rebranded as “power balancing,” is over.

Dems Hate Trump More Than They Hate Terrorists Who Kill Americans,"A U.S. airstrike killed the world’s most violent and deadliest terrorist of the last 20 years on Thursday night, but in the eyes of 2020 Democratic candidates and lefty celebrities, the only important takeaway from this American victory is that President Trump is bad.

Trump’s authorization of the killing of Iranian Revolutionary Guard terrorist leader Qasem Soleimani is a vindication for the thousands of wounded veterans, many with missing limbs from Soleimani’s IED attacks, and the families of U.S. servicemembers Soleimani killed. Soleimani approved the Tuesday attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and was plotting to kill more Americans. He was a central connection between Iran and terrorist organizations, including Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Palestinian Hamas. Yet some Democrats find it difficult to celebrate his death.

Despite the fact that Soleimani’s death will save American lives, Sen. Cory Booker said on MSNBC it is Trump who is “making the world less of a safe place.” Within an hour of the news of Soleimani’s death on Thursday, Booker appeared on CNN asserting that Trump, “has had really a failure in his Iranian policy.”

Although it was President Obama who shipped $150 billion in cash to Iran, emboldening terrorists like Soleimani, Booker is convinced that under the Trump administration, “Iran has become more influential and more dangerous.”

Democratic presdiential candidate Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, released a statement bemoaning the “serious questions about how this decision was made.”

Statement from @PeteButtigieg on killing of Qassim Soleimani: pic.twitter.com/9k2tSEiPu6 — Chris Meagher (@chrismeagher) January 3, 2020

From the sound of Buttigieg’s promise to “ask the hard questions” as president, it seems as if he might have bypassed killing Soleimani given the chance, thus allowing the potential deaths of more Americans at Soleimani’s hands.

Additionally, Buttigieg insinuates that Trump’s decision without congressional authority was unlawful. This is false. As David French pointed out on Twitter, because American troops are lawfully in Iraq, the airstrike was duly authorized, justified, and in no need of congressional authorization.

Democratic presidential candidates and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders also bypassed this opportunity to praise Trump for the successful take-out of the world’s most dangerous terrorist, and instead focused only on ginning up concern that Trump has started World War III in Iran.

In a tweet, Warren wailed, “Now he’s assassinated a senior foreign military official,” as if this was the assignation of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and not of a terrorist who was actively targeting the United States and has himself authorized an act of war against the United States in supporting the attack on a U.S. embassy.

Donald Trump ripped up an Iran nuclear deal that was working. He’s repeatedly escalated tensions. Now he’s assassinated a senior foreign military official. He’s been marching toward war with Iran since his first days in office—but the American people won’t stand for it. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 3, 2020

Sanders opted to ignore the news of the drone strike completely, and to instead talk about his past anti-war protests and to assure his supporters he would prevent the non-existent war in Iran.

I was right about Vietnam. I was right about Iraq. I will do everything in my power to prevent a war with Iran. I apologize to no one. pic.twitter.com/Lna3oBZMKB — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) January 3, 2020

Watching Sanders’ Senate Hall video, one would think Trump had indeed just declared war in Iran. In fact, just the opposite is true. As Daniel McCarthy writes in The Spectator, “Donald Trump was elected to put Washington’s emphasis back on the well-being of Americans, rather than on the imperial politics of the Middle East. A war with Iran would be a betrayal of his mandate — a war that would lead to other wars and more prolonged occupation of the region.” A targeted retaliatory strike is not the same as war. It could in fact prevent it by raising the stakes to Iran’s continued challenge to U.S. interests.

Former Vice President Joe Biden also released a statement full of false claims.

My statement on the killing of Qassem Soleimani. pic.twitter.com/4Q9tlLAYFB — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) January 3, 2020

Biden says Trump owes Americans a “strategy and plan to keep safe our troops and embassy personnel.” This is odd considering the killing of Soleimani will quite literally save the lives of troops and Americans in the embassies Soleimani had planned attacks on. In comparison, the Obama-Biden administration responded to attacks on a U.S. embassy and the death of a U.S. ambassador by lying about what had happened and arresting a YouTuber who after imprisonment ended up in a homeless shelter for exercising his free speech.

Biden claims Trump’s goal of deterring future attacks from Iran “certainly will have the opposite effect.” As John Davidson writes in The Federalist, “Trump hasn’t started a war with Iran. Rather, it means the United States has recognized and responded to a conflict that’s been going on for some time now, and that Iran has fueled. If anything, the Suleimani strike might well prevent the outbreak of a new Mideast war that was looking increasingly inevitable after eight years of the Obama administration’s feckless foreign policy.”

Another 2020 Democrat candidate, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, falsely claimed Trump had acted without congressional authority.

Not only did Democrats dismiss the fact that no man on earth was more directly responsible for the deaths of American soldiers, I would be remiss to leave out the outspoken leftist celebrities who undoubtedly had never heard of Qasem Soleimani before Thursday. In a puzzling tweet featuring an Iranian flag with emojis on it, actress Rose McGowen said Americans are actually the ones “being held hostage by a terrorist regime.”

https://twitter.com/rosemcgowan/status/1212976832544460801

“Thanks a lot, d–khead,” McGowan wrote to Trump in another tweet.

https://twitter.com/rosemcgowan/status/1212977622994636800

Actor John Cusack tweeted the insightful analysis that attacking Iran is bad because the country is “not like anywhere else.”

Trump in full fascist 101 mode-,steal and lie – untill there’s nothing left and start a war –

He’s so idiotic he doesn’t know he just attacked Iran

And that’s not like anywhere else — John Cusack (@johncusack) January 3, 2020

Reactions from Democrats were more than predictable, given how Trump Derrangment Syndrome has plagued their minds since 2016. But when American lives have clearly been saved and other lives already lost are clearly avenged by this terrorist’s death, it’s disappointing that not one Democrat could give the Trump administration some credit without fear-mongering about World War III.

People Who Play The Antisemitism Blame Game Are Part Of The Problem,"A rash of violent antisemitic attacks carried out by black Americans throughout December was an important reminder that by focusing on white supremacist antisemitism, Americans have neglected the spectrum of anti-Jewish hate at work in our society.

On Dec. 10, a black man and woman in Jersey City killed four in a kosher supermarket. Jews were targeted in eight attacks in New York City between Dec. 23 and 27, during the celebration of Hanukkah. Of four known perpetrators, three were black. On Dec. 28, Grafton Thomas, a black man who held antisemitic beliefs, used a large machete to stab five Hasidic Jews at a Hanukkah lighting celebration in Rockland County, New York.

After Thomas’ attack, leaders such as Rev. Al Sharpton, President Donald Trump, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo expressed support for the Jewish community and called for an increased understanding of how to combat antisemitic hate from all sources.

Even New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who did little to combat the 63 percent increase in antisemitic attacks in his city throughout 2019, reacted to the Hanukkah attacks by deploying police personnel to protect the Jewish population.

Still others blamed the series of heinous antisemitic acts on President Trump and white supremacists. Among these were Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who previously blamed the Jersey City shootings on white supremacists in a now-deleted tweet. On Dec. 29, she blamed the president for the atmosphere in which hatred, including antisemitism, is rising.

Tlaib’s remarks fail to address the left-wing politicians, media figures, and Hollywood stars who have played a significant role in stoking hate in America. Among these, Tlaib is a recurring figure.

More importantly, unless Trump is also to blame for the increase of antisemitism around the globe, including in the U.K., Germany, Denmark, Poland, Belgium, Sweden, Austria, France, Australia, and Canada, Tlaib’s diagnosis is incorrect and minimizes a dangerous trend.

NBC fact-checker Erin Biba directed blame at a different source. Her misguided take on Thomas’s antisemitic attack lamented a “massively complicated” environment and “growing division among two communities” in New York. Ultimately, she advised Americans to unite in solidarity “against our shared enemy of white supremacy.”

Backlash against her attempt to provide cover for antisemitism and blame Thomas’ attack on white supremacy was swift. Biba deleted the tweet and ultimately deleted her Twitter account.

Distracting from the Problem

When Tlaib and Biba attempt to divert attention from the many-faced crisis of antisemitism, they stall the process of understanding and addressing this pernicious hatred.

American antisemitism emanates from varied sources. Recent anti-Israel protests on college campuses have left Jewish students fearing violence. A boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement protest in 2019 led to vandalism against and antisemitic harassment of one of Tlaib’s constituents, a Lebanese American Muslim business owner in Dearborn, Michigan.

Since 2018, white nationalists carried out deadly attacks on synagogues in Pittsburgh and California. In 2019, black Americans carried out one deadly and several atrocious but nonlethal attacks in the Northeast. Rather than some transient dislike, antisemitism is a deeply and firmly held hatred upon which its believers often feel compelled to act. This potent anti-Jewish hate has been tailored to the needs of many groups seeking a scapegoat for disenchantment with their lot in life.

Conspiracy theorist antisemites blame Jews for orchestrating the 9/11 attacks, starting the institution of American slavery, and perpetrating evils against the black community through gentrification and police brutality. They allege Jews are working to supplant the white race and control the media, internet, discourse, banks, and weather.

Antisemites spew a host of contrary ideas about the Holocaust, stating Jews manufactured and even exploited the period of Nazi mass murder. Some admit Jews died during the Holocaust but believe these deaths occurred on a small scale through exposure and starvation rather than through the systematic extermination of 6 million Jews, two-thirds of the European Jewish population.

To the detriment of Jews around the world, the Jewish state of Israel is often called an apartheid state with Nazi-esque policies and the powers to hypnotize other actors on the world stage.

When this kind of bile leads people to commit violent attacks against Jews, antisemites have the gall to blame Jews for their own assaults and deaths. Without a swift move to fully understand and address the various forms antisemitism has taken in America, this terrible hatred will only filter further into the populace.

Uniting to Protect Jews

Antisemitism has been on the rise in America for years, and with each new attack, the left and right bicker about whose side is to blame for the escalation. Meanwhile, American Jews bear the brunt of our collective inability to unite against antisemitism.

In a survey from October, the American Jewish Committee found that 31 percent of American Jewish respondents now avoid wearing “symbols or objects identifying them as Jews.” This is not an atypical response. In a recent Atlantic article, Holocaust scholar Deborah Lipstadt notes how Jews around the world have gone underground with their religious identity.

Their distinctive style of dress renders Orthodox Jews highly visible, however. Unable to blend in, they have been the targets in most of the attacks in New York City in 2019. In late December, signs were posted around St. Albans, Vermont, which read “its [sic] okay to be anti-Semitic.” In response, the Simon Wiesenthal Center tweeted an important reminder on Dec. 29: “Jews cannot defeat antisemitism. Only our neighbors can.”

The current environment of antisemitism is unacceptable, but it cannot be diminished without concerted, unified efforts. It is past time for Americans to come together and understand the nature and effects of antisemitism at home and abroad. Those who react to antisemitic attacks by playing the blame game are standing in the way of a solution at best. At worst, they are part of the problem.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/01/03/people-who-play-the-antisemitism-blame-game-are-part-of-the-problem/,2020-01-03
The Killing Of Qassem Suleimani Is A Reminder That Iran Is Weak,"The first thing to say about the U.S. airstrike on Thursday night that killed Qassem Suleimani, the longtime leader of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps’ Quds Force, is that President Trump made the right decision.

Taking out Suleimani, who was killed as he traveled in a convoy near the Baghdad airport, was long overdue. In a statement, the Pentagon said Suleimani “was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region,” and blamed him for orchestrating recent attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq, including a December 27 attack that killed a U.S. government contractor and the attacks on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad this week. In addition, he was responsible for attacks that have killed hundreds of U.S. soldiers in Iraq and elsewhere, and his Quds Force directed terror campaigns and operations throughout the region.

The importance of this strike can’t be overstated. In the hierarchy of the Iranian regime, Suleimani is more powerful than Iran’s president when it comes to foreign policy. He and the Quds Force, which conducts terror operations, assassinations, and bombings outside Iran, report directly to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Suleimani controlled billions of dollars in terror financing across the globe. His killing marks a major escalation with Tehran that’s been a long time coming, and likely marks a new era in U.S.-Iranian relations.

The conventional wisdom seems to be that we should expect Iran to retaliate. Khamenei has already promised revenge, which will probably take the form of covert actions or terror operations rather than, say, missile launches. But it’s also possible that Iran’s retaliation won’t amount to much. For all its bluster and pernicious meddling in the region, Tehran is weak, and being weak, it is vulnerable to the use of force.

What Operation Praying Mantis Can Teach Us Today

There’s strong historical precedent for using force to pacify Iran. The only thing that has really chastened Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution was Operation Praying Mantis in April 1988, in which U.S. forces sunk or severely damaged about half of Iran’s navy. Iran had been at war with Iraq for eight years, and in 1987 began attacking oil tankers and mining the Persian Gulf. When the guided missile frigate USS Samuel B. Roberts struck a mine while on a convoy mission to protect reflagged Kuwaiti oil tankers from Iranian attacks, it blew an immense hole in the ship’s hull and nearly sank it.

In response, the U.S. Navy launched Operation Praying Mantis, the largest U.S. surface engagement since the Second World War and the first and only time the time the U.S. Navy has exchanged surface-to-surface missile fire with an enemy. The U.S. struck Iranian warships and oil platforms with coordinated assaults from groups of warships and aircraft from the carrier USS Enterprise, destroying two oil platforms and sinking at least three Iranian speedboats, one Iranian frigate, and one fast attack gunboat, as well as severely damaging one other Iranian frigate. The U.S. lost a single helicopter gunship that crashed attempting to evade enemy fire. The whole thing was over in a day.

The success of Operation Praying Mantis, as well as a crushing defeat that same day against Iraqi forces on the al-Faw peninsula, pushed Iranian leadership toward a ceasefire with Iraq later that summer, ending the eight-year conflict. It wasn’t sanctions or the promise of restored diplomatic relations with the U.S. that persuaded Iran to back down, it was the sinking of Iranian ships by U.S. forces in what amounted to an overwhelming battlefield domination on the world stage.

Killing Suleimani Is More Likely To Prevent A War Than Start One

Contrary to the hand-wringing of some liberal media outlets in the wake of the Suleimani strike, President Trump hasn’t started a war with Iran. Rather, it means the United States has recognized and responded to a conflict that’s been going on for some time now, and that Iran has fueled. If anything, the Suleimani strike might well prevent the outbreak of a new Mideast war that was looking increasingly inevitable after eight years of the Obama administration’s feckless foreign policy.

The airstrike itself should be uncontroversial, despite the craven protests of some Democrats now defending Iran. As David French explained on Twitter, the strike was duly authorized, justified, and needed no separate congressional authorization. “American troops are lawfully in Iraq—there by congressional authorization and with the permission of the Iraqi government. Moreover, they have a right of self-defense.”

In any case, the parallel between the killing of Suleimani and Operation Praying Mantis in 1988 is straightforward. If you mine the Persian Gulf and nearly sink a U.S. warship, the United States will destroy your navy. Likewise, if you plan and execute attacks against U.S. troops and outposts, the United States will take out the man behind those attacks with an airstrike.

In 1988, that was the takeaway for Tehran, whose burning ships and oil platforms testified above all to America’s military might and resolve. Faced with more of the same, Iran backed down. Today, faced with the prospect that its top terrorists and military commanders could at any time be taken out by U.S. forces, perhaps Tehran will reconsider its current course and back down once again.

If that’s Iran’s takeaway from the Suleimani strike, then it will have been well worth it.

Trump Derangement Prevents Media From Praising Trump For Iranian Terrorist Soleimani’s Demise,"According to reports confirmed by both the Pentagon and the Iranian government, Major General Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Quds Force within Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), was killed in an attack by US Forces on Baghdad airport Friday morning. Soleimani was Iran’s top commander and arguably the second-most powerful man within the regime, behind Ayatollah Khamenei. You would suspect that Soleimani’s death, or the death of any terrorist commander, would be received with cautious optimism. But in the case of our media and their mindless antipathy to Trump, such expectations must be suspended.

It would be hard to overstate the significance of Soleimani’s death. As the Pentagon announced following his death, he and his Quds Force “were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more.” Soleimani orchestrated the recent attacks on U.S. bases within Iraq, including the one on December 27 in which an American contractor was killed. Soleimani also greenlighted the attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad this past week, which involved the defacement of the compound at the hands of Iran-backed protesters and Iraqi militias.

It’s worth noting that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo designated the IRGC a foreign terrorist organization last year, the group joining the infamous ranks of nearly 70 others, including Hamas, Hezbollah, and ISIS. “The IRGC is the Iranian government’s primary means of directing and implementing its global terrorist campaign,” Trump stated.

The IRGC, through highly specialized and secretive Quds Force, offers massive support to terrorists globally in the form of material aid, training, technology transfer, guidance, and direction, thus ensuring that Iran remains the world’s largest state sponsor of terror. In no short order, the IRGC continues to prop up its Islamic Revolution terrorist proxies throughout the Middle East, including but not limited to, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, Kata’ib Hezbollah in Iraq, and Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza.

According to the State Department, Soleimani’s Quds Forces plotted a terrorist attack against the Saudi Arabian Ambassador on American soil in 2011 that was luckily foiled. And in 2018, Iran and the IRGC were found liable in U.S. federal court for the 1996 Khobar Towers Bombing which resulted in the loss of 19 American lives. In recent years, it is no surprise that many countries have encountered and thwarted terrorist plots orchestrated by IRGC.

Given the indisputable terrorist activities of IRGC, with Soleimani at the helm, it would seem that celebrating his death would come naturally, in the same way that commentators on both sides of the aisle expressed relief and joy that Osama bin Laden had finally been captured and killed in 2011. According to the Pentagon, at the time of his death, Soleimani was in the process of planning future attacks on Americans diplomats and service members currently in the region, his death being treated as a means of foiling those plans and possibly deterring future ones from taking shape.

But reactions to the killing from media talking heads were predictably pathetic, given that they immediately assume the direct opposite of Trump’s position on any given issue, no matter the level of intellectual gymnastics such maneuvers require.

Unsurprisingly, Trump’s targeted killing of the terrorist leader has been deemed a litany of unseemly adjectives, including “reckless” and “incoherent.” Perhaps the most breathtakingly stupid reaction has been the notion that this attack somehow represented the first strike or an “act of war,” as if Iran and its proxies had not been targeting U.S. bases, seizing control of oil tankers, and laying siege on our embassy in Baghdad these last few months.

foreign policy specialists now bracing for US-Iran war after killing of Soleimani former Bush national security official Richard Haass: “If US behind the strike, then Iran will almost certainly go after US personnel in Iraq and elsewhere. This could spread and escalate fast” — John Harwood (@JohnJHarwood) January 3, 2020

Imagine the Iranian government assassinated Mike Pompeo with a drone, at the direction of the president, and called it self defense. That’s exactly what the US did by killing Soleimani — an act of war. The only difference is Iran’s self defense claims would be more legitimate. — Emma Vigeland (@EmmaVigeland) January 3, 2020

But there’s been a strange movement within the media to humanize the terrorist Soleimani. The Washington Post issued an alert last night, labeling the Iranian commander to be “Iran’s most revered military leader,” a far, ahistorical cry from the facts, which indicate that much of Iran is hugely upset with the regime’s expansionist and violent aims. Any reporter with knowledge of the region would recognize that there is a tremendous divide between the ambitions of Iran’s mullahs and the desires of the Iranian people.

The Washington Post was not alone. In the wee hours of Friday morning, a New York Times journalist tweeted a video of Soleimani reading poetry “about friends departing & him being left behind.” A former writer at the Intercept, Vice, and Salon compared the killing of Soleimani to the killing of Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, and Captain America “all in one.”

A CBS report on Friday referred to the Soleimani as both a “revered figure” and a “war hero.”

Given the geopolitical complexity of the region, reactions to Soleimani’s death demand nuance. But before any analysis can begin, we should as a society be able to agree that his death was justifiable. During the Obama years, our foreign policy was structured on placating terrorists in some fashion, so much so that Obama tipped off the Iranians to an Israeli plot to kill Soleimani years ago. Given, inter alia, Trump’s partial withdrawal from the Iran Deal, the FTO designation of the IRGC, and the recent killing of Soleimani, that approach seems to no longer be the case.

As Michael Doran writes, “The decision to kill Mr. Suleimani represents the final demise of Mr. Obama’s Middle East strategy, which sought to realign American interests with those of Iran.” It seems the media is not only mourning the death of Soleimani, but the death of Obama’s legacy, a reaction which may explain their incoherent and emotionally fueled “analysis.” Determining what comes next is important. But acknowledging that a purely evil person was killed—and offering due credit to the Trump administration for his death—should not be so categorically challenging.

Trump’s Strike On Soleimani Is Not Reckless Interventionism,"On New Year’s Eve, Iran-backed militias attempted to storm the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, engaging in an unsuccessful act of war as American forces secured the compound. In the aftermath, President Trump warned Iran that it would “be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities,” and “pay a very BIG PRICE. This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy New Year!”

Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei shot back, “You can’t do anything.” A day later, President Trump did something.

His decision to strike Qassem Soleimani was a game-changing act with immense substantive and symbolic implications. It finally brought a modicum of justice for the hundreds of Americans murdered and thousands injured at the hands of the head of the terrorist Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, his henchmen, and their proxies.

It took off the battlefield a genocidal military mastermind responsible for spreading Iran’s Islamic Revolution globally, constructing its Shiite Crescent in the Middle East, and threatening America and our allies at home and abroad.

It represented a decisive response to Iran’s act of war in Baghdad, as well as its repeated assaults on Iraqi coalition bases including last month’s rocket attack that killed one American and injured several others, and additional imminent strikes for which Soleimani would have been responsible. It was about putting America first.

This Isn’t Another Afghanistan (Yet)

Critics of the Trump administration are claiming that this operation—which also resulted in the death of Hezbollah Brigades leader and Iraq Popular Mobilization Forces deputy leader Abu Mahdi al Muhandis, and may have coincided with the rumored rolling up of other Iran-backed militia leaders—recklessly risked all-out war with Iran.

The assumption among both leftist Trump haters and anti-interventionist Trump supporters like Tucker Carlson is that the United States could well be drawn into a broader conflict that will lead to another Iraq or Afghanistan, replete with a full-scale invasion and occupation. Yet this would conflict with President Trump’s word, deed, and demonstrated instinct, and almost assuredly the desires of his supporters.

These critics are missing a number of other crucial points. First, Iran has been at war with the United States since 1979, when it stormed our embassy in Tehran and took Americans hostage. The presumed alternative to the Trump administration’s Iran policy, namely the Iran nuclear deal, was not an alternative to war, but the continuation of war by other means—a ruse built on collusion with a willing Obama administration seeking to make Iran the strong horse in the Middle East, and greedy and fearful European partners that enabled the mullocracy to expand under the veneer of a Swiss cheese “verification regime.”

Aside from facing on-again off-again economic sanctions, the world’s leading state sponsor of jihad has paid very little price for the blood it has shed. It has tapped along the West while spreading its influence globally, developing its military capabilities including its nuclear program, and acting against America and our allies.

The storming of the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, in which attackers spray-painted references to Soleimani on walls and windows, along with Soleimani’s openly traversing the Middle East and beyond, reflected a level of hubris that may well have proved to be his downfall. Now Iran knows that America is fully engaged, unconstrained by politically correct rules of engagement, and no longer acting out of fear or willfully blind delusions about bribing a jihadist regime into peace. It knows it will pay a severe price should it endanger Americans, a price that yesterday it would not have anticipated. The strength of this deterrent both psychologically and materially cannot be easily dismissed.

This Is Retaliation, Not Provocation

Second, the expressly stated purpose of the attack on Soleimani was deterrence, not a prelude to invasion. Attacking a U.S. embassy is again an act of war, and the U.S. responded in kind if not disproportionately given Soleimani’s existential importance to the mullocratic regime.

Such an act should be seen not as an attempt to enter a war that President Trump has never desired, but to prevent Iran from even thinking about dramatically escalating towards one given the overwhelming, catastrophic response it now knows it could face. This is even before considering how Israel or anti-Iranian Sunni Arab nations would respond in such a scenario. The killing of Soleimani should have changed the strategic calculation of Iran’s leaders.

Third, for those fearing a greater war, the Trump administration has acted with substantial restraint with respect to the Iranian regime, slowly and methodically ramping up economic pressure while speaking of a desire for diplomacy. It has avoided direct military action to the point when American assets and then lives were repeatedly threatened, and now shown that any such attacks will be met with overwhelming force—force directed at the head of the snake, not merely at proxies that could needlessly bog America down. These are prudent acts, not the acts of a president who wants to dive headlong into the kind of engagement he ran against.

Defending the National Interest

President Trump has demonstrated not an interest in war, but in ensuring peace through strength and the resolute defense of America’s national interest against those who threaten it. As for fear over escalation, it bears noting that the administration presumably has been prepared for this day for some time.

More than two years ago, then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo revealed he had delivered a letter to Soleimani and Iranian leaders indicating “we will hold he and Iran accountable for any attacks on American interests in Iraq by forces that are under their control.” Presumably, the Trump administration has had contingency plans ready to go for some time in the event Soleimani met his demise.

Again, the question analysts should be asking themselves today is not whether the United States is ready for a counter-attack, but rather what kind of counter-attack Iran is really prepared to launch knowing what has just transpired.

Fourth, continued appeasement of Iran would have invited more aggression and left America worse off in the future. Iran certainly poses a danger. Its malevolent agents have been operating in our backyard and on our own soil. Terror cells could ostensibly carry out attacks against the homeland. America could be subjected to devastating cyber-attacks.

There are obviously numerous ways Iran could retaliate against American forces and assets in the Middle East. But the very reason Iran has the capability to inflict such damage is precisely because of the policies of appeasement America has undertaken for decades. In other words, just as there are potentially major costs to action, there have too been major costs to inaction.

Should the answer be to throw up our hands and allow Iran to continue its march unimpeded, or to show that there will be grave consequences? The irony is that those now hysterical in adamantly arguing that President Trump’s strike is going to lead to a massive conflagration in the Middle East were directly responsible for aiding, abetting, and enabling Iran to such an extent that it could pose such a threat.

President Obama and apparently his potential Democratic successors who wish to return to the Iran Deal believe in bribing enemies to buy (false) peace. The Trump administration believes the way to peace is by taking enemies off the battlefield.

Iran Is In No Condition to Strike Back Hard

Fifth, the U.S. strike on Soleimani has further destabilized a mullocratic regime that is today more vulnerable than in the last decade—and now without its chief military strategist. It is facing resistance to its influence in Iraq, Lebanon, and on its own streets. It is mired in proxy wars. It has been losing assets to Israeli strikes. Its economy is languishing under the pressure of crippling U.S. sanctions.

That the regime has resorted to slaughtering dissidents at home and abroad indicates it is lashing out from desperation rather than strength—doing everything in its power to hold onto and consolidate the gains it made under the Bush and Obama administrations. The Iranian regime now finds itself facing battles on any number of fronts.

While this makes Iran’s response to the killing of Soleimani more unpredictable and perhaps dangerous, Iran’s leaders need to be asking themselves whether they really want to get into a full-scale war with the United States knowing how shaky their present position is. Destabilization of the regime, in other words, should be considered on balance a good thing.

An Assassination Heard Around the World

Trump’s critics also ignore the broader symbolic significance of the strike on Soleimani. Not just Iran but every adversary that threatens American servicemen or civilians will have to think more than twice after a player as crucial as Soleimani was taken off the board.

Every adversary that threatens American servicemen or civilians will have to think more than twice after a player as crucial as Soleimani was taken off the board.

The message the United States sent is unequivocal: If threatened, we can and will take out anyone who poses a threat to our national interest at a time, place, and in a manner of our choosing. You can bet Kim Jong-Un has taken notice. You can also bet that he and other anti-American leaders are now internalizing that the Trump administration does not have infinite patience or tolerance for provocations.

More fundamentally, America is showing that once again it is acting out of strength, not fear. It is operating prudently and squarely in the U.S. national interest, not seeking to create Jeffersonian democracies in places hostile to them, or shrinking in fear when faced with aggression.

So, conservative populists such as Tucker Carlson are right to instinctively be skeptical of anything approximating foreign adventurism; to be weary of mission creep and the ways bureaucrats and businessmen may at times lead America to over-extension in ways manifestly antithetical to American national interest; to acknowledge that China poses the greatest threat to America of any other nation.

But Iran is the world’s leading state sponsor of jihad, and it too poses a threat to vital U.S. national interests, and those of our allies. When and where it threatens us, it must be countered. The strike on Soleimani is not about sparking World War III over the Iranian threat. It ought to be seen as an attempt to defuse it.

I Survived 12 Hours In Twitter Prison For Daring Iran To Attack America,"There is a scene towards the beginning of “Goodfellas” in which the young protagonist Henry Hill is arrested for the first time. After spending a few hours in the slammer, he emerges to find his mafia family waiting for him to celebrate. This was a coming of age moment, a gangster bar mitzvah.

Thus did I feel this morning when I awoke to find my 12-hour ban from Twitter had been lifted. How had I gotten myself into this mess, you ask? Well, it was a combination of bellicosity and poor syntax. I tweeted this:

If Iran attacks New York City it will be leveled. Plain and simple. I live here. Bring it on Ayatollah. — David Marcus (@BlueBoxDave) January 4, 2020

As to the bellicosity, I am of a firm mind that countries that attack American embassies should face military consequences. I am of an even firmer mind that countries that attack the American homeland should face abject devastation. What makes America the world’s only superpower is that everyone knows if they attack us they will be destroyed. That’s a good reputation to have.

As far as the syntax goes, some people, who were either morons or disingenuous, or disingenuous morons, seemed to think I meant it was New York that would be leveled. This is obviously an interpretation that makes less sense than a Fellini picture.

Others, whom I presume have never been to Brooklyn, took me to mean that I was earnestly hoping for an attack on New York by saying, “Bring it on.” Much like when Trump says he would love an impeachment trial in the Senate, the point is not that you really want it, but that if the other guy is stupid enough to do it, he’ll regret it. It’s a threat, not an invitation.

So, I was getting ratio’d and rather enjoying it when Molly Jong Fast, the most conservative writer at an outlet called The Bulwark, disapprovingly interacted with the tweet. I’d show you the tweet but she blocks me now. In any event, I suggested that she should, Jane Fonda-like, go to Iran and apologize for all of us. Some other user jumped in, and I reiterated my previous point with six words. “Bomb the f*** out of the them.”

Not much longer after that, I received word that I had been tried, convicted, and sentenced to a 12-hour ban from Twitter.com. I’m still not sure what policy I violated. I mean, the Iranian ambassador had been all over cable news promising violent revenge on the United States. Plenty of people were tweeting about it. How is that any different than promising Iran will become the largest pothole in the Middle East if it attacks America?

The worst part of the ban was that I could still see Twitter. It’s freakin’ torture. Everyone else was dunking on the Patriots for losing at home in the playoffs and there I sat like Richard II staring at the fun through the flinty ribs of my ragged prison walls. I felt muzzled, completely out of touch with the world. This strange, distant whisper seemed to be saying, “You have friends, call one…” I’m still trying to figure out what this means.

I knew I had at least a few hours to suffer through my ban before I would go to bed. I was terrified, but then something magical happened. It turns out there are things in my apartment other than my phone, iPad, and computer. There were books and compact disks, a gaming system and jigsaw puzzles! I don’t actually own any jigsaw puzzles, but you get the point. For three precious hours, I was untethered from the Twitterverse, bathed in the holy light of uncompromised reality. It was thrilling. Then I went to bed.

As you may well imagine, it was a difficult sleep, filled with night terrors, tremors, and a drenching sweat. What tweets had I missed? What clever comments and GIFs of sad Tom Brady? Sadly, we will never know.

But as the good Charles Bukowski used to say, in the morning it was morning, and I was still alive. I grasped for my phone, and saw that my ban had been lifted. Just to be sure, I fired off a tweet. As if to pinch myself, I informed my followers, including the 300 new ones, that now I was back Iran could still go f*** itself. And there it appeared, chiseled in 21st-century stone, its image popping up on screens throughout the world! I was back, baby!

And I want you all to know that I am chastened. I am a wiser man. I see now that my tweeting had been far too tame. How did it take me this long to get banned? When I was a kid in Philly we used to say that if an elected official hadn’t been indicted he wasn’t working hard enough. That’s how I feel now. And I promise to do better.

Attacks On Jews Are Canary In The Coalmine For Religious Liberty,"Imagine you’re in your home, surrounded by friends and family, peacefully celebrating your faith tradition’s most significant holiday. Suddenly an armed stranger enters and attempts to kill you and your guests—quite possibly because he hates your religion.

That nightmare became true just weeks ago in an American suburb, when a man wielding a machete forced his way into a Jewish rabbi’s home and attacked guests at a Hanukkah gathering in New York. This is not an isolated incident, either. In just one week in December, there were nine violent attacks on Jewish communities and individuals in America.

Let that sink in: Despite our country’s heritage of protecting and promoting religious liberty, our fellow Americans are daily being threatened and attacked because of their religious beliefs.

In an op-ed for CNN after the Hanukkah attack, Frida Ghitis wrote, “Anti-Semitism is a symptom of a larger societal problem. Sure, when Jews are unsafe, it is they who are most at risk, but Jews are the canary in the coalmine, an early warning sign of a community or a nation losing its moorings.”

So what larger societal problem are these attacks a symptom of? They are, quite simply, an indication that we in America have lost sight of the basic freedoms that our nation was founded upon—especially freedom of religion. We are perilously close to losing the vision of our nation as a place where people with different convictions can live side by side in peace and tolerance.

Identity Politics Coincides with Intolerance

Even as some have discarded the ideals of religious liberty and freedom of conscience, Americans have increasingly embraced the divisive and toxic ideology of identity politics, which pits groups against each other and drives people not towards tolerance, but towards discrimination and resentment.

In an interesting correlation, even as violence against religious minority groups escalates, fewer and fewer Americans identify as part of a religious community. This year, one survey found that for the first time, religious “nones”—people who identity with no religion—make up as large a segment of American society (23.1 percent) as evangelicals (22.5 percent) or Catholics (23 percent), the two largest religious groups. “Nones” are consciously disassociated from religion—and in its place, many of them have embraced identity politics.

Identity politics lumps people into particular political and social “tribes” based on fragments of their “identity” such as sex, race, and socioeconomic status. It then frames all political discussions in terms of “oppression,” with a hierarchy of tribes based on who claims to be most oppressed, and pits groups against each other in a struggle for power.

Rather than calling people to serve a higher authority and to serve others, no matter how different they are, it tries to blame one group’s problems on another group. This makes it very difficult for people to have empathy and understanding for individuals outside their groups.

Rather than Equal Treatment, Selective Outrage

Identity politics is all-consuming. It demands total loyalty from its followers, even if that means turning a blind eye to atrocities against members of other groups. During 2019, Jews suffered a heinous number of attacks, as documented by journalist David French. But, as French noted, “The wave of attacks don’t fit the story of our time.”

These attacks do not further the narrative of identity politics, so they receive very little media attention and generate little outrage—much less outrage than if a similar attack took place against another group with a higher rank in the current identity politics hierarchy. Consider these lines from “An Open Letter on Identity Politics, to and from the Left,” published in Medium in 2016: “all politics are identity politics. […] Viewpoints which attack ‘identity politics’ directly attack marginalized people. […] they are biased in favor of white, male, straight, Christian or cisgender people.”

It is not only religious “nones” who are susceptible to the resentment and divisiveness of identity politics. This toxic cultural movement has made it more difficult for every American, religious or non-religious alike, to engage with people who look or feel different than us. As a nation, we are becoming less tolerant. As the recent violence showed us, that puts people who hold unpopular views—like Orthodox Jews—in danger.

I’ll Tolerate You Only If You Agree With Me

Orthodox Jews encourage modesty, limit their exposure to popular culture, and hold traditional beliefs about marriage, gender, and sexuality. Orthodox Jews do not try to hide their convictions. They live their beliefs openly through their clothing, diet, and daily lives.

But in contemporary America, the hard reality is that living out our convictions can put religious people and communities at risk. The leftist culture-shapers who claim to champion “tolerance” and “ending discrimination” push for toxic identity politics that make true tolerance impossible.

The connection between leftism, which is entirely on board with identity politics, and antisemitism is not a new one. In 2017, Time published an article titled, “Anti-Semitism Is Creeping into Progressivism.” This past year, far-left politician Rep. Ilhan Omar made numerous openly antisemitic and anti-Israel comments but suffered no long-term political ramifications. Incredibly, Omar was even defended for her comments by members of her political party.

Time to Choose a Better Way

We are at a crossroads. One path follows the siren call of identity politics as it continues to pit us against each other, leading to a devastating loss of true freedom and tragic consequences for minorities. As French writes, “We should also understand that when the politics of the age becomes a politics of resentment, especially a conspiratorial politics of resentment—the story of what ‘they’ did to ‘us’—then history teaches us that radicals disproportionately identify ‘they’ as Jews.” This could be what we see happening right now—and, as Ghitis warns, intolerance against Jews indicates a much larger social problem.

Our human dignity and freedom of conscience comes from God, and it cannot be coerced by government.

But we can choose another path: one that leads towards a society of true tolerance, based in respect for our differences. True tolerance must always be rooted in respect, and that includes respect for those we do not understand and do not agree with, even if their beliefs offend us or make us uncomfortable.

This path towards a truly tolerant society is one that Americans have striven to walk since the founding of our nation. Even though we have stepped off of it time and time again, it is a path laid out for us in the Constitution and Bill of Rights, which guarantee protections for basic freedoms like freedom of religion.

The idea of true tolerance goes hand-in-hand with freedom of religion, because it springs from the religious idea that our human dignity and freedom of conscience comes from God, and that it cannot be coerced by government. That kind of freedom benefits the religious and non-religious and demands that we respect those whose faith is different from our own.

Freedom of Religion Is the True Tolerance

The recent string of violence against Jews brought to mind the first time I toured the Holocaust Museum in the early 1990s. I had never been confronted so graphically with the sweeping persecution that devastated the Jewish community during the 1930s and 1940s. That persecution began much earlier than the infamous concentration camps and employed much broader means.

We cannot survive as a culture if we do not respect people whose faith looks different from our own.

At the end of that museum tour I read Martin Niemoller’s lament that, because he had refused to stand for those outside of his own group, there was no one left to stand up for him. I remember thinking, “How did we not stop this?”

Today, we face a similar question. While we may be in a season where fewer people understand or adhere to religion, we cannot survive as a culture if we do not respect people whose faith looks different from our own. And we cannot allow this kind of violence to continue.

A quote attributed to Dietrich Bonhoeffer says it best: “Silence in the face of evil is evil itself.” We cannot remain silent; we cannot continue down this terrible road of intolerance, division, and violence. It is upon all of us to ensure that no one is prevented from living consistently with his time-honored beliefs in the public square simply because of how unpopular those beliefs may currently be.

"No, Trump’s Justifications For Soleimani Attack Aren’t Contradictory","A new narrative has emerged since the attack that killed terrorist Iranian leader Qasem Soleimani last week. Early reports indicated that the deadly mission was a response to the violent Iranian led attacks on the US embassy in Iraq. In the ensuing days the White House and State Department also announced that there was an imminent threat to Americans emanating from Soleimani.

Many in the news media pounced on this as an apparent contradiction, as if the two explanations were somehow mutually exclusive. Some Democrats have even gone so far as to question whether there was an imminent threat at all. By their logic, if the imminent threat really wasn’t imminent then the action to kill the Iranian leader would be less legitimate and potentially even illegal.

But this represents a misreading of how the recent military escalation by Iran is related to a threat assessment. These are not two separate things; in fact the uptick in Iranian actions is a vital part of determining whether an imminent threat exists. Intelligence is not a perfect science; analysts looked at a wide variety of evidence, from seized or overheard conversations, to informants, and also to the nature of the recent activity.

It is simply common sense that in assessing whether a country is likely to launch an attack that country’s recent military actions are a big clue regarding their readiness and willingness to do so. The embassy attack last week was just the latest in a string of incidents that included an attack on an air base that left an American contractor dead, as well an attack this summer on a US drone.

Each of these actions was bigger and bolder than the previous ones. In the case of the attack on the embassy, it alone would justify a military response, even if there was no imminent threat, or if the evidence of one does not seem convincing. Democrats demanding some public accounting of what exactly the threat was are playing a dangerous game. While Congress should and will be briefed by the White House, the risk of exposing assets and capabilities by making too much public is very real.

What’s really going on here is a common pattern throughout Trump’s presidency. He will do something that no previous presidents would, such as moving the embassy to Jerusalem or getting out of various accords, or using his authority to suspend aid to, oh I don’t’ know, Ukraine for example. Then Democrats and the media decide that his actions are so abnormal that they represent a threat to the United States.

This is why for days now the Democrats and the media have been acting terrified of some major attack on America or Americans by Iran. In their view such an attack would reveal the supposedly reckless nature of Trump’s choice to take out Soleimani. But as noted above, the Iranians have already killed an American and launched an attack on an American embassy. There is no reason to believe that Iran would have stopped its attacks on America and her interests had Trump done nothing.

Indeed, had Trump done nothing in the wake of the embassy attack it could well be seen as a green light for further actions, confident America would not significantly respond. After all, when Trump did show restraint in July after the drone downing, all he was rewarded with by Iran was an increase in attacks.

As with any military action there are reasonable positions to be taken on all sides, but the idea that the Trump administration doesn’t have their story straight on the reasons for the attack just doesn’t hold up. Further, the idea that the administration is lying about the existence of evidence of an imminent attack is based on nothing more than basic distrust of Trump, not any facts that support the theory.

"Whether You Like It Or Not, The United States Is At War With Iran","“The light is dimming, and night may well be approaching at long last.” That was historian David Crist’s assessment from 2012 of what the future held for the 40-year conflict between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The neutralization of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Gen. Qasem Soleimani on January 3, along with other key Iran-aligned leaders, was undoubtedly the climax of a jaw-dropping turn of events spanning a week, beginning with the death of an American contractor following a rocket attack by Kata’ib Hezbollah.

Reaction to the Soleimani killing proved divisive as ever. Like all of President Trump’s decisions, support or opposition fell along partisan lines. Contrast that with 2011, when Republicans checked their pride to credit President Barack Obama with the decision to kill Osama bin Laden. It appears the days of “rally ‘round the flag” are indeed over, even for “the world’s no. 1 bad guy.”

So, what comes next? Again, it depends on whom you ask and whether one supports the president. Supporters insist that, ultimately, Iran will de-escalate in the face of overwhelming American military might. With credibility and deterrence re-established after years of accommodation by the Obama administration, Iran will eventually see the writing on the wall and, as they did during the Iran-Iraq War, capitulate and agree to a new deal, one lopsided in America’s favor, which is what Trump’s always wanted.

The opposition, on the other hand, appears concerned regarding the outbreak of a wider conflict, perhaps even a Third World War. Some of these concerns appear genuinely legitimate, while others are blatantly partisan. At best, the opposition, 2020 Democratic presidential candidates included, seem torn between celebrating the demise of someone with American blood on his hands and conveying concerns about the path forward and inevitable Iranian retaliation. At worst, opponents view the incident as another opportunity to exhibit their hatred of Trump.

Both Sides Are Wrong

Both sides are wrong. Supporters have echoed Trump’s insistence that targeting Soleimani and the “maximum pressure” campaign isn’t meant to start a war. They’ve attempted to shore up the president’s position by saying he has no intent to invade Iran and overthrow its regime a la Iraq 2003, that this is about credibility and deterrence, and military action is a means of ensuring “peace through strength” and giving teeth to diplomacy.

But if the events of the past several days prove anything, it’s that deterrence has failed and so has “maximum pressure.” Deterrence is like a security camera—it prevents thieves from stealing until somebody decides to steal anyway. Once Iran began to sabotage oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and shoot down an American drone, they were no longer deterred.

The same thing occurred last weekend. After the United States launched retaliatory strikes against Kata’ib Hezbollah, Iran responded by sending militias to swarm the American embassy. We now await and see how Iran responds to the death of Suleimani. Only the absence of retaliation or some lower-level action that gives both sides a face-saving way out of the predicament can restore deterrence. Otherwise, fight’s on.

Demanding Capitulation Is a Setup for Failure

The fact Iran has yet to come to the negotiating table, shown no willingness to do so, and has now lashed out violently means any hope of Tehran yielding to the United States without bloodshed has vanished. It was always a pipe dream; what Secretary of State Mike Pompeo considered diplomacy were 12 demands which effectively amounted to a call for unconditional surrender.

The theocratic regime is reprehensible, but if the administration were genuine in its hopes for diplomacy, demanding capitulation upfront is a setup for failure, no matter the regime. A strategy like “maximum pressure,” which explicitly seeks to destabilize Iran, also serves as a non-starter for peaceful resolution.

Hawkish Trump supporters try to assuage concerns by pointing to Trump’s unwillingness to invade Iran and overthrow its regime. This isn’t only cold comfort, but disingenuous. First, it’s become apparent what Trump says is less important than what his administration does. Even as he insisted regime change wasn’t the objective, his administration, its individual backers, and Trump-friendly think-tanks made clear peaceful regime change was on the table.

Second, their argument hinges upon a very selective definition of war, one in which the United States has either formally declared it, in a legal sense, or where the United States launches a full-scale ground invasion to topple the ayatollah’s regime. But war is merely a state of armed conflict, “an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will,” as Prussian general Carl von Clausewitz defined it. Playing fast-and-loose with the definition of war ignores the obvious fact both sides have used force to influence the behavior of the other side. When Iran targets Americans and America strikes back and vice versa, it’s a war, like it or not.

Peace Is an Impossible Goal

Critics of Trump also cannot be allowed to engage in disingenuity. The president has been accused of stoking tensions through his pressure campaign and by abrogating the Iran nuke deal. There’s no question Trump might’ve overplayed his hand, when a containment strategy wasn’t only preferable, but quite appropriate for the threat Iran actually poses to the United States. But Trump’s critics are kidding themselves if they believe the nuke deal was the difference between peace and war with the Islamic Republic.

If the events of the new year prove anything, it’s that the United States and Iran will never see eye-to-eye on a wide range of issues. There are too many flashpoints, Iraq included, where the two countries would’ve eventually collided.

Furthermore, the deal never addressed Iran’s overall behavior and its latent anti-Americanism, a showstopper to any peace overture from the United States. Supporters of the deal dismiss such concerns by insisting the deal was never meant to solve all problems between Washington and Tehran, but ensuring Iran never obtains nuclear weapons nor impedes U.S. interests in the region requires improved relations. The idea that a narrowly focused agreement between the Obama administration and President Hassan Rouhani (not the supreme leader) could set the countries up for peaceful relations is as fallacious as demanding and receiving capitulation.

The shameful cynicism conveyed by Trump’s political opponents isn’t worth addressing, except to say it’s asking too much to think the United States should absorb aggression and provocation from Iran without retaliating at some point. American policy may be foolhardy, its strategy reckless, but, at the operational and tactical level, we’ve acted with restraint toward Iran both recently and throughout the 40-year conflict. There’s no straightforward approach to dealing with the world’s “bad boys” and, until recently, the United States has handled the situation as prudently as could be expected.

What’s Happening Next

That brings us to the vote by the Iraqi parliament to dismiss U.S. forces from Iraq, an unintended yet totally anticipated consequence of Soleimani’s killing. Iran’s objective has always been to oust U.S. forces from Iraq; abrogating the nuke deal, “maximum pressure,” and Soleimani’s death has accelerated that timeline. Overt actions to precipitate withdrawal, such as missile strikes, are unlikely, since they’d risk overwhelming retaliation against Iran proper and, at least temporarily, force the United States to fortify its presence in the region.

Attacks on high-value targets and large-scale terrorist attacks aren’t immediately likely, but will become increasingly likely in the long run.

It’s also unnecessary. Iran’s access to a deep roster of militants and terrorists ensures a virtually unlimited number of players with which to attack U.S. interests and personnel. Expect more of the same going forward—rocket attacks against U.S./Iraqi installations, stirring up civil unrest via the Popular Mobilization Forces, suicide bombings, and other low-level, asymmetric forms of warfare. Given the loss of top commanders like Soleimani, Iran may decide more U.S. personnel are all fair game.

Attacks on high-value targets and large-scale terrorist attacks aren’t immediately likely, but will become increasingly likely in the long run, especially as hostilities escalate. The purported existence of Iran-backed terror cells in North, Central, and South America loom large; Homeland Security may face its gravest challenge since the aftermath of 9/11. Finally, Iran will probably resume its creep towards nuclear warheads, as it’s now also dismissed the deal, setting up yet another collision course between our two countries.

For now, Iran will increasingly devote its efforts to ousting the United States from Iraq. It’ll rely on its many friends within Iraq and around the region. It’ll isolate and threaten those who support the American presence, gradually increase the costs of staying by killing Americans and Iraqis, perhaps unleashing a full-blown insurgency. Meanwhile, Trump’s advisers, who’ve convinced him to take on yet another endless war, will spare no expense keeping troops in Iraq, at the risk of a bigger conflict.

When the Iraqis turn completely against the Americans or the Iraqi military collapses, as South Vietnam’s did in 1975 and Lebanon’s did in 1984, there’ll be nothing left for Americans to preserve nor protect in Baghdad, and we’ll finally have reached the end of a long, tragic road. Maybe then Washington will choose to let it be.

Ben Rhodes Attacks Trump To Cloak Obama’s Role In Iran’s Forever War,"Peevish Obama national security official Ben Rhodes of “we can tell journalists anything and they’ll believe it” fame recently published an editorial in The Atlantic ripping the president’s recent dealings with Iran. Rhodes’ ripostes flow from the president’s game-changing retaliatory strike on the Obama administration partner — and leading terrorist of the leading terror force of the world’s leading terror regime — Qassem Soleimani.

Rhodes’ Atlantic retorts to Trump’s foreign policy have been as mendacious as his tweets are manic.

This all started when Trump pulled out of the Iran Deal. It never should have come to this and absolutely didn’t have to. He created this crisis. https://t.co/phtfJeBJ1J — Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) January 5, 2020

This is BS from Pompeo. This isn’t a ‘both sides argue’ issue, it’s about facts: Iran was complying with deal that rolled back nuke program and there were 0 rocket attacks on US interests in Iraq during that time. Trump pulled out and Iran resumed nuke program and rocket attacks https://t.co/wSRUzuuPgz — Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) January 5, 2020

As he did with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Rhodes is again working to manipulate the press — who, in his words, “literally know nothing” — by farcically contrasting the Obama Iran policy with the Trump one. The media seems a willing partner, what with the wake-like atmosphere it has created over a genocidal jihadist’s demise, and the irresponsible war hysteria it has ginned up.

In spite of Rhodes’ cynicism, disingenuousness, and demonstrable Trump hatred, his arguments demand countering, since he and his minions lead the Democrats’ progressive foreign policy wing.

The Iran Deal Strengthened the Mullahs

Rhodes’ first major contention is that the Iran nuclear deal rolled back its program, and Iran was complying with it. Both elements of this argument are at best highly misleading. To make the case, Rhodes commits sins of omission and commission about the deal, its context, and purpose.

Rhodes cites as one JCPOA success that “Iran destroyed the core of a reactor that could have produced plutonium for a bomb.” We now know that the core of the Arak reactor to which he was alluding may well be operable, with Iran claiming it surreptitiously purchased duplicate parts to replace the ones it had destroyed to satisfy the deal.

He cites as another success that Iran “removed two-thirds of its centrifuges, the machines that can enrich uranium for a bomb.” Beyond the fact the removed centrifuges were not destroyed, but stored, prior to the Trump administration’s exit from the JCPOA, Iran had violated several centrifuge-related provisions, including busting caps. These two purported Iran deal “successes” may have been mere pauses in parts of Iran’s nuclear program, and nevertheless seem to have been tied to violations.

There is also substantial evidence the argument that “the Iran deal was working” is a fantasy. As Republican Sens. Tom Cotton, Ted Cruz, David Perdue, and Marco Rubio highlighted in a letter to then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in July 2017, open-source reporting showed Iran had:

Exceeded limits on its heavy water stocks and claimed a right to produce limitless amounts while retaining ownership by claiming it was “seeking” an international buyer,

Illegally sought to procure nuclear and missile technology — efforts German intelligence indicated persisted into 2018.

Refused to provide inspectors access to nuclear-research and military facilities where its weapons work would have been most likely occurring.

Relatedly, in September 2017, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), tasked with carrying out many Iran deal-related inspections, admitted it could not assess Iran’s compliance with JCPOA Section T, which bars Iran from engaging in “activities which could contribute to the development of a nuclear explosive device.” In June 2018, David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security testified that Section T had “not been implemented or adequately verified due to Iranian resistance.” Dating back to the start of the deal, there were indicators of other critical IAEA omissions in its reporting on Iran’s nuclear activities.

On top of these issues, the IAEA has neglected to follow up on allegations of prohibited activities taking place at certain facilities. It was reported that, months later, its officials discovered trace amounts of uranium at one of these facilities. More staggeringly, Iran was in violation of parts of the agreement dating back to implementation day.

There was an even more fundamental problem: The JCPOA was consummated with inaccurate and incomplete information, as Israel’s seizure of a massive trove of documents on Iran’s nuclear program showed. The negotiators’ gaps in knowledge would have flowed through to the deal, rendering it more deficient than it already was. This is to say nothing of Iran’s record of cheating on such deals, or the sweetheart side deals it cut with the Obama administration, or its illegitimacy in being foisted on America as an executive agreement rather than with our consent as a treaty.

But the simple fact is that even if the United States could accurately gauge Iran’s nuclear activities, and Iran strictly adhered to the deal, the theocratic regime would still be stronger than prior to the deal. The mullocracy, which had been on the brink of economic collapse, would still have received a lifeline of well more than $100 billion in freed funds and sanctions relief, and seen its nuclear and ballistic missile programs legitimated and jihadist malevolence rewarded — while retaining the capability to quickly achieve future nuclear breakout.

The Iran deal only “worked” in strengthening the regime. And that was the whole point. The notion the JCPOA was about keeping a bomb out of the mullahs’ hands only rings true to the extent President Obama was bribing the mullocracy into developing it after he left office.

Since the administration’s broader policy was to make Iran the Middle East strong horse — providing a “stabilizing” Islamist force that enabled America to retreat — the Iran deal was the gimmick by which to accomplish it. Since it was about Persian power projection rather than nuclear arms control, the Iran deal should have been called the “Mullah Recapitalization and Regional Hegemony Non-Treaty of 2015.”

The Iran Deal Did Not Create Peace

Iran didn’t fire a single rocket at US interests in Iraq during the Iran Deal. Just look at what Iran has done since Trump pulled out of that Deal. Trump is lying relentlessly and he has made things much more dangerous. https://t.co/YucbzLHDLk — Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) January 8, 2020

Rhodes’ second major contention is essentially that we were at peace with Iran while the JCPOA was still in place, and President Trump’s actions started war. He writes:

[O]ver the past year alone, Iran or its proxies have shot down a U.S. drone, harassed and seized oil tankers, bombed Saudi oil infrastructure, killed unarmed protesters, and resumed rocket attacks against U.S. interests in Iraq. During the implementation of the Iran deal, by contrast, there wasn’t a single such rocket attack from a Shia militia. Trump initiated the escalatory cycle that led us to this extraordinarily dangerous moment.

One wonders, how do Obamaites think Iran got into the position to engage in this malevolent activity, had it been such a docile force between the July 2015 deal date and the May 2018 deal withdrawal date?

Do they acknowledge, as then-Secretary of State John Kerry did, that U.S. dollars would fund Iran-backed jihadists? Do they believe Iran’s arming of proxies from Lebanon, to Gaza, to Yemen, and working to consolidate its Shiite Crescent represented peaceful endeavors? Do they ascribe no culpability to Iran for the Syrian civil war in which hundreds of thousands were slaughtered? Do they think Iran’s proxies ceased their illicit activities in Latin America and on American soil? Do they have amnesia over images of American sailors the Iranian navy captured and forced to their knees?

Leftists know well the weakness of this argument because the Obama administration bent over backwards for, aided, abetted, enabled, and invited still more of Iran’s hostile activities in the run-up to the deal and following its execution. If Iran were engaging in less open hostility toward America before it vacated the JCPOA, it is only because Iran was capitalizing on the window of opportunity the Obama administration opened for it to prepare for or avoid future battles.

The JCPOA was one stage of Iran’s forever war against America, of which we have been a victim since 1979. It enabled the regime to recapitalize, rearm, and resume its exportation of Islamic revolution with the West’s imprimatur. The Trump administration has merely shattered the illusion of peace leftists saw in Iran’s march. Iran is striking out today with Obama administration funding because the United States halted it. Tehran’s apparent face-saving response to the strike on Soleimani demonstrated Iran is acting from a position of weakness.

Iran Deal Withdrawal Made America the Strong Horse

This brings us to Rhodes’ third major contention that Trump wrongly “said that in withdrawing from JCPOA, he would be in a stronger position to stop Iran’s provocations across the Middle East.” While not exactly the president’s argument in withdrawing from the JCPOA, that decision and related actions have left America in a far better position to counter a hostile Iran.

JCPOA withdrawal was a central component of a policy that has included:

Bleeding the regime of money through reimposing crippling sanctions, and then fortifying and augmenting them,

Retaliating to attacks on Americans and American assets expeditiously and, where merited, with overwhelming force — and threatening greater punishment should further threats materialize,

Fostering a U.S.-Israel-Sunni Arab, anti-Iran partnership to restore Sunni-Shia balance and enable the United States to reduce its footprint in the Middle East.

Consequently, the Iranian regime is facing a collapsing economy, related unrest at home and within its putative satrapies, several proxy wars, and no more Soleimani. This reality has left it impoverished, over-extended, and outgunned. America is in a far stronger position to deal with Iran’s provocations under Trump than at any time since Obama entered office.

Democrats Hate that Trump Puts America First

The Iran deal was a ruse. The mullocracy engaged in malicious acts before, during, and after it. The deal did not diminish Iran’s bellicosity; it fueled it, while emboldening the cantankerous regime. The rockets and missiles being fired at Americans, the still hundreds of thousands more aimed at Israel, and the weapons mowing down dissidents on the streets of Iran and Iraq are the Obama administration’s legacy.

The Trump administration is seeking not only to roll back the gains Obama provided the Khomeinist regime, but to weaken and destabilize that regime through maximum economic pressure backed by overwhelming military might and re-established Sunni-Shia balance, so our troops can come home on our terms. The overall aim is to increase the likelihood Iran will sue for peace, however remote that prospect might be, which appeasement could never achieve.

Democrats would have us believe the use of overwhelming force is the real danger. They would have us believe the threat of unpredictable and disproportionate strikes, and a willingness to show greater tenacity than an enemy, is unlikely to save America from more protracted battles; that history from World War II to Israel’s experience with the Islamic world shows it is not strength but weakness that ceases hostility.

Democrats want us to believe that in spite of the Trump administration’s consistent statements and actions, his Iran strategy is incoherent; that we should distrust our lying eyes about Iranian attacks on Americans, and disregard the heretofore infallible national security apparatus when it says plotters are planning additional ones. They want us to think Trump has caused Iran’s hostility, not that he is working to put an end to it.

The Trump administration is prudently and resolutely defending American national interest. Apparently, Democratic opponents cannot abide this. For to do so would lay bare the bankruptcy of their worldview, and the disaster it has created for America.

National Review Shouldn’t Join The Left In Blaming Jews For Antisemitism,"Sometimes even a publication you’ve long admired gets things horribly wrong. In this case, it’s National Review, which just published an incredibly problematic article, “Anti-Semitic Attacks Shine Spotlight on Long-Simmering Tri-State Tensions,” written by Zachary Evans, attempts to explain rising antisemitism in the New York area.

It’s a question demanding answers, especially in light of December’s antisemitic attacks in Jersey City, which left three dead at a kosher grocery, and in Monsey, which left four injured and one man facing permanent brain damage and partial paralysis. Instead of contributing to a greater understanding of the issues at hand, however, the article dives deep into the “communal tensions” narrative that both David Harsanyi (writing for National Review) and I have criticized for its fundamental victim-blaming.

Community ‘Tensions’ Didn’t Cause Antisemitic Attacks

The notion that “tensions have existed for decades in the Jewish enclaves that surround New York City” is a non-sequitur if we’re trying to understand what happened in Jersey City and Monsey. No news report has described Jersey City attackers Francine Graham and David Anderson as neighborhood residents. The idea that they experienced long-simmering “tensions” with the yeshiva children they’d initially planned to attack, or with the couple at the kosher grocery store they actually attacked, makes zero sense. This narrative also glosses over the insane idea that murder would be a rational way to handle neighborly disputes.

Grafton Thomas, who attacked the Hanukkah gathering in Monsey with an 18-inch machete, was likewise not a neighbor. The National Review article describes Thomas as a Crown Heights native, neglecting to mention he’s more recently resided “in Greenwood Lake, New York, which is about 20 miles away from Monsey.” In other words, Thomas — like Graham and Anderson — had to go out of his way to attack Jews, who were minding their own business.

As for the “outmigration from New York City” referenced in National Review’s article, Monsey is not a new center of observant Jewish life. That Jewish community has been there for decades, but even if it hadn’t been, that shouldn’t matter. Americans should be able to move without strangers second-guessing their housing decisions.

Reporters Need to Check Facts on Ad Hominem Attacks

Then, of course, there’s the anonymous allegation in the article that Hasidim are like “locusts, who go from community to community … just stripping all the resources out of it.” The anonymous interviewee, described as a “Jewish, but not ultra-Orthodox, resident of upstate New York,” sounds shockingly unfamiliar with the history of insect analogies used to dehumanize Jews. Those include Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson comparing some Jewish Israelis to termites in 2016, and U.S. Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan tweeting, “I’m not an anti-Semite. I’m anti-Termite” in 2018.

In a follow-up article, Evans notes that including this grotesque comparison “obviously does not constitute an endorsement of its language or its argument,” but for that to be “obvious,” there must be a sharp rhetorical divide between this interviewee and the rest of the article. There is not.

Consider the uncritical comment about “the perception that many of the men either don’t work or make low salaries, choosing instead to devote their time to studying religious texts.” The Orthodox Jewish Public Affairs Council (OJPAC) found that “69.9% of males age 20-64 in Kiryas Joel [another heavily Hasidic area north of New York City] were employed during the 2013-2017 Census survey years. This tracks closely with the 75.8% males across New York in the same age group that were employed.”

While this data is not specific to Monsey’s Hasidim, it illustrates why “the perception” that Hasidic men don’t work is false. And as OJPAC has also noted, this narrative of Hasidim as a financial burden is swiftly contradicted by the many articles blasting Hasidic Jews as wealthy gentrifiers in Brooklyn and Jersey City.

Stop Blaming Jews for Antisemitism

All these criticisms of New York’s Hasidim, and Jews more broadly, underscore that antisemitism is fundamentally illogical. Depending on the speaker, Jews are told to “go back to” New York or Israel or Poland — where most Jews never lived. Jews are regularly criticized as both communists and capitalists. Jews are called both white supremacists and the authors of white genocide. The only through line is projection, revealing more about the bigots hurling these insults than about Jews.

If the goal of publishing Evans’s article was to better inform or even fight antisemitism, it was not helpful. When vulnerable minority groups are physically attacked, mainstream — as in non-extremist — publications typically excoriate the attackers. However, too many articles about antisemitism, including this one from National Review, explain away recent attacks with “context” the writers would never offer in discussing any other racial, religious, or ethnic minority group.

Editors of all publications would be wise to adopt a litmus test: If you wouldn’t assign or accept an article pursuing a particular angle about any other vulnerable group, don’t do it for American Jews, who are facing a troubling uptick in antisemitism. Abolish the double standard.

Normal people don’t nod along when wife-beaters or rapists insist their victims “deserved it.” Nor should anyone of goodwill ever provide cover for antisemites, who similarly blame Jews for their own antisemitic misdeeds. Regardless of any justifications offered, the truth remains: Jews are not to blame for antisemitism; antisemites are.

"No, It's Not Even A Question: Jewish Lives Matter","Last week, National Review published an appalling article by Zachary Evans about the recent wave of antisemitic violence against ultra-Orthodox Jews in and around New York City. It claimed to provide context for these attacks but was inadvertently (I hope) an exercise in victim blaming.

In response to many readers’ outraged replies, both the Review’s editors and several staff members made matters worse by refusing to acknowledge any problem with the article. The worst was this screed by Kevin Williamson accusing critics of reading the article in bad faith simply to attack National Review, as if the only thing at stake here was a petty media squabble.

It seems clear that National Review’s leaders truly don’t understand why this article was offensive, and that this is at least in part thanks to their ignorance about ultra-Orthodox Jews in New York. Their responses reflect basic misunderstanding of the context in which Evans’ article was published, and thus of its potential effects.

An Existential Issue for Orthodox Jews

That this is genuinely an existential issue for Orthodox Jews, not a debate over high-speed rail or corporate tax rates. Orthodox schools no longer leave their doors unlocked. People walk with their necks craned in neighborhoods they have lived in for years, looking for an escape route should someone suddenly attack. My family is not Chassidic, but we are nonetheless terrified: because we are visibly Jewish we feel at risk whenever we leave the house.

The second point requires more explanation: the article played into a long-standing media bias against ultra-Orthodox Jews in general, and Chassidim in particular, that would seem shocking if displayed against any other minority group. For years, the press has written about Chassidic communities in terms that would be hard to imagine being applied to other groups.

Not only are Chassidim routinely presented as the quintessential other—foreign, incomprehensible, hostile to outsiders—but they are routinely described as wealthy slumlords, cheats, and crooks, while paradoxically also all poor, uneducated, and living off government assistance. These contradictory narratives agree on one point: Chassidim move into neighborhoods, take them over, and so create “tension” with the original residents.

None of this is unique to Evans’ article. This form of bias has been a serious problem for years—so much so, that when BuzzFeed recently ran an article about Orthodox Amazon Marketplace sellers that treated Chassidic Jews as ordinary people with ordinary ambitions and needs, its author received an outpouring of effusive from Chassidim.

Evans’s article, in contrast, did precisely what every mainstream paper has done, and recycled many tropes about Chassidim. More concerning is National Review’s institutional response. Here are some responses to their major defenses of this article.

Yes, Jews Can Stereotype Other Jews

It doesn’t matter that the article was written by a Jewish IDF veteran. What many people who don’t know much about this issue fail to understand is that not all anti-Semitism takes a single form: anti-Chassidic animus is a special flavor of its own. In fact, a great deal of the toxic narrative about Chassidim commonly forwarded by the media comes from other Jews.

Most people—even modern Orthodox Jews!—are ignorant about Chassidic life, but many Jews believe falsely their shared ethnic background gives them insight others don’t have. Moreover, as Jews, they feel free to indulge in some of the vilest stereotyping of Chassidim imaginable, using language and tropes that have justified antisemitism throughout history.

When Williamson touts the fact that Evans is Jewish, and has served in the IDF no less, he only betrays his ignorance. Evans likely knows as much about Chassidim as Williamson does—which is to say, nothing.

That Williamson thinks that an article by a veteran of the Israeli military could hardly have been antisemitic is beyond laughable. A minute’s Google search would have revealed to him that the IDF hates the Haredim (of whom the Chassidim are a sub-group) and that the Haredim hate the IDF right back.

This Isn’t About ‘Community Tensions’

The article’s central mistake begins with its headline. It isn’t true, as the headline asserts, that the anti-Semitic attacks shine a spotlight on long-simmering communal tensions. The two have nothing to do with each other.

To the extent that one can call one-sided antipathy a conflict between “local” communities and Chassidic communities, those conflicts are a product, rather than a cause of, antisemitism. In any event, they have nothing to do with a man driving 30 minutes from his home to machete a bunch of Chassidim in a neighborhood that Orthodox Jews have now lived in for 70 years.

The key rhetorical move on which Evans’ article hinges (and Jason Lee Steorts singles out in his defense of Evans) states “the attacks have rattled ultra-Orthodox in those areas nonetheless, owing in part to preexisting disputes between some ultra-Orthodox communities and the neighboring non-Jewish population in those areas.”

It’s not clear exactly what this means—it hazily implies a connection between the attacks and the “disputes” without actually pinpointing what the connection is—but to the extent that it means anything, it simply isn’t true. Haredim (indeed, all visibly Orthodox Jews) are not rattled as a result of zoning disputes. They’re rattled because they are afraid they are going to be hacked to death with a machete.

The entire article is slanted by this flawed connection. As Evans describes—in his own voice, not in quotes—how Haredim move into rural neighborhoods and develop them, live in close proximity to each other, vote as a bloc, and take public benefits, he is reproducing the very anti-Chassidic and yes, antisemitic, claims that so otherize the Haredim in the public eye.

It’s not that any of these things are false. It’s that they are completely unremarkable activities that all Americans engage in. But in highlighting them as relevant to anti-Chassidic violence he validates the notion that they represent a real source of conflict with their neighbors.

Details That Appear Negative Without Context

Finally, National Review editors seized on the fact that the article’s most-cited quote, “Many in the community look at the Hasidim as locusts, who go from community to community . . . just stripping all the resources out of it,” was not Evans’ own statement. Surely we all know that writers quote sources to document them, and not to agree with their content?

But this misses the point. Of course Evans didn’t say this himself, and reporting a quote is not the same as endorsing it. But this quote caps a series of paragraphs that suggest he likely does believes that some less extreme and more nuanced and charitable version of the sentiment is true—if not an excuse for murder.

But here’s the problem. If you knew anything about the Haredim, you wouldn’t pick those features of Haredi life to report.

What does bloc voting have to do with antisemitism? Why is it even in the article?

Someone who knew the community might have written an actual description of Haredi life: The degree to which violent crime falls to near-zero in Chassidic neighborhoods, property values shoot up when they move in, tax rolls are filled (every Chassidic kid enrolled in a Yeshiva rather than public school saves the state about $25,000), and communal services such as ambulance corps (available to all) flourish. Evans might have pointed out that Chassidim in Kiryas Yoel (an all-Chassidic town) make perfectly average incomes, despite a near common-consensus by outsiders to the contrary.

Instead, inflammatory questions are raised without any explanatory context. Why do Chassidim get to sit on the school board when their children don’t go to public school? There are many possible answers to this—beginning with the fact that they pay taxes that support public schools—but the article provides none of them, leaving the reader with the impression of Jewish control of non-Jews.

What does bloc voting have to do with antisemitism? Why is it even in the article? Why is Shulem Deen—an ex-Chassid who is a known vocal critic of Chassidim—quoted representing the Chassidic experience, and wondering whether the antisemites might have a point after all: “Do others have a right to settle in a certain vicinity, in a region, and make that place their own?”

The ‘tensions’ provoked by Chassidim are in many respects the same as the tensions historically provoked by African Americans when they moved into white neighborhoods.

Well, do they? Last time I checked we lived in the United States of America, where the answer to that question is an unequivocal “Yes, they do.” Was he quoted as an example of the animus Chassidim have to deal with? If so that was a particularly subtle point that may have benefited from expansion.

Evans seems to believe Chassidim make life challenging for their neighbors. They legitimately provoke tensions with the people they settle among. Sometimes these tensions have boiled over into antisemitism. This is one of the contributing factors to attacks on Jews and their fear of being attacked.

In fact, the “tensions” provoked by Chassidim are in many respects the same as the tensions historically provoked by African Americans when they moved into white neighborhoods. That is to say, they aren’t so much tensions as prejudice.

When someone drives like a maniac on the New York streets, people shrug and say, “Well, that’s New York for you.” When a Chassid does it, it represents a legitimate concern about his community’s lack of respect for secular law. This perception of Chassidim has its roots in a type of antisemitism that has historically been the most damaging to Jews: the constant portrayal of Jews as “other” and of their ordinary human behaviors as threatening.

The problem with Evans’s essay is not its uncritical repetition of a source who calls Chassidim “locusts,” but its attempt to connect—in any way—ordinary Chassidic behavior, disputes over zoning and finances, and political clout, to horrifying antisemitic attacks on Chassidim. The “tensions,” such as they are, do not contribute to rising antisemitism, they are rising antisemitism.

Stop Blaming the Victims and Start Blaming the Murderers

If nothing else, NR’s editors should perhaps have considered this: across the board, Orthodox Jews who live with the fear provoked by these assaults were horrified and terrified by the article. It was reported with alarm in nearly every Orthodox publication that appeared this week.

Conversely, it was gleefully endorsed by neo-Nazis and the alt-right, who circulated it. But instead of reconsidering their stance, National Review gave the Principal Skinner response: “No, it’s the rest of the world who is wrong.”

But there’s something even more alarming about this conflict, for Jews and for the conservative movement more broadly, which Williamson’s two screeds brought to life. Besides betraying his ignorance on all matters Chassidic, Williamson also betrayed an unwillingness to treat his Jewish readers with a presumption of good faith. The article’s critics didn’t fail to understand how quotes work; they recoiled at the false and distorted narrative laced throughout the entire essay.

I confess to having enjoyed Williamson’s writing in the past. It was a shock to watch him lash out at vulnerable people—among them, friends and former colleagues—accusing them of petty political bad faith when they are afraid for their physical safety.

Yes, Jewish Lives Matter

Beyond a very Inside Baseball punditry dustup, why does this matter? It matters because in the past few decades otherizing rhetoric of the kind found in Evans’s essay has become endemic in mainstream and progressive publications. Ultra-Orthodox Jews’ migration to the conservative political camp has been at least partially the result of their perception that at least in the conservative movement they would be treated as human beings.

Williamson’s response, which National Review saw fit to print (twice!), gives the lie to that notion. Instead it is clear that just like the conditional accommodation of Jews on the left, for the right, as well, Jewish lives are contingent.

It’s shouldn’t be so hard to say “Sorry, we got it wrong.” Being able to reconsider one’s actions is a mark of principle, of good faith, and of the best conservative values of truth, charity, humility, and loyalty.

Williamson owes the article’s critics (particularly Bethany Mandel) a public apology. National Review should have done its research before publishing that article, and should have responded to criticism in good journalistic fashion by allowing someone to pen a response in their pages.

Candidates’ Health Take Center Stage In Run Up To Nevada Debate,"Just hours before the two come head-to-head for the first time in Las Vegas for the ninth Democratic primary debate, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg sparred over whose heart health was in better condition.

Sanders, 78, suffered a heart attack last fall and initially mislead the public about the senator’s hospitalization. Bloomberg, also 78, had two coronary stents inserted in 2000.

Questions over the candidates’ health surfaced on Tuesday when Sanders said during a CNN town hall that he would not release more medical records four months after his heart attack.

Sanders’ national press secretary, Briahna Joy Gray, characterized questions related to Sanders’ health as part of a “smear campaign” against the senator.

“What you’re seeing right now is really reminiscent of some of the kind of smear, kind of skepticism campaigns that have been run against a lot of different candidates in the past,” Gray said. “Questioning where they’re from, aspects of their lineage, et cetera, et cetera.”

Gray then continued to accuse Bloomberg of having suffered heart attacks, though Bloomberg’s 2000 procedure does not mean the New York billionaire has ever had one. Last year, Bloomberg also released a letter last year noting that the businessman has undergone heart surgery but makes no mention of a heart attack.

“It’s really telling given that none of the same concern is being demonstrated for Michael Bloomberg, who is the same age as Bernie Sanders who has suffered heart attacks in the past,” Gray said.

The Bloomberg campaign immediately shot back, condemning Gray’s remarks as untrue.

“This is such a Trumpy lie from the Sanders camp, which rolls like Trump in many ways,” wrote Bloomberg senior advisor Tim O’Brien on Twitter.

This is such a Trumpy lie from the Sanders camp, which rolls like Trump in many ways. Mike Bloomberg has *never* had a heart attack. Bernie Sanders, on the other hand, has had a heart attack. Those are the facts. It’s a dangerous time when Sanders goes all in with Trumpism. https://t.co/Yk6RlI8WaN — Tim O'Brien (@TimOBrien) February 19, 2020

Bloomberg’s campaign manager, Kevin Sheekey, also blasted Gray for “spreading lies,” and called on more transparency over Sanders’ health.

“The truth is: After a positive stress test in his doctor’s office at John Hopkins University in 2000, Mike had two coronary stents placed,” Sheekey said in a statement. “He quickly told the FAA, consistent with the rules for any pilot, and this information has been public for years. The Bloomberg 2020 campaign released more information about his outstanding health soon after he entered the race.”

Sanders on the other hand, Sheekey said, “had a medical incident in Las Vegas. He didn’t tell the public for days and the full details have never been released.”

Gray began to walk back her comments from CNN saying she “misspoke” when she charged Bloomberg with having a heart attack.

I mispoke when I said Bloomberg had a heart attack. Rather, he underwent the same stent procedure as Bernie. Bernie released 3 detailed medical reports in December — just like the other candidates. — Briahna Joy Gray (@briebriejoy) February 19, 2020

The quarrel between the two campaigns has now brought many of the leading candidates’ age back into the spotlight raising questions over whether they can manage the stress that not only goes into a presidential general election but also to lead the nation for four years before running again.

The top four candidates leading in Real Clear Politics’ latest aggregate of national surveys are each 70-years-old or older.

Sanders in first place is 78, while former Vice President Joe Biden in second is 77, followed by Bloomberg in third who is also 78 and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren who is 70.

Biden has enjoyed no shortage of concerns over his own age and ability to confront the challenges ahead in his old age and has only sewn further doubts by proceeding through the campaign with a series of gaffes and slip-ups raising the anxieties of those worried about the former vice president’s sharpness to take on President Donald Trump this fall.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/02/19/candidates-health-take-center-stage-in-run-up-to-nevada-debate/,2020-02-19
Will The Taliban Uphold Its End Of The Afghanistan Deal?,"After almost 19 years of war, the United States has successfully negotiated a peace agreement with the Taliban, setting up an eventual total withdrawal of American and coalition military forces in 14 months, so long as the Taliban holds up their end of the bargain. The full text of the agreement makes clear the desired end state is indeed a full-stop U.S. exit from the war:

The United States is committed to withdraw from Afghanistan all military forces of the United States, its allies, and Coalition partners, including all non-diplomatic civilian personnel, private security contractors, trainers, advisors, and supporting services personnel within fourteen (14) months following announcement of this agreement…

It further states, in the first 135 days of the agreement: “They will reduce the number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan to eight thousand six hundred (8,600) and proportionally bring reduction in the number of its allies and Coalition forces.”

The 8,600 number has been floated for some time, initially implied as an enduring presence to facilitate counter-terrorism operations in the jihadist-infested country while reducing the overall scope of the mission. But, as the agreement makes clear, the United States and its allies are indeed looking for the exits. If all goes to plan, U.S. and coalition forces will completely vacate Afghanistan by spring 2021.

While it may be too early for optimism, it is not too early to say this is a major milestone. Since the beginning of his campaign, President Donald Trump has constantly pledged to end America’s “endless wars.” He spent the first three years of administration largely failing to do so, even escalating the effort in Afghanistan in August 2017.

His attempts, most notably the bid to withdraw troops from eastern Syria, have been haphazard and poorly coordinated, and lacked the energy and focus necessary to make big decisions stick. But here we are, at an agreement with the Taliban, something neither the Bush nor Obama administrations achieved in their combined 16 years of presiding over the conflict.

The Moment We’ve Been Waiting For?

The deal also comes a few months after proposed peace talks at Camp David were scuttled in September upon the death of an American soldier. Since the start of the administration, the United States had ramped up the air war on the Taliban, dropping 7,423 weapons on Afghanistan in 2019. These numbers rival the ordnance expenditures of the 2010 – ’11 “surge” era of the Obama administration. Following the cessation of talks in September, the United States continued to strike the Taliban through the new year, until a seven-day period of reduced violence to facilitate talks between the two sides.

Is this the moment we have been waiting for? Or is it too good to be true? For the agreement to hold up, the Taliban must, above all else, “not allow any of its members, other individuals or groups, including al-Qa’ida, to use the soil of Afghanistan to threaten the security of the United States and its allies.” This is, of course, the billion-dollar question behind the agreement: can the Taliban be trusted to not permit terrorists to use the country as a safe haven?

It’s a largely irrelevant question, however, since the safe haven argument is a myth. As the Cato Institute’s John Glaser and John Mueller explained last summer:

…the notion that terrorists need a lot of space and privacy to hatch plots of substantial magnitude in the West has been repeatedly undermined by tragic terrorist attacks in Madrid in 2004, London in 2005, Paris in 2015, and Brussels and Istanbul in 2016. None of the attackers in those incidents operated from a safe haven, nor were their plans coordinated by a group within a safe haven.

While most of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 received training in Afghanistan, much of their planning and preparation took place in the United States and Germany, including flight training. Ultimately, the decisive factor in the success of 9/11, like most terror attacks, came down to their ability to infiltrate and live freely in the country they sought to devastate.

Terrorists’ ‘Havens’ Are Their Hosts

Terrorists are also highly mobile and not beholden to any particular territory. For example, both Taliban-friendly groups like al-Qaeda and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)-friendly militants operate just over the border in northwest Pakistan. It’s in this sector of Pakistan, a supposed ally, where the United States has long waged a shadow war against these groups, highlighted by the mission that killed Osama bin Laden in May 2011. The U.S counterterror mission in Central Asia long ago shifted east to Pakistan; the fight in Afghanistan has become all about nation-building and defeating the Taliban.

That said, the Taliban would certainly welcome a U.S. departure, incentivizing their compliance with the terms of the agreement. Even if the Taliban were not in full compliance with the agreement, a “spiritual” compliance would more than suffice.

What U.S. policymakers most fear is another terrorist attack on U.S. soil, the sort which precipitated the initial military intervention in October 2001. If America does not suffer a terror attack whose origins can be traced back to Afghanistan, policymakers would much rather adhere to the deal, regardless of whether the Taliban fulfilled every obligation to the letter.

The Next Time the Taliban Attacks

This leaves the question of what happens when the last U.S. soldier departs Afghanistan for good. Will the Taliban return to harboring terrorists bent on attacking the American homeland? What will be the U.S. response? Will a response even be feasible without a military presence in Central Asia? What will become of America’s covert war in northwest Pakistan?

The same rules apply: if another terrorist attack does not occur within the United States or allied countries that can be traced back to Afghanistan, American policymakers will find it much easier to stick to the script and stay away. The American public has largely tuned out Afghanistan, and the dearth of media coverage is unfortunate, but it is likely any re-escalation of the war will have negative political repercussions. Likewise, the Taliban do not want to see American troops on Afghan soil ever again and are more concerned with seizing power in Kabul than they are attacking the United States.

This certainly does not prevent terrorists from taking refuge in Afghanistan, of course. The ability to deny terrorists safe haven and prevent attacks is in large part outside the Taliban’s control, since there exists territory they do not control and the movement is quite fractured. But as long as the United States maintains an “I’ll be back” posture, demonstrated with cruise missile strikes on Afghanistan in 1998 and the air/sea/special operations effort in the early part of Operation Enduring Freedom, the Taliban will do all it can to prevent an American return.

What Happens to Afghanistan Next

What will become of Afghanistan itself? The agreement does not explicitly associate withdrawal with rapprochement between the government in Kabul and the Taliban, but Secretary of Defense Mark Esper seemed to do just that in a Washington Post op-ed, writing, “If progress stalls, then our drawdown likely will be suspended, as well.” Will the door to renewed involvement remain forever open?

During the 14-month duration of the agreement, the United States needs to be able to defer any notion that Afghanistan will collapse until after the 2020 election.

Perhaps, but this may also be mere posturing. Given the Taliban does not view the Kabul government as legitimate, the likelihood of any lasting peace between the two sides is unlikely, a fact Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley conceded. Thus, tying withdrawal to the success of intra-Afghan talks is likely a way of saying, “We won’t abandon you.”

During the 14-month duration of the agreement, the United States needs to be able to defer any notion that Afghanistan will collapse until after the 2020 election and the total withdrawal is complete. Suicide bombings and terrorism, which remain likely, can upset that delicate balance.

The situation is reminiscent of 1972, another election year, when the Nixon administration negotiated with North Vietnam to end America’s involvement in Southeast Asia. Bombing of the North had resumed earlier in the year following a three-and-a-half-year cessation. In the fall, negotiations appeared to have made progress, with National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger announcing, “Peace is at hand.”

This aided Nixon in winning a landslide victory in November, but peace talks faltered in December, leading to one final bombing blitz on North Vietnam, forcing the latter back to the bargaining table. A final agreement was signed at the Paris Peace Accords in January 1973, finally ending America’s role in the war.

The lesson of Vietnam is not that history repeats itself, but that there is a long way to go before America’s involvement in Afghanistan finally ends. Afghanistan’s salvation is outside American control, so the goal is to create the “decent interval” necessary to distance ourselves from the consequences of withdrawal. Afghanistan may be doomed to fall to the Taliban without U.S. support, but the United States cannot bring deliverance upon Afghanistan either. Sooner or later, the American intervention will outlive its usefulness.

After 19 years of blood, sweat, and tears, perhaps the time has come to let it be.

Stop Blaming Kavanaugh For Schumer’s SCOTUS Threats,"When Democratic leader Sen. Chuck Schumer threatened two sitting Supreme Court justices this week, some reporters and other Democratic politicians attempted to downplay his unprecedented attack by falsely claiming he was echoing what Justice Brett Kavanaugh had said during his contentious confirmation hearing.

Only the completely ignorant or willfully duplicitous person could make such a comparison.

In his hearing, Kavanaugh said he worried about what the partisan attempts to destroy his reputation with horrific and unsubstantiated allegations would mean for the country. Schumer, by contrast, called out Justices Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch by name and said that if they didn’t achieve his preferred pro-abortion outcome in an upcoming ruling, “you will pay the price” and “you won’t know what hit you.”

I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price. You won’t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.

While Schumer initially claimed that when he said, “I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh,” he was addressing Republican senators, nobody believed it. His threats against the justices were widely condemned even by liberal judicial activists such as Laurence Tribe. But some activists in the media and elsewhere tried to downplay the remarks by saying they echoed Kavanaugh’s words when he expressed concern for the country.

Kavanaugh’s comments don’t need context to show they are nothing like what Schumer said, but the context really drives the point home. Far from making a threat, he was expressing concern about how the rhetoric against him was putting not only his family’s physical safety at risk but threatened the health of the entire country.

This confirmation process has become a national disgrace. The Constitution gives the Senate an important role in the confirmation process, but you have replaced advice and consent with search and destroy. Since my nomination in July, there’s been a frenzy on the left to come up with something, anything to block my confirmation. Shortly after I was nominated, the Democratic Senate leader said he would, quote, ‘oppose me with everything he’s got.’ A Democratic senator on this committee publicly — publicly referred to me as evil — evil. Think about that word. It’s said that those who supported me were, quote, ‘complicit in evil.’ Another Democratic senator on this committee said, quote, ‘Judge Kavanaugh is your worst nightmare.’ A former head of the Democratic National Committee said, quote, ‘Judge Kavanaugh will threaten the lives of millions of Americans for decades to come.’ I understand the passions of the moment, but I would say to those senators, your words have meaning. Millions of Americans listen carefully to you. Given comments like those, is it any surprise that people have been willing to do anything to make any physical threat against my family, to send any violent e-mail to my wife, to make any kind of allegation against me and against my friends. To blow me up and take me down. You sowed the wind. For decades to come, I fear that the whole country will reap the whirlwind.

You can and should revisit this section of his testimony on YouTube here.

It is worth remembering that Schumer led the filibuster of Gorsuch and orchestrated much of the campaign against Kavanaugh, reportedly because he worried Sen. Dianne Feinstein didn’t have what it took to get the job done. Within minutes of Kavanaugh’s nomination, Schumer publicly announced he would “oppose Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination with everything” he had.

Schumer imposed Democrat senators’ boycott of meetings with Kavanaugh. He held a conference call where Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee came up with their obstruction tactic of interrupting Republican Chair Chuck Grassley with “I am Spartacus” moments. He raised eyebrows when he said accused nominees have no presumption of innocence.

When Michael Avennati’s client Julie Swetnick claimed — with no evidence in support and plenty of evidence in opposition — that Kavanaugh was a serial gang rapist who had roamed the streets of suburban Maryland for his prey, Schumer demanded the allegations be accepted as true and that Kavanaugh’s nomination be pulled. When Kavanaugh was confirmed, mobs of protesters sieged the Supreme Court itself, scaling walls, trying to knock down doors, and throwing tomatoes and water bottles at cars carrying departing Supreme Court justices.

Plus Bad Bible Reading

The whirlwind reference comes from the Book of Hosea, in which the prophet Hosea reminds Israel of the Lord’s loving faithfulness and calls them away from unfaithfulness. Chapter 8, verse 7, reads: “For they sow the wind and they shall reap the whirlwind. The standing grain has no heads; it shall yield no flour; if it were to yield, strangers would devour it.”

The proverb repeatedly stresses the futility of turning away from God toward false idols. This verse is quoted by many as a call to repentance when we fail to follow God’s commands. Encouraging others not to incite violence just because of political passions, then, would be an appropriate use of the verse, as Kavanaugh used it. Encouraging attacks on those who might in some way hamper the abortion lobby through a proper reading of the law, however, would not be an appropriate use of the verse. For multiple reasons!

It is unlikely that many of the reporters and other people commenting on Schumer’s remarks understand the biblical exegesis. But even at the most simple reading, Kavanaugh was discouraging personal attacks and saying he believed the politicized nomination process that led to scurrilous and unsubstantiated claims was harmful for the country, not threatening anyone. Schumer was engaging in a personal attack and threat against sitting Supreme Court justices.

So Kavanaugh worried about how baseless personal attacks on nominees could lead to a whirlwind of bad blood hitting the country at large, while Schumer called for a whirlwind of horror to come down on Kavanaugh and Gorsuch personally if they didn’t conform to his political thinking. Totally the same thing!

False Talking Point Rules the Media

The talking point that Schumer wasn’t threatening Supreme Court justices so much as paying homage to Kavanaugh got distributed heavily through talking heads and journalists. Here are a few examples, beginning with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes:

If by “literally almost verbatim” you mean “the opposite of,” then yes, yes it is.

Here the Washington Post’s Supreme Court reporter Robert Barnes misquoted Kavanaugh on his way to pushing this false talking point:

In Politico, Adam Cancryn and Dan Diamond omitted some of Schumer’s quote to make it sound less threatening and simply misquoted Kavanaugh to force a comparison. While Schumer’s threats were not characterized as angry, Kavanaugh’s concern for the country is described as, you guessed it, “angry.”

Really interesting how so many people pushing the same false talking point at the same time they managed to have so many misquotes. In any case, Vox’s Ian Milhiser got the memo, and the omission of key words:

Slate’s Dahlia Lithwick also misquoted Kavanaugh, although she later corrected part of the error. Lithwick actually has the distinction of misquoting Kavanaugh routinely.

In an article explaining that she was so emotionally distraught by Kavanaugh’s confirmation that she could not even pretend to cover him accurately, honestly, or fairly — “A Year After Kavanaugh, I Can’t Go Back To the Supreme Court” — she falsely claimed he had “promised that his doubters and detractors will ‘reap the whirlwind.'” Again, his quote was “I fear that the whole country will reap the whirlwind” of the politicized confirmation process he was put through that led to threats against him and his family.

In any case, here’s her take on Schumer:

While she corrected the article later to add in and correct the words “for decades to come. I fear that the whole country,” you might note that she eliminated the 10 or so sentences between the first line she excerpts and the last line. What curious work our journalists are doing to avoid being accurate about what Kavanaugh said or meant. As per usual.

NPR’s Deirdre Walsh claims without evidence or substantiation that Schumer’s threat was “supposed to be a reference to Kavanaugh.”

Perhaps the best example of journalistic malpractice was the article written by the aforementioned Barnes, who showed his hand with his tweet falsely conflating Kavanaugh’s concern about the effect of baseless personal attacks with Schumer’s heightened campaign against the safety and independence of federal judges he opposes. Here’s how he wrote it up:

The headline on the article was a classic from the genre where journalists “pounce” and “seize” on Republicans not being silent in the face of wrongdoing:

In any case, you will note what Barnes and his coauthor Colby Itkowitz left out. They left out that there was no evidence in support of the accusation levied against Kavanaugh. That none of the four witnesses named by his accuser Christine Blasey Ford corroborated her account. In fact, they spoke against it, saying it didn’t match what they knew.

Ford’s sole claimed female witness tried hard to help her lifelong friend but came to doubt the veracity of the story, a journey told by Carrie Severino and myself in our bestselling book “Justice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court.” That story is confirmed in subsequent books by other authors.

This female witness was subjected to bullying and threats by mutual acquaintances of the two women to change her story, but she declined to do so. (See: “21 Reasons Not To Believe Christine Blasey Ford’s Claims About Justice Kavanaugh.“) Barnes and Itkowitz sanitize the campaign against Kavanaugh by failing to mention the coordinated effort to destroy his reputation with a slow drip of even more ridiculous allegations, such as the aforementioned Avenatti smear, the rape boat in Rhode Island, and other invented stories.

The two don’t note that while the Washington Post led the anti-Kavanaugh effort and legitimized the allegations without evidence against him, they dropped their investigation into what they claimed were legitimate allegations as soon as he was confirmed. They don’t mention that Blasey Ford’s attorney admitted that support for abortion motivated her and her client to push the allegations, just as Schumer’s support for abortion motivates him to threaten sitting Supreme Court justices. The attorney said the goal was not even to keep him off the court so much as to put an “asterisk” next to any ruling of the justice.

Democratic nominees’ calls to pack the court or institute term limits are about intimidation. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse recently tried to threaten the court to rule a particular way or face consequences. Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s bizarre question about the Supreme Court’s legitimacy during impeachment was itself an effort to delegitimize the court, as is the aforementioned effort to put an asterisk by certain justices’ names and rulings.

The media, however, should report accurately and honestly about Schumer’s threats and stop falsely blaming his victims. After all the media did to damage Kavanaugh and his family, honesty is the least they owe him at this late date.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/06/stop-blaming-kavanaugh-for-schumers-scotus-threats/,2020-03-06
"Weeks Before Threatening SCOTUS Justices, Schumer Condemned Trump For ‘Attacking’ Federal Judge","Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer condemned President Donald Trump for “attacking” a federal judge and called on Chief Justice John Roberts to speak up against Trump on Feb. 13. Less than a month later, Schumer threatened Supreme Court Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.

“With President Trump publicly attacking a judge: Now would be the time for Chief Justice Roberts to speak up. Now would be the time for the Chief Justice to directly and specifically defend the independence of the federal judiciary. I hope he will see fit to, and do it today,” Schumer tweeted.

Just a few weeks later, Schumer threatened two Supreme Court justices by name at a pro-abortion rally in front of the Supreme Court.

“I want to tell you Neil Gorsuch, and you Brett Kavanaugh, you have unleashed a whirlwind, and you will pay the price,” Schumer said at a pro-abortion rally. “You won’t know what hit you, if you go forward with these awful decisions.”

Roberts did stick up for the judiciary branch of the government, but not in the way Schumer had in mind. Instead of responding to the “attacks” by Trump, Roberts responded to Schumer’s threatening comments.

“Justices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous,” wrote Roberts. “All Members of the Court will continue to do their job, without fear or favor.”

On the Senate floor Thursday morning, Schumer half-heartedly apologized for using threatening language.

“I should not have used the word I used yesterday,” Schumer said. “I’m from Brooklyn, we speak in strong language, I shouldn’t have use the words I did, but in no way was I making a threat. I would never do such a thing.”

He continued by saying his threats were aimed at the political consequences Trump, Republicans, and the Supreme Court would face if the court voted against pro-abortion legislation.

“My point was that there would be political consequences, political consequences, for President Trump and Senate Republicans if the Supreme Court, with the newly confirmed justices, stripped away a women’s right to choose. Of course I didn’t intend to suggest anything other than political and public opinion consequences for the Supreme Court, and it is a gross distortion to imply otherwise,” Schumer said.

As the days turn into weeks, and weeks turn into months, it seems foreign to even think about what we did before we quarantined. Driving to work, going to restaurants, and watching March Madness all seem a world away now.

But before this life-altering pandemic, there have been other disasters. Hurricanes. Fires. Terrorist attacks. Floods. Dozens of different man-made and natural disasters of all flavors, wreaking havoc and claiming lives.

Because we’ve exclusively had the coronavirus under the microscope for the last few months, I thought it would be interesting to widen our focus to look at some of the other disasters our nation has known. In the name of widening the focus from our current situation, I specifically haven’t included pandemics or epidemics on this list. Wars have also been excluded.

Key Takeaways and Lessons from the Past

Looking over the list of catastrophes, it’s clear that death comes in lots of flavors. There are some things within our ability to control, and others that just aren’t.

The great San Francisco earthquake of 1906 struck suddenly and was unprecedented. The Pearl Harbor or September 11th attacks might’ve been known or predicted by people with special intel, but to the average Joe, again, these came as a complete surprise.

On the other hand, hurricanes hit the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic coastal areas every year. Other recurring disasters include late summer wildfires that ravage the Western U.S., or Nor’easter storms in New England and Mid-Atlantic. If you live where there are somewhat predictable weather patterns and a precedent for disasters, use this field data to prepare yourself. There are some basic recommendations about disaster preparation at the end of the list.

Galveston Hurricane of 1900

Year: 1900

Fatalities: Estimated 6,000 – 12,000

What Happened: What started off as a tropical storm that hit some islands in the Caribbean, intensified into a category-four hurricane that made landfall on Sept. 8, just south of Houston, Texas. It continued northeastward as an extratropical storm throughout the Midwest, New England, and eastern Canada before it finally re-entered the North Atlantic. It included hurricane-force winds, lightning and thunderstorms, storm surge, and flooding.

Aftermath:

Official estimates place the property damage between $28 and $35.4 million (as much as $142.7 billion in 2020 dollars).

Although it’s been more than 100 years since the Galveston Hurricane, it remains the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history.

North American Drought

Years: 1988-1989

Fatalities: Estimated 4,800 – 17,000

What Happened: Over the space of two years, severe drought throughout 45 percent of the United States brought deadly heat waves, wildfires, and dust storms. Property damage, crop damage, and livestock casualties all occurred at scale. Due to the near-nationwide crop damage, commodity prices experienced record increases.

Aftermath:

$53.25 billion of damage (as much as $116.4 billion in 2020 dollars).

The North American Drought ranks as the most catastrophic drought since the dust bowl of the 1930s.

San Francisco Earthquake (and Fire) of 1906

Year: 1906

Fatalities: 3,000-plus

What Happened: On April 18, 1906, a 7.9 earthquake struck the coast of Northern California, in San Francisco. Shortly thereafter, several fires broke out that devastated the city for days, destroying 80 percent of San Francisco, and amplifying the death toll to more than 3,000 casualties.

As traumatic as the actual earthquake was, the subsequent fires were even more destructive. Fires from ruptured gas mains destroyed 25,000 buildings in the Mission District and surrounding area. Architecture professor Stephen Sobriner maintains that the fires caused at least 90 percent of the total destruction of the incident. Widespread looting and riots among evacuees also contributed to the chaos and damage.

Aftermath:

Property loss estimates of $235 to $400 million ($6.7 to $11.5 billion in 2020 dollars).

Loss of museums, laboratories, and significant research.

Rebuilding of University of California.

To this day, the quake remains the deadliest in U.S. history.

September 11 Attacks

Year: 2001

Fatalities: 2,977 (victim fatalities)

What Happened: On September 11, 2001, four coordinated terrorist attacks resulted in the damage or destruction of the Pentagon, the north and south towers of the World Trade Center, 7 World Trade Center, and 10 other nearby buildings. The combined death toll of the four different attacks was 2,977.

Due to the destruction of the World Trade Center and other infrastructure in the financial district of New York City, Wall Street was closed until September 17, causing a blow to New York’s economy and the global markets.

Aftermath:

An estimated $10 billion of property damage ($14.6 billion in 2020)

A rash of hate crimes targeted at Muslim and Middle-Eastern individuals and communities within the United States followed.

Formation of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).

Prolonged War on Terror.

United States has been in a continuous state of national emergency ever since.

1928 Okeechobee Hurricane

Year: 1928

Fatalities: 2,500 in U.S. (4,112 in total)

What Happened: On September 6, 1928, a category-five hurricane made landfall on the east coast of Florida, and claimed the lives of 2,500 people in the United States. It also claimed hundreds of lives and seriously damaged property on the nearby islands of Guadalupe, Puerto Rico, Martinique, Montserrat, and St. Nevis. At least 2,500 people drowned, and lots of other property damage and resulting displacement followed.

Aftermath:

Estimated $100 million in total damages ($1.5 billion in 2020).

Well-constructed homes with strong shutters did not suffer nearly the level of devastation that other homes did. As a result, state and city building codes improved.

Japan’s Attack on Pearl Harbor

Year: 1941

Fatalities: 2,467

What Happened: Japanese aircraft and submarines launched a preemptive strike on the U.S. naval base in Honolulu, Hawaii. Just before 8:00 a.m. on Dec. 7, the Pearl Harbor naval base was attacked by 353 Japanese aircraft, resulting in four battleships being sunk, and four more being damaged. Six other ships were also damaged or sunk and 188 aircraft were destroyed, as well as other infrastructure. 1,178 people were also wounded.

Aftermath:

U.S. declaration of war against Japan, Germany, and Italy, formally entering World War II.

Nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Internment of roughly 127,000 Japanese Americans.

Johnstown Flood

Year: 1889

Fatalities: 2,209

What Happened: On May 31, 1889, after several days of consistent rainfall, the South Fork Dam of the Little Conemaugh River broke. Its failure resulted in the release of 14.5 million cubic feet of water, killing 2,209 people and doing roughly $17 million worth of damage.

Although some people were able to get to high ground with the little warning they had, many were trapped where they were, or otherwise unable to escape. Much of the damage of the flood was done by the debris that was swept up in the pathway of the oncoming flood—trees, houses, bridges, livestock, and more—so the effect was not only a rush of floodwater, but also one of hurling projectiles.

Aftermath:

Estimated $17 million worth of damage ($489 million in 2020 dollars).

First major disaster relief effort of the newly formed American Red Cross.

When survivors were unable to collect damages from the dam owners, legislative changes were made to shift the criteria of responsibility from a “blame” basis to a strict “liability” basis.

Cheniere Caminada Hurricane

Year: 1893

Fatalites: 2,000

What Happened: This devastating hurricane struck southeastern Louisiana with 135 m.p.h. winds in early October 1893. The island of Cheniere Caminada has a principal town that bears the same name. The town had only 1,500 residents, and lost 779 of them.

Many ships and vessels throughout coastal Louisiana and Mississippi were sunk, and the orange and rice crops of the region were utterly devastated. After the hurricane was over, it was discovered that a single damaged home was all that remained of the town of Cheniere Caminada.

Aftermath:

Estimated $5 million of damage ($135 million in 2020 dollars).

1980 Heat Wave

Year: 1980

Fatalities: 1,700

What Happened: Beginning in June of 1980, the temperatures reached 90F almost every single day in much of the central and southern United States. During this time, Memphis, Tennessee reached a record high of 108 F, Kansas City climbed over 100F for 17 days straight, and Dallas hit 113 for two days in a row. To make matters worse, the high-pressure weather system that induced many of these high temps also inhibited thunderstorm development, which caused a drought and intensified conditions.

Aftermath:

Estimated $20 billion worth of damage ($62.7 billion in 2020 dollars).

Sultana Shipwreck

Year: 1865

Fatalities: 1,700

What Happened: The Sultana was a steamboat on the Mississippi River that was designed for a maximum of 376 people. On April 27, the boat was overloaded by more than five times that limit, with a total of 2,137 people on board.

Many of the passengers were recently released prisoners of war who were being held in Alabama and needed to return to the north. Because of a greedy and opportunistic captain, the Sultana was overloaded, and three of the boat’s four boilers exploded. The boat burned and sank near Memphis, Tennessee, and 1,700 people died by drowning or hypothermia in the icy waters of the Mississippi.

Aftermath:

The death toll of this shipwreck makes it the biggest maritime disaster in the history of the United States.

In 2015, a Sultana museum was constructed in Marion, Arkansas in memoriam.

Preparations that Matter

There are some baseline preparations that just always make sense, and are handy to have in any disaster, no matter the specific situation. Included in these are:

Food storage and a water security plan

Emergency savings and reserves

Prescriptions, over-the-counter medicines, and other general medical supplies

Personal protection weapons and training

A simple survival kit or bug-out bag (in the case of displacement or evacuation)

Basic home readiness supplies: Gas and water shutoff tools Earthquake straps for furnaces, water heaters, and furniture Fire extinguishers Chainsaw Basic hand tools

Situational awareness: performing an honest audit of the threats you face

Physical fitness and healthy habits. Keep in mind that between 40 and 50 percent of Americans die from heart disease and cancer.

Adequate insurance: health, life, and property (particularly if you have a unique situation such as earthquakes, floods, etc.).

It remains to be seen just exactly how devastating the COVID-19 pandemic will end up being, or how it will compare to pandemics of the past. Almost certainly more critical to be seen is how the economic aftermath will unfold, which could last years.

Just like other disasters, all we can do is what lies within our ability to control. We don’t usually know where the next boogie man will come from, but we know he will come. While everyone is mortal, a solid foundation of personal preparedness gives everybody a better chance to be on the right side of the odds the next time around.

Communist China Uses Internet Trolls To Haze Wuhan Diary Author,"Two types of people usually emerge after living under tyranny for a long period of time. One is willing to risk their lives to speak truth, demand change, and preserve historical records and lessons for the next generation. The other group suffers Stockholm syndrome, a psychological response wherein “a hostage captive begins to identify closely with his or her captors, as well as with their agenda and demands.”

Communist China’s nationalist trolls belong to the latter group. A number of incidents that took place last week on social media demonstrate how insufferable this group is.

Wang Fang, a Wuhan-based writer who publishes under the pen name “Fang Fang,” is one of the more than 11 million Wuhan residents who lived through the two months of quarantine as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. On Jan. 25, she learned the tragic news of the passing of Dr. Li Wenliang, one of the eight whistleblowers who warned the public about the Wuhan virus back in December 2019.

Fang wrote her first entry of what later became known as “Wuhan Diary” on WeChat, a popular Twitter-like social media platform in China owned by Weibo. From then on, she wrote 60 entries until Beijing lifted the Wuhan lockdown.

Fang’s Diary Grants a Window to Wuhan

Fang’s online diary was very conversational. She talked about the weather, her flowers, the price of food, and daily challenges she faced, such as running low on her diabetic medicine. She also chronicled the sufferings and deaths she observed, as well as what she had heard from others. She didn’t shrink from criticizing the government’s cover-ups and propaganda.

For instance, when Wuhan’s Communist Party leader demanded that Wuhanese undergo “gratitude education” to thank the Communist Party for its leadership in winning the “people’s war” against the coronavirus outbreak, Fang wrote: “The government is the people’s government. It exists to serve the people. Please take back your arrogance and humbly show gratitude to your masters — the millions of Wuhan people. The government should apologize to people as soon as possible. It’s time to reflect and find people who are responsible for today’s situation.”

Her simple and straightforward writing style attracted millions of Chinese readers. Every day, people waited eagerly to devour her new entry. Of course, for the Chinese government, such truth-speaking is dangerous because it counters the government’s narrative that “the Communist Party has everything under control” and “the party knows what’s best for the Chinese people.”

Chinese censors deleted each of Fang’s posts within hours. Still, many Chinese netizens and human rights organizations managed to save digital copies of some of her entries. Some even left notes to censors, such as this one:

I am deeply touched by Ms. Fang’s essay and the difficult lives that people in Wuhan have endured. Not only are they quarantined from the rest of the world, they are also not allowed to speak the truth. When you are doing your censoring, please show mercy and see if you can let this piece stay in the public forum as long as you can before you have to delete it. Ordinary folks in Wuhan and in the rest of China are counting on someone like Ms. Fang to speak on behalf of them.

Fang expressed her censorship frustration in one of her entries:

The article I posted on WeChat yesterday was deleted again, and my Weibo account has also once again been blocked. I thought I couldn’t post on Weibo anymore, and then found out that they only censored yesterday’s post and that new posts can still be published. It made me instantly happy. Alas, I am like a frightened bird. I no longer know what I can say and what I can’t. When it comes to something as important as this fight against the epidemic, I’m cooperating fully with the government and obeying all their commands. I’m now just short of taking an oath with a fist over my heart — is this still not enough?

On March 25, in her last diary entry, Fang wrote, “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.” What she didn’t expect was that the fight to defend her reputation had just begun.

Chinese Media Will Twist Any Story

Fang’s outspokenness has attracted admirers as well as detractors. Chinese nationalist trolls started viciously attacking Fang, initially on Chinese social media platforms, publishing her home address, spreading rumors about her finances, implying she was paid by the West to fabricate her diary all this time. Some have even threatened to go to Wuhan to kill her.

After publisher Harper Collins announced it would publish a translated version of Fang’s “Wuhan Diary” this summer, these Chinese nationalist trolls began to vehemently attack her on Twitter, some insulting her appearance through fat-shaming, some claiming she’s never been a good writer, but most calling her a “liar” and a “traitor” and her diary “a tool deployed by the west to sabotage Chinese government’s heroic effort to contain the outbreak.”

The attack was led by one of communist China’s propaganda mouthpieces, the Global Times, which indicates the attack on her was not a grassroots effort. You can see a few examples here, here, and here.

Fang isn’t the only one subjected to vicious attacks on Twitter by these Chinese trolls last week. Jiayang Fan is an American journalist of Chinese descent who writes for New Yorker Magazine. She tweeted last week that for unknown reasons, security guards of Henry J. Carter Specialty Hospital forcefully removed a Chinese-speaking health worker from her mom, who has ALS. Fan said if the hospital wouldn’t restore the aid worker her mother’s survival depended on, she would have to try to get her mom out of the hospital and may have to acquire a ventilator to care for her on her own.

Chinese media quickly picked up the tweet and twisted her story. They told Chinese readers that American police forcefully removed the ventilator from a Chinese American senior infected by the coronavirus, and her daughter had to watch her die alone. Chinese media used this twisted narrative to drive home the message to domestic audiences that America treats Chinese immigrants inhumanly.

You may love America, but America doesn’t love you back, was the message. So only the Chinese Communist Party can guarantee a happy and secure life for all Chinese.

As this twisted story spread in China, Chinese nationalist trolls took delight in Fan’s mom’s suffering and attacked her on Twitter for Fan’s support for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement last year and critical reports of communist China in the past. These Chinese trolls used similar language they used to attack Fang, calling Fan a sellout and a “traitor” even though she is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Fan said she also received death threats and reprimands from these Chinese trolls.

A Profile of Chinese Nationalist Trolls

Who are these Chinese nationalist trolls? Some are nicknamed “Wumao” or “50 cents,” because the Chinese government supposedly pays them 50 cents for each tweet. Some became trolls on their own initiative, but no matter their origin, they are easy to identify on Twitter.

Keep in mind that Twitter is blocked in China, so to get over China’s internet firewall, trolls have to use a virtual private network, or VPN. Their account activation dates are often recent because they open accounts only when they identify someone to attack. They usually have very few followers and rarely follow many others because their goal is not to encounter new ideas and different opinions, but to defend Beijing’s propaganda and attack anyone who criticizes China or doesn’t tow Beijing’s official line on issues related to Hong Kong and Taiwan.

These nationalist trolls are angry most of the time, and the way they throw their insults reminds people of red guards from Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution. They are especially malicious toward ethnic Chinese who think differently. They often use the most racist, sexist, violent, and hateful language to go after ethnic Chinese women, as evident by Fang and Fan’s experiences. It is a shame Twitter has done little to rein in these trolls.

The good news is that they do not represent the majority of Chinese people. If you go through tweets about Fang and Fan, you will also find supportive and kind messages from other Chinese. Still, anyone who openly criticizes Beijing’s policies should be aware that these Chinese nationalist trolls are especially active now as Beijing is eager to deploy its digital army to deflect any coronavirus-related blame and point fingers elsewhere.

How to deal with them? Most people who were attacked by Chinese nationalist trolls chose either to block them, report them, or simply ignore them. Last week, creative Twitter users in Thailand also showed you can use satire to drive these trolls crazy.

These Chinese nationalist trolls are insufferable. They are only too happy to be locked inside a firewall. Ironically, after they have gone through all the trouble to climb over the wall, all they want to do is defend the wall’s existence and the regime that put it up. They may think they are defending and protecting China’s image, but they are actually causing more damage to China’s reputation.

WHO Director Again Parrots Chinese Propaganda In Anti-Taiwan Tirade,"While many have noted World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus’ effort to deflect criticism of his organization’s response to the Chinese coronavirus by playing the race card, far more revealing was whom he played it against. Under fire for his bias toward communist China, the Beijing-backed director-general, known simply as Tedros, sought to defend himself by slandering Taiwan, the thorn in the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) side.

During an April 8 WHO press conference, Tedros unleashed a seemingly unprovoked tirade at Taiwan. He claimed its people were leveling racist attacks at him, apparently with tacit governmental support. Taiwan’s foreign ministry unequivocally denies this charge. Tedros stated:

[S]ince I don’t have any inferiority complex when I am personally affected or attacked by racial slurs, I don’t care because I am a very proud black person or Negro. I don’t care being called even Negro. I am. That’s what came from some quarters and if you want me to be specific, three months ago this attack came from Taiwan. We need to be honest. I will be straight today, from Taiwan and Taiwan the foreign Ministry they know the campaign they didn’t dissociate themselves. They even started criticizing me in the middle of all that insult and slur but I didn’t care.

In response to Tedros’ remarks, I asked the WHO:

Can you provide any specific examples of the “attacks” to which the director-general was referring? Can you point to evidence suggesting the attacks came from Taiwan, and clarify whether the director-general was saying that private citizens from Taiwan were engaging in such attacks, or rather that its government was doing so? Can you point to evidence regarding the assertion that Taiwan’s foreign ministry was aware of this “campaign,” and “didn’t dissociate” itself?

As of this writing, the WHO has not responded to these inquiries.

The remarks came amid a public appearance in which Tedros was responding to criticism from President Donald Trump about WHO’s “China-centric” nature and threats by the Trump administration to cut the United States’ disproportionate WHO funding.

Beijing certainly would have approved of Tedros’ decision to lash out at Taiwan. After all, while democratic Taiwan has handled the coronavirus crisis with as much success as any other place in the world, further strengthening its symbol of what a free and democratic China could look like, the CCP has successfully pressured the WHO not to recognize it.

This includes the WHO’s decisions to exclude Taiwan from its World Health Assembly for the last three years, and to bar Taiwan from an emergency WHO conference on the coronavirus in January — attendance which, in retrospect, might have benefited the world tremendously given Taiwan’s handling of the crisis.

Additionally, Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs claims it warned the WHO about potential human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus on Dec. 31, something China disputed until several weeks later. The WHO instead promoted China’s view, which proved deadly.

This was the context for the infamous video in which Dr. Bruce Aylward, the leader of the WHO’s joint international mission to China regarding coronavirus in February 2020, refused to address questions about Taiwan and its response to the crisis. Aylward has repeatedly praised China lavishly for its response to the Wuhan virus. It seems the WHO will recognize Taiwan only in the course of slandering it.

Ironically, during the press conference in which Tedros bashed Taiwan, he also urged “global solidarity” and called for the world to “quarantine politicizing COVID.” He then called for “honest leadership from the United States and China,” implying an equivalence in the two countries’ responses to the virus the CCP is uniquely responsible for unleashing on the world. His pro-China orientation is evident.

It should come as no surprise that in the days following Tedros’ remarks, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs defended him. State-backed media recirculated the pro-Tedros narrative. Meanwhile, Radio Free Asia reports that investigators from Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice said they had “uncovered an effort by Chinese netizens to exploit the controversy by falsely identifying themselves as Taiwanese and issuing apologies to Tedros online.”

His effort to deflect criticism by invoking race parallels China’s attempt to de-link itself from the coronavirus by claiming that calling the Wuhan virus by its name is racist, which sadly far too many in the West have bought into, to devastating effect.

Meanwhile, the CCP disingenuously defends Tedros against unsubstantiated allegations of racist attacks while engaging in rampant discrimination against millions on the basis of their ethnicity, religion, and political views. Now, it is coming under fire from African leaders for alleged racism in “singling out of Africans for compulsory [coronavirus] testing and quarantine” at home.

Every aspect of the Tedros-Taiwan contretemps justifies criticizing the director-general, the WHO he leads, and the CCP.

4 Times LGBT Media Turned Coronavirus Into Attacks On Christians,"For many on the LGBT left, stemming from the left more broadly, mocking and attacking Christians seems to be the only thing giving them a sense of purpose during the COVID-19 crisis. While it is normal to see headlines from major LGBT sites blasting Christian leaders and denouncing the “anti-LGBT” religious right, April has been particularly inundated with such articles, especially on the most-followed LGBT news site, LGBTQ Nation.

With its 1.5 million followers on Facebook and 163,000 followers on Twitter, LGBTQ Nation holds a great deal of influence among its readers. Here are four of its headlines in the first half of April attacking Christians.

1. ‘Defiant Pastor Who Kept Church Open Despite Coronavirus Warnings Dies a Week Later from COVID-19’

Capitalizing on the recent death of Bishop Gerald O. Glenn of New Deliverance Evangelistic Church near Richmond, Virginia, the article argues, “Misguided preachers nationwide have continued to hold in-person services despite the deadly risk to their congregations, but a Virginia pastor who vowed to keep his church open and to keep preaching ‘unless I’m in jail or the hospital’ has died a week after preaching his defiant service.”

The bishop is quoted as saying, “I firmly believe that God is larger than this dreaded virus,” which was also featured in a tweet and article by The Washington Post, “Prominent Virginia pastor who said ‘God is larger than this dreaded virus’ dies of covid-19,” demonstrating that the mainstream media, not just LGBT media, are perpetuating the anti-religious narrative through their framing.

The New York Times also posted the headline, “Pastor Who Defied Social Distancing Dies After Contracting Covid-19, Church Says.” LGBTQ Nation ends its article, “But a week later, the minister has died from COVID-19. His wife is also sick.”

What they left out, detailed by local news CBS 6 News Richmond, is that the March 22 sermon, regularly aired on the news channel, occurred a day before the state of Virginia officially banned gatherings of 10 or more people. The church has held drive-in sermons since.

The bishop, his daughter says, had a serious underlying health condition. She also described him as someone who loved to greet and hug his congregants whenever he saw them in public. His wife has also tested positive for COVID-19.

2. ‘The Religious Right Has a New Coronavirus Concern: People Are Touching Their No-No Parts’

Mocking several Christian leaders for sharing their concerns about an uptick in pornography, the article quotes the Liberty Counsel, after denouncing it as a “hate group,” saying, “There are many forgotten people who have become collateral damage in these far-reaching lockdowns. We must not forget them, and we must do better to protect the people who are being harmed by the government’s response to COVID-19. Churches are more essential now than before the pandemic.”

Referring to the Family Research Council as a “hate group” as well, the article quotes Tony Perkins as saying, “We cannot afford to let this crisis open the door to a craving that destroys our kids’ innocence and future happiness.”

Despite the article presenting the concerns of Christian leaders as laughable and petty, a recent 2019 study validates them. A cross-sectional study of Polish university students in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health concluded, “In the opinion of the majority of the surveyed students, pornography use may have a negative effect on the quality of social relationships (58.7%), mental health (63.9%) and sexual performance (67.7%), as well as negatively affect psychosocial development in childhood and adolescence (78.1%).”

3. ‘Charity Compares Homosexuality to Drug Addiction to Justify Rejecting LGBTQ Coronavirus Volunteers’

As detailed here, LGBT activists have been aggressively attacking Franklin Graham’s Samaritan’s Purse charity for setting up a desperately needed 68-bed COVID-19 field hospital in Central Park. Quoting an article by the Charlotte Observer, they argue, “He said that opposition to LGBTQ rights is ‘part of who we are,’ but also justified the policy in practical terms. ‘I don’t want a person who is going to be on the job and drinks; that’s not a good witness,’ he said, effectively comparing homosexuality to drug addiction. ‘I don’t want a person who’s going to be using drugs to be part of our team.’”

The primary issue of contention is the Statement of Faith all volunteers must sign to participate in the Christian charity’s activities. Much of the media reporting has cast this as discrimination and “anti-LGBT.”

The referenced Charlotte Observer article, despite its objectionable framing, provides more useful context. Defending the Christian nature of his organization, Graham told the Observer, “Of course, I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. That’s part of who we are. So we have a long list of things we want people to understand and agree with before we take them to work with us.”

In a related article, LGBTQ Nation argued the organization could be discriminating against LGBT patients because an LGBT activist reported calling the organization to offer his volunteer services but pushed the issue of his sexuality and claimed he was “turned away” from the organization. Graham, however, had previously told the Religious News Service, “We don’t discriminate against anybody we help. We provide our services to everyone regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation. We don’t discriminate. Period.”

4. ‘PHOTOS: Hunky Jesus Contest Manages to Resurrect Our Spirits in Challenging Times’

Queerty, the sister site to LGBTQ Nation, highlighted an annual event by the San Francisco Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, the Hunky Jesus and Foxy Mary contests. The contests feature gay men dressed provocatively as both Jesus and Mary (in drag) and have become a “time-honored” celebration in the LGBT community. Mocking the central figures of billions of people worldwide is the group’s Easter tradition.

These are only a few of the dozens of articles mocking Christians: scoffing at their deaths as they advocate faith during the crisis, mocking Vice President Mike Pence, attacking Hobby Lobby and Chick-fil-A, accusing Christians of endangering the public through church services, and attempting to humiliate them during their holiest season. It borders on an obsession and appears to be little more than vindictive and petty exploitation.

People of faith have struggled to adapt to this global crisis as congregating and public worship are vital daily aspects of many religions worldwide. The attempts to suppress any gatherings whatsoever, even when participants are safely in their own cars, has caused many to challenge state orders.

But more than that, people of faith are doing their best to support each other and keep their communities active and alive. Why the left is specifically targeting Christians for shaming and defamation can only be understood as bigotry and prejudice.

As one of the loudest voices in LGBT media, LGBTQ Nation often becomes a catalyst for attitudes within the larger community. Comments on Facebook and Twitter, despite incorrect information within the articles, demonstrate the ease with which the left can be enraged and their bigotry can be validated through headlines. But feeding into this mob mentality by targeting Christians serves no other purpose than to create division and perpetuate hatred.

In a time when our culture has the opportunity to find common ground in our collective experience, we should all reject this kind of relentless stereotyping. Most importantly, the death of anyone as the result of this virus should never be exploited for political gain or social narratives.

Dear GOP: Stop Cowering Before Bad-Faith Race Card Attacks,"“Dear Mitch McConnell,” wrote Miami Herald columnist Leonard Pitts, Jr., last week. “Why don’t you just go ahead and call Barack Obama the n-word? You know you want to.”

What led to this over-the-top racial attack from Pitts? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had the audacity to disagree with an approach taken by former President Barack Obama, who leaked audio of himself critiquing the Trump administration after new revelations about his involvement spying on the incoming Trump administration. McConnell thought it an unwise deviation from norms.

The political media used to agree about the importance of this norm. In 2007, former President Jimmy Carter “incited a tsk-tsking tsunami in the capital,” wrote The New York Times’ Mark Leibovich, for the offense of “failing to observe the protocol that former presidents should speak respectfully of their successors, or at least with some measure of restraint.”

In 2013, CNN ran an article on President George W. Bush headlined, “Bush, like most predecessors, holds tongue on successor.” It’s a norm that most presidents have violated privately and several publicly, but a norm nonetheless. While it might seem a relic of a previous time, McConnell certainly wasn’t out of the ordinary in supporting this norm. And nothing McConnell said suggested he was racist in any way.

Everything Is Racist

Obama also gave a rather political commencement speech last week in which he further criticized current political leaders. That drew the attention of former George W. Bush advisor Karl Rove, who said, “It is so unseemly for a former president to take the virtual commencement ceremony for a series of historically black colleges and universities and turn it into a political drive-by shooting.”

The term “drive-by shooting” is common parlance in politics. To take one recent and high-profile example, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway both used the phrase to describe what the media and other partisans were doing to Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation by deploying last-minute, unsubstantiated accusations against him.

The Washington Post’s Eugene Scott even wrote a column headlined, “Has ‘drive-by shooting’ replaced ‘high-tech lynching’?” to discuss the phenomenon. He noted the phrase was “obviously absent of the racial implications” that he noted regarding Clarence Thomas’s description of his ordeal as a “high-tech lynching.”

But now, we are told by partisans, such language is verboten. Far-left websites pounced and blue checkmarks followed, denouncing Rove as racist for using the common metaphor. Staff writer Jon Lee Anderson at The New Yorker said Rove “just happens to wear a suit instead of a white sheet.” Subtle!

Tried and True Political Messaging

This schtick of calling Republicans racist when they do, well, anything is not new. And it ramps up in election years.

The Washington Post’s Jonathan Capehart said opposition to a coordinated campaign of political spying and leaking is the same exact thing as “birtherism,” a dodge that deserves to go in the annals of partisan excuse-making. Democratic nominee Joe Biden began his campaign last year, in the midst of a thriving economy, by making false but oft-repeated accusations against Trump regarding Charlottesville.

In 2012, then-Vice President Joe Biden told a black crowd in Virginia that the Republican Party was planning to “put you all back in chains.” In 2000, a Democratic group ran an ad saying that then-Gov. George W. Bush’s stance on hate crimes legislation was equivalent to killing James Byrd, the black man dragged to his death by three white supremacists in a truck in Texas. Policy proposals to ensure the integrity of ballots are routinely presented by Democrats as not just racist but as having no function other than racism.

Although Democrats have a near-monopoly on the black vote, the welfare, busing, and affirmative action programs they passed have failed to produce the promised results. And let’s not forget Democrats remain completely hostage to the demands of teachers unions, which resist basic educational reforms and have made trapping kids in underperforming schools the “civil rights issue of our time.” Because unions demanded it, one of Obama’s first acts as president was to kill off D.C.’s school vouchers program — which disproportionately helped poor black kids.

Democrats have done a lot of grandstanding but very little to revise, improve, or get rid of these expensive programs. Republicans have done next to nothing as well, and without even the political grandstanding.

Unfortunately, Republicans are too often tone-deaf to the concerns of black Americans. Republicans also support what they call “free trade,” which in practice is frequently a complex framework of rules and regulations to pick winners and losers among international corporations. This has hollowed out domestic industries and destroyed key jobs for African Americans.

Democrats remember that they need black voters every few years, so they whip up support with over-the-top rhetoric tarring Republicans as racist. Oddly, though, the Republican response has been to either limply respond or to join in by calling the more populist among them the same names. When Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney was the victim of Joe Biden’s drive-by shooting, his response was to meekly assert that such rhetoric was “unacceptable.” That’ll learn ’em, Mitt!

And some Republicans have shamefully joined in the practice of calling people they disagree with on policy racist. Some spent years branding their co-partisans as racist when they support populist policies such as real borders and immigration controls. They even put forth a “Republican Autopsy” that accepted the left’s arguments that such views were racist and needed to be renounced.

In this regard, President Trump may have been the first and only Republican able to withstand this, as much as he’s been able.

Go On Offense

Republicans might consider stepping out of their long-term defensive crouch. If they’re not racist, they shouldn’t be so afraid of being called it by partisans. They should denounce vicious rhetoric and not be afraid to advocate for their political philosophy and the policies that philosophy produces.

They should speak against the messages of The New York Times’ 1619 Project and in defense of the United States, her founding, and her Constitution. They should loudly note that they feel no need to apologize for the country, and to praise it for being the place — despite its many faults — with the most opportunity in the world for all its people. They should be unafraid to note the problems with viewing everything through a divisive, racialist lens and to dismiss racists of all stripes.

Republican establishment figures have fallen for the claim that suburban mothers can be turned Democrat by attacks on Republicans as racist. They haven’t figured out that not only does cowering in the face of media and partisan bullies make you appear weak and unworthy of political alignment, but a lot of voters resent it. A lot of voters wonder why Republicans aren’t doing a better job of defending the country and its founding principles against leftist rhetoric and attacks.

Democrats need huge percentages of minority voters to continue winning. Republicans should fight hard for black and Hispanic voters by adopting broadly popular proposals on foreign policy, jobs, economics, and social policy. Moving away from unnecessary interventionist wars helps, and the Republican Party finally figured that out after a few decades of being captured by interventionists.

Economic deregulation and trade policy focused on strengthening America’s backbone of industrial jobs and production also helps. A focus on all the ways government overreach has harmed family formation and family strength also helps. Black voters are more amenable to being courted than Republicans realize, and are well aware that Democrats have done very little to improve their prospects even as they take their votes for granted.

However, Republicans will have to do more than talk to earn black votes. They have to deliver. In this respect, Trump and other congressional Republicans have made positive steps by embracing and enacting criminal justice reforms. They also need to make an effort to go into black communities and truly listen to and respond to black voters, as well as recruit more black candidates and send a clear message the Party of Lincoln welcomes them as partners and not just as vote suppliers.

Have Some Self-Respect

In the meantime, Republicans leaders should wake up. Racist attacks are a distraction specifically intended to shut down debate. Even more pathetic are Republicans who accuse Trump and his supporters of being racist because they think it will generate them good press. Quislings are never respected, and the media are all too happy to use spineless Republicans as a cudgel against the entire party and conservative movement.

Instead, Republicans need to drive home the message that accusing others of racism without merit is immoral and dangerously bad for our civic health. Grown adults need to learn how to have policy disagreements without accusing others of racism. McConnell should stop acting like he’s the good Republican and Trump is the bad Republican. To powerful voices in the media and social media mobs on the left, all Republicans are the same. There is no way to virtue signal enough for them, so stop doing it.

So to McConnell and other Republican leaders, the next time a pundit or columnist goes out of his way to attack you with vicious racial rhetoric, have some confidence and stand up for what you believe. Tell them to shut up and make an actual argument in defense of this country and her ideals. You know you want to.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/20/dear-gop-stop-cowering-before-bad-faith-race-card-attacks/,2020-05-20
"Gov. Kristi Noem: ‘While The Media Was Attacking Me, The People Were Watching’","Republican South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who has faced harsh criticism from the mainstream media for refusing to shut her state down in response to Covid-19, outlined some lessons South Dakota has learned from her unique approach to the crisis.

“My approach to this virus was to provide South Dakotans with all the information that I could, and then trust them to exercise their freedom to make the best decision for themselves and for their families,” Noem said Monday. “The mainstream media has spent many hours and nearly endless column inches attacking me for that, but countless South Dakotans have thanked me for trusting them.”

When Noem refused to shut down South Dakota’s businesses and churches or to issue a statewide stay-at-home order, the media slammed her, predicting massive casualties in the state.

“Rescinding orders that people stay at home — or declining to issue them, as in the case of South Dakota and four other states — offers plenty of peril,” the Washington Post warned.

But contrary to the media narrative predicting a massive outbreak, South Dakota has seen less Covid-19 deaths than 44 other states. The total number of Covid-19 related deaths in South Dakaota is 51, ranking them above only North Dakota, Hawaii, Montana, Wyoming, and Alaska in number of deaths.

“The mainstream media attack those who push for freedom and for people to be able to make the best decisions for their families,” Noem said. “While the media was attacking me, the people were watching. As many of my peers applied a one-size-fits-all lockdown, ordinary Americans saw what we were doing and many said, ‘that’s exactly the way I want my government to treat me. To trust me, not dictate to me.’”

She also said that South Dakota’s response to the pandemic has drawn people to the state, not driven them away. On a recent family trip to South Dakota’s famous Black Hills, Noem noted that there were “license plates from every corner of the country.”

“I’ve never seen so many visitors,” she said, inviting businesses that are facing closures and regulatory burdens in other states to come to South Dakota.

“More freedom, not more government, is the answer,” Noem said, reflecting on the past few months. “Freedom is a better friend of true science than government-centered and government-controlled science. Freedom focuses our politics on persuasion and the intellectual strengths of our positions, not on control, coercion, or the heavy hand of government.”

"Australia To Beijing’s Bullying: ‘We Don’t Trade Our Values, Mate!’","Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison gave his strongest response to Communist China this week after enduring months of bullying from Beijing. He let Beijing know loud and clear that Australia is “an open trading nation, but I’m never going to trade our values in response to coercion.”

It all began back in April, when Australia led a draft resolution, which demanded the World Health Organization (WHO) conduct an “impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation of the international response to the pandemic, the actions of the WHO and its ‘timeline’ of the pandemic.” The Australian government said such inquiry is necessary to better prepare countries all around the globe for the next pandemic.

Beijing did not take Australian’s proposal very well. Beijing has categorized all investigations and inquiries regarding the origin and spread of Covid-19 as attempts to explicitly attack and blame the Chinese government for its mishandling of containment measures prior to the Wuhan virus’s wide spread.

Therefore, Australia’s proposal drew an indignant response from Beijing. China’s embassy in Canberra accused Australia of tagging along on the U.S bandwagon in the “blame war,” and warned that Chinese consumers might boycott Australian beef and wine. Hu Xijin, editor of The Global Times, a Chinese tabloid, compared Australia to “a piece of chewed up gum stuck under China’s shoe.” He further warned that Australia might pay a heavy economic price if it continues to act as the U.S.’s “attack dog.”

Australia’s export-oriented economy heavily depends on China, its largest trading partner. Between 2018-2019, Australia exported close to US$100 billion to China, which included approximately a third of Australia’s farm products.

Beijing, on the other hand, is notorious for abusing its economic leverage to coerce other countries. In 2017, after South Korea decided to allocate a construction site for hosting American-made anti-missile systems, Beijing retaliated by preventing Chinese tourists from visiting South Korea, ordering Chinese companies to boycott South Korean companies, and diverting Chinese consumers from South Korean retail stores in China.

Last month, Beijing responded to Australia’s call for a WHO inquiry into the Covid-19 outbreak by imposing an 80 percent tariff on Australia’s barley exports, while suspending beef imports from four major meat processing plants in Australia, citing them with “violations of inspection and quarantine requirements” without any specifications. Last year, China imported US$1.6 billion worth of beef and $960 million worth of barley from Australia. Beijing’s economic sanction will indisputably lay hardship on Australian farmers and Australia’s economy, both of which are still struggling to recover from the Covid-19 economic shutdown.

However, Beijing’s economic coercion backfired. Not only did the Australian government stand firmly behind its proposal, but it also received the support of a coalition of 120 countries, including Britain, Canada, Russia, and all 27 European Union member states. Australia’s proposal was adopted by WHO’s decision-making body, the World Health Assembly, at its annual meeting in May.

This month, China intensified its pressure campaign against Australia by forcing Chinese students and tourists to stay away from Australia, due to a supposed increase of discrimination against people of Asian descent. The Global Times claimed that “hanging out with friends and shopping could be dangerous” for Chinese people in Australia.

There are about 260,000 Chinese students currently studying in Australia, and about 1.4 million Chinese tourists visited Australia in 2019. Education is one of Australia’s biggest industries, generating about US$20 billion per year in revenue. China’s latest warning to its students and tourists is yet another form of economic sanctions on Australia.

Notably, Beijing’s disingenuity in these sanctioning measures also lies in its hypocrisy in labeling Australia as a “racist nation,” given that Beijing has put more than 1 million Uyghur Muslims in internment camps.

Furthermore, xenophobic incidents against foreigners in China, especially against black individuals, during the Covid-19 crisis were widely reported throughout the country, from incidents of housing refusal to deliberate segregation. A group of African ambassadors in Beijing had to file a complaint to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, demanding the immediate “cessation of forceful testing, quarantine, and other inhuman treatments meted out to Africans.”

There may be individual cases of racial discrimination against Chinese people in Australia. However, overall, Australia has been very welcoming to Chinese students, visitors, and immigrants.

Australia is one of the most open and free societies in the world. The country’s net immigration (arrivals minus departures) represents 65 percent of the nation’s population growth. All immigrants, including 1.2 million Chinese immigrants, enjoy tremendous political freedom in Australia, such as freedom of expression, a free press, and the freedom to assemble—privileges that are unthinkable back at home.

A day after Morrison dismissed Beijing’s accusation of racism in Austria and told Beijing that Australia wouldn’t trade away its values, China convicted an Australia man, Karm Gilespie, of drug smuggling and sentenced him to death. Look like Beijing won’t stop escalating the tension between the two countries.

So why does Beijing tirelessly attack Australia from multiple fronts? The most obvious reason is that Beijing views Australia’s call for a probe on the implications of Covid-19 as a smear campaign. Beijing wants to use economic coercion to force Australia to change its behavior.

By bullying Australia, Beijing signals to other countries that there will be a serious price to pay when Beijing’s authority is challenged. Moreover, Beijing ultimately views Australia as a proxy for the United States. While it may be too costly for Beijing to attack the United States directly, Beijing is confident that it can get its message out at relatively minimal cost through attacking U.S. allies.

Last but not least, Beijing’s “wolf diplomacy” cannot be discounted. Rather than building global influence through cooperative exchange and strategic diplomacy, Beijing’s new foreign policy approach is combative and antagonistic. Chinese diplomats, government officials, and state media are willing to push and defend Beijing’s policies and narratives at all costs, even at the expense of damaging international relationships.

It took courage for Australia to stare down at Beijing’s coercion. How Beijing treats Australia has universal implications. Beijing has long insisted that China’s rise is “peaceful.” However, the way Beijing has been bullying Australia demonstrates the true meaning of China’s “peaceful” rise: you can only have peace if you bend to Beijing’s will. In the new world order Beijing seeks to establish, it is the sole master, while everyone else is simply a subordinate.

As a small country, how long Australia can withstand Beijing’s bullying is uncertain. Australia is one of the United States’ main allies, and reflects many converging values. The United States should stand strong with Australia in light of Beijing’s bullying. If we don’t help our ally now, someday we may find ourselves facing Beijing’s bullying alone.

Homeland Security Chief: To Attack Our Monuments Is To Attack America,"This weekend, we celebrate the birth of the greatest enterprise in the history of mankind, the United States of America, and our ancestors’ brave decision to fight for their freedom from British oppression. That fight was led by George Washington, but sadly, the mobs of violent protestors who recently debased statues of our first president and founding father despise him and the nation he built.

The Fourth of July observes one of the most seismic shifts in human history. Before the Declaration of Independence, mankind was divided into nations by ethnicities and tribes. The Founding Fathers gave birth to a new type of nation. As G.K. Chesterton wrote, “America is the only nation in the world that is founded on a creed… It enunciates that all men are equal in their claim to justice, that governments exist to give them that justice, and that their authority is for that reason just.”

The miracle of the American experiment was not the result of a natural sequence of events. An exceptionally virtuous and educated cadre of statesmen broke away from the politics of millennia and created something new. Only by this political miracle do Americans enjoy our freedoms. It is on the virtue and sacrifice of the founding fathers and the numerous men and women who carry on their legacy that America is still free today.

It should be no surprise that George Washington receives such a special vitriol from the lawless mobs, as he was the paradigm of our founding fathers. Under Washington, the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness were realized. He mobilized volunteers to enforce our rights against the world’s preeminent superpower. His soldiers and ragtag militiamen routed a king’s army and navy.

Yet, when Washington’s power reached its maximum, he gifted it away. By the time Washington became president, this was the least impressive item on his résumé. But even in that endeavor, he set the gold standard for statesmanship. Washington again voluntarily relinquished his power after two terms in office, inaugurating a foundational democratic principle that has lasted centuries.

To this day, American citizenship remains the most valuable privilege anyone can possess. American citizens enjoy protection under the rule of law and the right to live in a society where anyone can pursue the American Dream—brought to you in part by Washington himself. As just a small tribute to his immeasurable contribution to the nation and the world, our capital and the tallest structure in it are named for him.

However, his role in shaping this country is precisely the reason so many hate him and want to expunge our cities of this champion of liberty. In Portland, Oregon, a violent mob recently draped an American flag over the face of a George Washington statue, toppled it, and set it on fire. No American should loathe the man who ended monarchy. No “de-colonizer” should diminish the first—and most successful—revolution against colonialism.

The violent mob is not worthy of even polishing Washington’s statue, let alone desecrating it. But they don’t stop there. In a bizarre turn of events, they have also vandalized statues memorializing abolitionists, Union soldiers, and Ulysses S. Grant.

They even threaten a 19th-century statue of Abraham Lincoln that was dedicated by abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass and financed by donations from freed slaves. These heroes ended slavery and knew racial oppression more intimately than modern-day rioters do. Their only crime is not submitting to the standards of the woke mob sometimes more than 100 years after their time.

In contrast to peaceful protestors exercising their First Amendment rights, violent protestors defiling statues are no better than the looters and rioters who ransacked hundreds of small businesses, many of which are owned by minorities, across the country under the guise of racial justice protests. But the symbolic destruction of monuments benefits nobody and only robs future generations of Americans of the ability to pay their respects to our country’s great leaders.

When we wash away history, we wash away inquiry, and we wash away the truth. But it is truth, transparency, and debate that increase our understanding of what is right. Good people must not stoop to the mob.

Some in the mob worship a statue of Vladimir Lenin in Seattle. Lenin represents untold repression, ethnic cleansing, and the mass killings of millions of his countrymen. Let it stand as a testament to their self-contradictions and a memorial to the historical evil that Lenin and his modern-day successors represent.

And when someone tries to desecrate a statue of the guardians of America’s foundational principles, make no mistake: they attack America itself. Police must protect public property. Prosecutors must punish perpetrators. Politicians must neither placate nor patronize these pillagers.

President Trump has led a firm response to the lawlessness sweeping our nation. The Department of Homeland Security is following his lead in deploying special units to defend our national treasures from rioters. Rest assured, we will leverage every tool and authority in our arsenal to make sure these landmarks remain intact for our grandchildren and great-grandchildren to learn from so they can carry on America’s great legacy.

Tucker Carlson: 'You Shouldn't Wait To Say What You Think Is True',"Top-rated cable news talk show host Tucker Carlson joined Chris Bedford on The Federalist Radio Hour this week. Listen to the show below or read the transcript below that. The transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.

CB: Hello, everyone, and welcome back to another edition of The Federalist Radio Hour. I’m Christopher Bedford and joining me today is Tucker Carlson, host of “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” which this week broke the record for most-watched cable news show ever. Thank you so much for being here with us, Tucker.

TC: Are you kidding? It’s my honor.

CB: So your show has become the most watched over the past quarter, especially because you’re saying something that no one else is saying. You’re calling out the elites of both parties, Democrats and Republicans. You’re calling out Washington think tanks, you’re calling out the local mayors and attorney general, and prosecutors all over the country, for failing to do their job in the face of the mob.

You’re going forward like someone who thinks that maybe television is a fleeting thing and you’re pouring your entire heart and soul into it. What about this moment is drawing you to it, and [why is] what you’ve been offering is drawing in such record numbers of viewers who are watching?

TC: You know me well. I do think television is a fleeting thing. I think life is a fleeting thing. I’ve been meditating for some reason, I don’t know why, on something of all people Conan O’Brien once said. I’m not a Conan O’Brien fan, but he said something that never left me, which is, ‘In the end, all graves go unvisited.’ I think that every day.

So I mean, that kind of centers you in reality, like staring at the night sky and you begin to suspect that maybe you’re not the center of the universe. So yeah, I mean, when we just lost a mutual friend of ours this week. So there’s reminders all around us that things change faster unexpectedly and you move from one position to another and then you’re done.

And so, my feeling, based on that, is that you shouldn’t wait to say what you think is true. You should say it now. And that’s not hard in this moment, because the stakes are so clearly high, the highest they’ve been in my lifetime.

I mean, part of the problem with journalism and particularly television, is that it torques up the emotional intensity to the point where you lose perspective. You can become paranoid or overwrought. That’s why I fly fish and try to spend time with my wife and kids.

So I keep asking myself every day, am I losing perspective? Am I making more of this than I ought to be? In 15 years, will we all recognize that this was an important moment, a pivotal moment? And I think the answer is, there really is a lot going on now. There is a revolution in progress.

I can’t stop it. I’m just a talk show host, but I can certainly say what I think about it and encourage other people to do the same. I mean, again, this is a bias that’s inherent to my business that I think that change begins, always, when you describe what’s happening. Words are the seeds of action. And I’m just so struck by how few people have articulated what’s going on.

And it’s not that they don’t understand it. They do. They’re just too afraid. And I find that contemptible. I’m not particularly brave. I’ve never served in the military. I wouldn’t want to, you know I’d be afraid. So it’s not like I’m some particularly courageous person. I’m not. It’s just that so many people who should be brave are fleeing the scene, and that just didn’t enrages me.

I mean, it really is like watching absent fathers drink during the day and you keep thinking Where are your children? Where’s your wife? Like, why aren’t you doing your duty? How can you abandon them and continue to live with yourself?

That’s what I think of our leaders right now, almost all of them. You know what I mean, like we had a home invasion. You were the only one who could operate the shotgun, and you’re at the bar and turned your cell phone off, you know, when the kids got beaten up and mom got raped and they burned the house down. You know, because you left. You were supposed to protect us. I know that may sound melodramatic, but that’s actually how I feel about it.

CB: In the ’70s we saw this, in the late ’60s we saw this kind of violence in the United States and attempts to attack everything we stand for and occupy campuses. You talked about it in California with the university president.

But back then also in the ’60s and ;70s we had a Democratic Party that had Jefferson dinners and would hand out copies of the Constitution. The Republican Party had Lincoln dinners, handed out copies of the Constitution. Democratic mayors of major cities like Chicago who would not hesitate to use force to disperse a violent mob, and Washington was respected.

Today, when Washington’s torn down, what struck me and I wrote about it The Federalist, how reminiscent it was of the revolution in China, when Mao in the Cultural Revolution had Confucius’ entire family’s graves dug up, and desecrated, and robbed and destroyed — this is essentially their religion for a thousand years. And it the whole people of China know that if this can happen to Confucius, if we can do this to Confucius, we could do this to you or to anyone we want.

TC: Well, that’s exactly right, and that’s the point. And it’s funny you mentioned the turmoil of 50 years ago, because I was just reading about it. My father was a reporter in San Francisco from 1963 until the mid ’70s for ABC News, so he was there for all of that, right in the center of where it was happening.

And he kept detailed notes and they’re all in bound books, and they happen to be in our barn in Maine, and literally an hour ago, I was sitting at the kitchen table there having a cup of coffee, reading one of his notebooks from the summer of, the winter of 1968.

And he covered a riot at San Francisco State that later became famous because the president of the university, S.I. Hayakawa, stood up to the rioters and was rewarded for it. He was later elected senator from California. But the point is, reading these stories, it’s almost bewildering how closely the rhetoric tracks to what we’re hearing. Now, the difference, and this leaps off of every page, is that the people in charge, by and large, were not for it, when you had, you know, the so-called artistic creative community — you had Hollywood, book publishing, journalism — I mean, they were all [supporting] it, in some cases very for it.

But the people who ran American businesses were not for it at all. The head of General Motors was not cheering on the riots. And that just comes through in reading about it. Now, the most powerful people in America, literally the richest man in the world, Jeff Bezos, is funding the riots. Bezos owns the Washington Post, which is cheering on the rioters, helping the rioters think of new things to destroy.

He is not simply an accomplice. He’s a driver of this chaos and violence, and you have to ask yourself, why is that? Wy would people who seem to be so deeply vested in a society work to destroy that society? And it’s actually a quite a question and I don’t fully understand the answer, but it’s something worth ruminating.

Even more striking to me is that nobody says this. A classic revolution consists of people who believe they’re oppressed rebelling against the class above them. Right? You know, I want what you have therefore I’m going to rise up and take it. That’s how we understand revolution.

This is the first revolution I’ve ever heard of this aims downward. I mean, this is an attempt by the most privileged people in our society to crush and humiliate the least privileged in our society. Again, you have to wonder why. There’s something really ominous about that. There’s something really, in addition to, you know how sinister it is and how just immoral what they’ve done is, it’s just a level of kind of bad sportsmanship that I can’t even process. You know what I mean?

The middle of the country is dying. The middle class is dying. The American middle class for the first time in modern history has seen its life expectancy decline, mostly thanks to fentanyl but there are other factors too. So these are the people who have the least, who are in the worst shape, and yet they are the explicit target of the rage of the rioters who really are the ruling class.

I don’t understand that. Why would you attack the weakest in your society? It’s grotesque. It’s contemptible. I mean, there’s something in every person that kind of identifies with the classic revolutionary model, you know, I’m not going to take it anymore I’m going to go free to prisoners from the Bastille.

Even if you don’t support the French Revolution, you understand that impulse. You know, we’re overthrowing the king, I get it. You know, even monarchists understand why people want to overthrow kings. I don’t think normal people could even begin to understand why you would want to degrade and hurt people who are already dying.

CB: What strikes me about all this is, going back to the founding of the United States is something that the conservative movement has been trying to do for decades now. They raise money off of it, they release pamphlets on it, they hold seminars on it, they organize huge groups of people all across the country to support their work, and they’re about as wealthy as they’ve ever been. They’re all over Washington, DC. One has the largest campus of any private landowner in all of Capitol Hill, the Heritage Foundation, which you’ve gone after.

And today, we’ve seen such a switch. I just pulled up a fundraising letter from the Cato Institute, which is founded on returning to the Constitution, returning to America’s heritage, quote individual liberty free markets and constitutionally limited government. And their think tank down on Massachusetts Avenue was boarded up against rioters, and their scholars are tweeting at the rioters that they’re on their side and not sure why they’re being targeted at all.

The Heritage Foundation, which you’ve criticized in your show, they have a new campaign. They’re preaching to all the different conservative groups around Washington to get people to send in video messages of why they’re proud to be an American, and put yard signs in their front lawn, that says they’re proud to be an American. It’s something that people should do and it’s nice to see, but it doesn’t sync up quite with the largest private landowner on Capitol Hill, which stands for the Constitution and the founding, and was worth this much. It’s among the most powerful voices in the room.

What we hope to do — conservatives or people who are afraid, or people of all different political ideologies, we’re afraid of this mob. [Are] the powerful institutions here in DC just irrelevant now?

TC: Well, I mean, it depends upon whether the question refers to the short term, or the long term. Long term, this is a blessing. Because institutional conservatism has been revealed for all time to be utterly fatuous and corrupt. Pointless, in fact worse than pointless. Hilariously, ironically misguided.

I mean, the Heritage Foundation — where I worked, by the way. My first job was at their magazine, Policy Review. And for Cato. I never got paid by Cato, but I was friends with the head of Cato, a guy called Ed Crane was a good guy. I still like Ed Crane. And he gave me the title of visiting scholar or something. I’m not a scholar.

But anyways, the point is, it’s ridiculous. I mean, anyone who has lived in Washington knows this already. Probably the majority of conservatives in Washington work for one of these things. They all preach smaller government, they all grow, you know, quicker than any tumor, you know, themselves.

The whole thing is ridiculous, but what we found out when the chaos began, when things actually began to fall apart, was that not only were they not able to defend us, but they weren’t even interested. I mean the president of the Heritage Foundation, Kay Cole James. God knows what she makes. Her first instinct, when people started burning Wendy’s and beating up bystanders in the street, rioting, literally rioting, was to write a piece in USA Today attacking the United States as racist. And not just superficially racist but racist to its core, and attacking conservatives as racist.

So, it turns out that the president of the largest conservative think tank is on the side of Black Lives Matter. So what does that tell you? It tells you that there’s a profound misalignment between conservatives and the people who supposedly represent them, so profound that it just can’t continue. There’s no point to having the Heritage Foundation or Cato or AEI. I mean all these places are not just a joke, but they’re, they’re worse than that. They’re an abomination.

You know, we should have recognized that. I think most of us did recognize it, but it didn’t seem to matter at the time. But, places like the Heritage Foundation exist, they say, in order to come up with conservative ideas and craft conservative legislation. Obviously they failed in the latter, but the macro point is we already have conservative ideas. Let’s just stick with the Bill of Rights, how’s that?

So we don’t need a conservative foundation like the Heritage Foundation. What we need is a large conservative ACLU, we need a bodyguard. What’s the goal? The goal is to be able to live in the country if you dissent from Apple’s view of the world, or Jeff Bezos his view of the world.

You just want to live the life that you lived 15 years ago, I’m not talking about Antebellum America, I’m talking about, I don’t know, 2005 America. Let’s start there. I’d like to do that. I’d like to live in a country I can go to work, raise my kids, pretty much the way I want to. Not have to hear lectures from self-righteous, dumb people who hate me every day. Not feel like every power center in American life has, you know, it’s muzzle-trained on me.

And that’s very much the experience of living here right now if you disagree with the dogma, and of course I do. So maybe these institutions, which have consumed, literally, and I checked, billions of donor dollars over the years, maybe they can reorient their mission to make it possible to live in this country, if you’re conservative, or even moderately conservative. How about non-crazy?

CB: Do you think they can?

TC: Well, they’re going to. They’re going to and the Republican Party is going to do exactly the same. This is not speculation. It’s a statement of fact, and the reason they’re going to is because people are going to make them. So Kay Cole James is not going to run the Heritage Foundation a year from now and if she does then conservatives deserve it.

You know, Kay Cole James did not create the Heritage Foundation. Their so-called scholars, the ones who are, you know, God knows what they’re pushing, socialized medicine or whatever. Very non-traditional ideas tend to come out of these think tanks, pretty non-conservative ideas. These people didn’t create the institution. Conservatives did.

Mitch McConnell didn’t create the United States Senate. He didn’t create the Republican Party, neither did Kevin McCarthy. Conservatives did. So it’s just a matter of taking back these institutions for the people for whom they were designed and running them as they were meant to be run, which is to say, on the side of the people who pay for them, whose votes allow them to exist. Right? Just half of their own people, their own voters. It’s not hard.

CB: Ever since Bill Buckley and probably before him, people have been talking about how to change the institutions of college, universities, and education. His answer was, at least start by not sending in your money, not funding this thing.

As you’ve said, it’s great to send your kids to Duke but you have to wonder what your kids are being taught before you send them money. Is there a way, do you see any hope for this changing, and the direction of the party, and the think tanks and the conservative DC establishment, changing in any way other than just the long, slow, probably futile slog of trying to defund them?

TC: Oh no. Well, one, I don’t think you have to wonder what your kids are learning at Duke. If they’re taking liberal arts you know for certain they are being destroyed at Duke. Duke is destroying your children. It’s wrecking them. It’s making them hate you, it’s making them hate the country, and worst of all, it’s making them hate themselves.

And so we don’t have to guess about that anymore, it’s very obvious, the mask is off. And that is, I mean, if there’s one thing I’m hopeful about it’s people understanding what’s happening. When things get this radical, there’s no pretending that you know we’re watching a national consensus unfold. No! We’re watching the country, held hostage by a small group of deeply unhappy lunatics who hate everyone else. And no one can deny that. The only people who can deny that other people are paying no attention whatsoever.

But, you know, this is an evangelical faith we’re watching. This is a religious movement, these are evangelicals. It’s not enough for them to take power, they have to make certain that you agree with them. And so when they do take power — it looks like they will — they’re going to force the rest of the country, not simply to obey, but to mouth the lyrics. To, you know, to read the catechism. To nod in their struggle sessions and say, ‘Yes I was wrong, this is what I now believe.’

I mean, that’s their nature. That’s who they are, that’s going to happen. So, once it does happen and to some extent it’s already happening right now today, this afternoon. Once it does happen, nobody can kind of pretend that, you know, things are sort of humming along, maybe not quite due north, but close enough.

I mean there’s no more pretending. In a crisis, anyone who won’t defend you is with the enemy. Period. I know Kay Cole James, and she’s perfectly nice person. I’m not against her as a person. You know I’m not against Ron Johnson, you know, I’m not against Jim Lankford, two United States senators who today introduced legislation to abolish Columbus Day.

CB: Well you have to keep up economic productivity when you give away Juneteenth. I think that was their argument, right?

TC: Their argument is immaterial.

CB: It’s insane.

TC: A mob of revolutionaries are trying to eliminate American history. Why are they doing that? Not because they don’t like the aesthetics of the Columbus statue. No, they’re doing it because they understand that when you eliminate people’s past, you get to control their future. It’s a power grab.

If anyone doesn’t understand that, and anyone who plays along, wittingly or not, is your enemy. Period. So, I mean that’s just what it is. It, kind of, it all becomes very clear. So I’m happy about that because we don’t have to guess.

And I know Ron Johnson and I know Jim Lankford, and I like them both. I think Lankford’s legitimately smart, represents maybe the most conservative state of the union. But doing something like this puts Jim Lankford, you know, on the wrong side. The mob shows up at my house, I know for a dead certainty that Jim Lankford is not going to get out of the chair to save me or my family. Period. And therefore, Jim Lankford is not my friend. Jim Lankford is, in this moment, my enemy. Not personally, but factually.

So, I’m really happy about that. We don’t have to think I wonder if Kay Cole James, you know, is really on my side. Oh, no, we know that she wrote an op-ed in USA Today. And we can move forward with that understanding. It’s not even ideological.

So the debates that Bill Buckley engaged in all those years were really interesting, and I followed all of them and I always admired him. They were essentially ideological. This is a post-ideological moment. There’s not, you know, we’re not defending. You know this is not a transubstantiation debate, right, or this isn’t, you know, here’s the Laffer Curve. Okay, this is Do you get to live here or not?

And anyone who doesn’t see that — once again, sorry to repeat myself — is your enemy. Anyone in a position of authority or power who doesn’t see that. We’re going to the only institution in American life, the only power center, available to conservatives and — Trust me, my strike zone for conservatives is very, very wide, all the way from Angela Nagle who’s a leftist, you know, all the way to you, who is a very, kind of, traditional conservative. That whole spectrum. The whole now very wide category.

Matt Taibbi is in it. Glenn Greenwald is in it. I mean, these are left wingers, okay, but they dissent. Are they, are you, am I, are we going to get to live in this country? Period. So anyway, I’m prone to long-winded answers, but the answer is I’m really happy that we now know who’s on our side.

CB: And you sound optimistic that it will change the organizations that have traditionally been considered and that fundraise off of being there with conservatives will change and change quickly, because as you said, because they have to.

TC: Oh yeah, they’re absolutely going to have to. I mean, of course. In the case of the Heritage Foundation, you know, I think that Kay Cole James is a sincere person, probably. I mean I give everyone the benefit of the doubt, and I’ve always liked her just fine. But, you know, she couldn’t have made it clearer.

And by the way I did a segment on it because I was really offended, and I didn’t just go after her. I went after a bunch of different — Nikki Haley and a bunch of other so-called conservative leaders who, the second the fire started, whipped around and pointing the finger at conservatives. Called them racist.

But within the moment I did that segment, Kay Cole James denounced me as a racist. As if, you know, the only reason that I might disagree with her behavior is because I don’t like black people. That just tells you how deep the corruption is. If the president of the Heritage Foundation has adopted the laziest, most poisonous kind of thinking, which is to reduce everything to race, then the institution itself is beyond saving. I mean, it’s just like completely rotten.

CB: But you don’t advocate for starting new ones?

TC: The edifice is useful. People who understand what we need to do need to move into the Heritage Foundation very, very soon, and take it over, and I think they will.

CB: And you don’t advocate them for — there’s a lot of folks who say, ‘oh abandon the commanding heights of the colleges, abandon the commanding heights of the education system, and abandon the commanding heights of the think tank world and to start again and try to defeat them.’ It’s extremely difficult, obviously. But you don’t advocate for that?

TC: Look, it takes centuries to build functioning and impressive institutions, of course. They’re not legacy institutions by accident, they’re legacy institutions because they have a legacy. So, you know, it’s a longitudinal process. And in point of fact I am for abandoning the universities. Most, not all, but most of them, I think should go out of business and [they would make] fantastic housing.

I mean, housing prices are really high. I don’t know why we shouldn’t be putting, I don’t know, every member of MS13 and their baby mamas in the administration buildings at Brown. I’m not joking. But institutions that purport to represent and defend conservatives, like the Republican Party, like the Heritage Foundation, like AEI. There are many others. I mean, there’s no reason conservatives should abandon their own institutions.

Again, the people who run those institutions didn’t build them, they don’t own them. I feel this way about the high school I went to, that every one of my family went to. It’s moving in a direction that I disagree with. And part of me thinks, Well, I’m not going to have anything to do with it. Part of me thinks the people moving in that direction, don’t they don’t own the school. It’s passing through their hands, just as all institutions do.

We intersect with them and then our places are taken by other people. We don’t have a right to destroy something we didn’t build. And, and I would say that Jim Lankford, you know, doesn’t have a right to the Republican Party. By the way, people like that are — [Senator] Mike Braun, we had Mike Braun on the other night, yes perfectly nice person. You know he’s a senator from Indiana, he endorsed Black Lives Matter.

I know plenty of people who are for Black Lives Matter. A lot of them are nice people. I’m not mad at them, I disagree. I think Black Lives Matter is poison. Okay, they have another view, that’s all right. But they’re not Republican senators. Their job isn’t to make it possible for my children to live in this country.

And he’s abandoned his job. He’s served his duty. And he should be bounced out of that position. He should lose a seat over that. And if I’m still on television, I’m going to do everything I possibly can to make sure that happens.

And the same for Jim Lankford. The same for anybody who refuses to defend his voters in a time of crisis, just back to what I said in the first five minutes. It’s like, dad abandoned the family, and now the family has fallen prey to the jackal. So whose fault is that? The jackal’s? No. It’s dad’s fault, because it was his job and he didn’t do it.

CB: There’s, there’s a pushback against trying to get involved by a lot of folks, a lot of normal people. A friend of mine’s father says the problem with voting a lot of time and volunteering at church is the people who have a lot of time to spend volunteering at church can be very difficult sometimes to deal with, because conservatives conservatives generally have not done the hard work and have left it up to the activists who’ve taken it over.

But when you’re surveying this elite ruling class revolution against the impoverished in the middle class of America, what do you see as the most powerful institutions — on the left, I’m not seeing anything on the right — but what on the left are the powerful institutions, the driving forces of revolution that they’ve managed to bring up since the ’30s, ’50s ’60s, ’70s, and to where they are today, where they run our streets?

TC: Well you know, it’s every institution depicted in American life. And I’m not going to rant about how Republicans failed to keep any of these institutions, because I spent my whole life doing that on television on that and I hate repeating myself.

CB: Of course.

TC: But clearly Republicans allowed all of this to happen. They focused all of their energy on tax rates, which, by the way, can be changed with a single vote. You know what I mean? You spend your life trying to change – and I’m for lower taxes and I’m not trying to make an argument going for higher taxes, I guess. I’m just saying talk about misapplied energy, talk about wasted time.

What they should have been doing is keeping a very close eye on the society itself, and how their voters were doing and how Americans were doing, and they didn’t. So if every power center in American life is arrayed on one side, obviously finance, tech, journalism, or mainstream religious institutions, our federal law enforcement agencies, the intelligence agencies, the Pentagon — absolutely the Pentagon, conservatives don’t want to admit that, but it’s true. We’ve allowed for years senior officers to get promotion credit by going to Princeton. Really? I mean what do you think that’s about? I mean that’s as captured an institution as we have.

Why do you think we’re still in Afghanistan, why do you think we bombed Syria twice? You know, these are ideologues, and they’re, they’re part of the blob. So, but if I were to create a hierarchy of power, obviously, the capstone in that pyramid would be Google. The most powerful company in the history of the world. Its power far outstrips that of the U.S. government because it controls all human information in English. And once you control the terms, you control the outcome. You control the information because of the words themselves.

Then there’s really nothing we don’t control, and they do. Their search engine, the Google search engine, is the portal through which more than 90 percent of all human information in English flows. So there’s nothing that compares to that. There’s never been a company that powerful. There’s never been a company close to as powerful.

I mean, William Randolph Hearst owned, I don’t know, a dozen newspapers. He was considered a threat to democracy because was too much power concentrated in the hands of one man. He was conservative, so that that’s why people were so alarmed. But magnify that influence times infinity and you approach where Google is now.

Now it’s a little late to be grousing about what we should have done. But clearly, the U.S. government’s legitimacy is imperiled by Google. You can’t have an institution in your country that’s more powerful than the government. Right? Or else you cease to be in any meaningful sense a democracy. And yet we’ve allowed Google to grow into that, abetted by the way by the U.S. Congress, as you know.

So anyway, yeah, I mean think it’d be very difficult for Trump to win an election with Google weighing in. I think it’s very difficult for the Congress to function as intended. And I think it’s very difficult for people who don’t agree with Google to have a voice. As long as Google is what it is.

CB: And it’s not exactly the kind of institution that can be replicated on the right.

TC: Right. I mean, like, I can’t even engage in this debate and this just shows you how bankrupt conservative institutions have become. You get this lecture about competition, it’s not a monopoly and Senator Mike Lee of Utah, a very smart guy and I’ve no doubt a decent person but utterly intellectually corrupt. I mean, utterly. You know, but giving you this lecture about how this is how markets work.

Well, there’s no intersection between monopolies and markets. Monopolies make markets impossible. I mean, by definition, Google is a monopoly. And no of course you can’t start your own Google and it’s insulting to suggest something like that.

I don’t like politicians, I never have. I know them all. I don’t admire any of them. Maybe the only politician is, other than George Washington, Teddy Roosevelt. And Teddy Roosevelt understood this and Teddy Roosevelt saved capitalism and made the middle class possible by reining in the power of the group we call the robber barons.

And watching New York decide to tear a statue down because racism, somehow, I’ve been so struck by how few conservatives have marched to the podium to defend Teddy Roosevelt. And then I remembered. Oh, of course, they hate Teddy Roosevelt, the most popular president in American history, because he questioned the monopolies.

And they’re all actually monopolists. They are, they’re not. They’re not market people. If they were in favor of free markets they’d be horrified by our tech sector, so many of which operate with effective monopolies. Ninety percent of all digital news is effectively controlled by Google and Facebook because they control digital advertising.

CB: I’ve lived it.

TC: That’s not a market. You’ve lived it, I have too. Consider the effect of that. If all your news organizations are controlled by two companies, that’s not a market. That’s Orwellian. That’s a nightmare.

And they’ve said nothing about it. I could pile on for hours about how unimpressive, and how derelict conservatives have been and I’ll stop but I just I just want to reiterate, this will change. These people have failed. You know, we had an acid test, and they were proved to be counterfeit. And they will be replaced.

CB: You had a great piece in Politico magazine years ago when Donald Trump ran for president, where you compared him favorably with Teddy Roosevelt, saying that the American people don’t appreciate a mob outside the mansion screaming that they want everything inside. But they do appreciate somebody inside the mansion taking a chair and throwing it to the window and stating this entire house is corrupt. That’s what Teddy Roosevelt was and that’s what you hoped Donald Trump would do as a traitor to his elite class.

He’s actually begun to move in that direction in the past week — I think in no small part because of you — and try to crack down and to bring in Bill Barr and bring in the influence of the United States as much as he can. Is the president actually able to have in real life an impact on this, when you’ve got a military that apologizes for him but he threatens use them, and a House and Senate that are largely silent?

And Tom Cotton goes out and writes an op-ed in The New York Times, Republicans don’t rush out to defend him but he’s stricken from their pages and they apologize. Are people like Trump and Cotton alone? Are the institutions of power so arrayed against them that they can’t even, they’re essentially neutered in their positions?

TC: No, they’re not neutered. Of course they have power. They have less power than they ought to have. In the case of the president, that’s his fault. You get what you put up with. You let your kids roll a joint at the breakfast table, the next thing they’re shooting heroin at the lunch table, of course. They’re your kids.

This is his administration. These are his generals. This is his FBI. This is his CIA. And if you spend four years letting them give you the finger, you shouldn’t be surprised when they burn your house down. So you get what you put up with. You can’t put up with that sh-t, not for one second. That’s my view, whatever.

But here we are. Of course he retains power. He’s the president of the United States. Simply saying aloud why this is bad is helpful. He’s doing that. I’m grateful, I think a lot of people are. But you also have this problem of justice — the most powerful law enforcement agency in the world, the FBI, under you. You run the FBI. It’s part of the executive branch for the president. So how hard can it be to arrest the perpetrator since the perpetrators are all on video?

All of it is knowable, all of it is provable. It was filmed. There’s never been a revolution televised like this one has been. So, sure, of course you can bring them to justice. There’s pushback, well nobody wants to do it. Well, okay, tough. We’re doing it. Period. Like now.

CB: And the voters want it.

TC: Yeah, of course the voters want it. And if you want to know why Trump has lost 10 points in the past month, it’s really simple. Riot and revolution, upheaval like this, cruelty — we’re seeing that on a mass scale — makes people’s lives worse.

I don’t think he should send the 82nd Airborne into Atlanta. I’m not saying that. It’s enough to arrest people, it’s enough to use the system.

By the way, if you don’t use the system, the system collapses. This is an attack on our system, particularly our justice system. The basic idea behind our justice system is we’re all equal under the law. Period. The law does not take into account who your parents were or what color you are. We haven’t always lived up to that, needless to say, but that’s the point of it. That’s why our justice system is different.

And Black Lives Matter and Antifa and their many enablers in the media and the Congress are trying to change that and replace it with a system that takes a lot of accounts of who your parents were and what you look like, and what your race is. And so if you want to stop that from happening — and I think we do because that would make America a country you don’t want to live in — then you use your system already in place for 240 years to stop it. And in doing that, you establish your legitimacy.

Right? In other words, when people see the leaders of Antifa in shackles, they will know the system is defending itself, and defending us from people who are seeking overthrow. If they don’t see that, if this stuff goes on unchallenged, then people begin to wonder why, why should I support the system? It’s impotent. It doesn’t work. It’s old. You know what I mean?

It’s sort of like, if you have a relative who you really respect, the second that person begins to show signs of senility you love them every bit as much, but you don’t seek their advice anymore. You can’t help it; you respect him less. Right? I’m not saying you leave them on an ice floe. But it’s just that’s human nature. We respect the strong. We have contempt for the weak. We’re animals.

You know, if you have two dogs and one of them is very sick, you don’t leave the dogs together because the healthy one will kill the sick one. That’s the dog’s instinct. Kill the weak. And there’s a little bit of that in all of us.

And if we forget that, then we make unwise decisions, and the unwise decision that our leaders have made is imagine that by accommodating the revolution, the revolution will be. And you know that’s not true. It’s the opposite of what’s true, and it suggests that they don’t really understand people very well.

CB: At least Jeff Bezos realizes that the best way to survive is to be at the front of the revolution.

TC: I mean, Jeff Bezos — online as a factual matter, as a matter of news. There are a lot of e-commerce businesses that are very vulnerable to social media pressure, of course. If you exist only online and you feel you’re being targeted by organized groups of people online, then you will bow to their to their will and that all makes sense. You’ve got a lot at stake.

Jeff Bezos has nothing to do. Jeff Bezos is literally the richest man in the history of the world. Jeff Bezos could probably do anything, and he’d still die as the richest person in the world. So why is he doing this? And I think there are a bunch of different reasons and I don’t fully understand it. I think part of it is, you know, destroying independent business increases market share. COVID and the riots have destroyed countless independent businesses, so it’s good for the bottom line for Jeff Bezos, but it’s deeper than that clearly.

And I think it has to do with the guilt that affluent Americans feel about the changes in our economy that basically have awarded smart people and screwed everybody else. And that’s why we have this really dramatic income inequality — which I wrote a whole book on, predicting you’re going to get a revolution and okay it happened. And I’m hardly a genius. It was just so obvious. What we’re looking at is a revolution, driven by economic anxiety and frustration over the way the fruits of our economy are distributed.

I mean that’s what’s really happening. I wish people would just say it. Anyway, whatever. So Jeff Bezos feels bad about it, but I do think guilt and self-hatred clearly play a role in our elite participation.

CB: So the tools exist as you said, 20 years ago Pat Buchanan was complaining about this when the NAACP attacked Bush’s cabinet appointees as ‘Taliban-wing’ and ‘extreme right’ and ‘devoted to the Confederacy.’ And he was sitting there longing for the moral certitude of, say, the anti-religious right Democratic Party.

He said that a party, a conservative party that believed in itself would have had the IRS look into the NAACP to make sure that partisan attacks weren’t a violation of its tax status, to cut off discretionary federal funds until the chairman was fired, to ask major corporations and donors if they stood by these kind of attacks on the president, to amend the tax laws to go after organizations like Ford.

But instead they wrote a letter saying that this was disappointing and asked to meet. Of course they were turned down. This is a longstanding problem, and you see that kind of return to the certainty and the fighting faith, after this rebellion, after we’ve reached rock bottom, the conservatives who realize — and as you say, anyone who thinks the founding of this country is good, this is an inherently just and free society that’s just worth defending, anyone conservative, liberal — this might reinvigorate that spirit to stand up and fight with moral certitude again?

TC: Well, it’s hard to know. I mean one thing we do know is that crisis, high levels of stress, change people. So you’re not the same after it happened. And I’m sure you could go through your own life and think of the moments where something really stressful occurred in your life and then two years later you’re really not the same person. So, we know that things will be very, very different after this, the question is, how?

And, look, I mean, let’s be honest, what you’re seeing is the people in charge, trying to cement a kind of race war. That’s the left doing this. Attacking people for their skin color, really attacking them, really attacking them in ways that are dangerous that suggest that we want to, we want to really hurt you physically, saying that. Because of how you were born.

So there’s really nothing more threatening. What’s the effect going to be? Well, I keep thinking that they clearly want to create really radical race politics, because you wouldn’t do this unless you wanted to create really radical race politics, because by doing it, you are going to create radical race politics. And by radical race politics I mean politics in which people would identify first and foremost by their skin color. You know, I am this party because I am this color.

I cannot be emphatic enough: I don’t want to live in that country. Because it doesn’t end well. It never ends well.

CB: Sounds like South Africa.

TC: People don’t actually coexist peacefully under those terms. One side has to vanquish the other and that suggests violence and that’s why there is violence when you have tribalism. So I don’t want that. I think it’s bad. B

ut if they don’t stop right now, we’re going to get that, because how could we not get that. They’re saying you’re required to think of yourself first and foremost as a person who possesses your skin color. That’s the most important thing about you: what color you are. They’re like crazed, wild-eyed racists, obviously.

And if you keep telling people that, and you tell their children that, after a while, they will begin to think about themselves primarily as who they are racially. And so anyway, God knows what happens when that starts. I mean, seriously, but they. Anyway, I have a lot to say about that, but I’ll stop there.

I think the only answer at this point, and I keep saying this on TV, no one else seems to say it along with me, but the only answer is to fall back on our fundamental defense, which is the country itself. Its customs. Its founding documents. We should, as non-revolutionaries, say out loud, every day: ‘We want this to be a colorblind meritocracy.’

A colorblind meritocracy where you’re not judged in the eyes of the law for how you look, for who your parents were, but for what you do. Make no accommodation whatsoever. If you want to live in a just society, a non-racist society. Everyone’s pushing this ‘I want to live in a nonracist society.’ Okay, well what does that look like? A nonracist society is a society in which you are not judged for your race, by definition, so let’s stop judging people. Period.

CB: Our newest monument in the National Mall was Martin Luther King, who gave that famous speech at the Lincoln Monument. But on Tuesday night, you outlined a Republican platform that you think is something that they’d need to stand for, something very positive.

And to break it down quite more quickly than you did, or more succinctly I guess, would be a vigorous defense of total quality, like you just spoke about: defense of freedom of speech, vigorous, unending defense of freedom of speech, and of middle class at the core, not rich corporations and not simply pandering to the working core, but a middle class which forms a strong America. So, when are you going to run on that platform?

TC: Well, I’m not running on anything. I would be assassinated if I ran. Not by Democrats, but by my daughters who are basically nonviolent. You know, no, I’m a talk show host. That’s my job, it’s what I enjoy doing, it’s what I’ve always done, so I’m going to keep doing that.

But I do think we’ve gotten to a place where people just accept that we live in a society where your kids aren’t going to get certain jobs or get into a certain school because of their skin color. And I feel like thanks to the whole country, people of all colors, listen to yourself. Listen to what you’re saying. That’s grotesque.

Slavery and segregation were immoral because they judge people for the color of their skin, and yet we’re all accepting and participating in a system where that’s the rule. And why are we doing that? And why are conservatives going along with it and boy, are they.

I can’t remember the last time I heard a conservative say, ‘No, your race should have no role in whether you’re hired.’ If should have no role in what you’re getting into college, which we, I guess still accept is the is the ladder to success. Like why, really? Why are we accepting that? It’s totally immoral. And so I hope people will say that, ‘Yeah, I want to live in a nonracist society.’ But in order to do that you have to try, and trying means moving race from its position of primacy back out to the periphery where it belongs.

You know, this guy’s an amazing engineer, he happens to be Filipino or whatever, I don’t care. That’s the country you want to live in. You don’t want to live in a country that says ‘I need three Filipino engineers.’ That’s insane. You know that’s apartheid South Africa. You know what I mean, Tuscaloosa 1950. You don’t want that. Why do we want that? I don’t want that and I’ll never accept that.

And I don’t care what name they call me. I will never accept that. I think it’s wrong. And by the way, I will say one more time. If we keep this crap up, I’m telling you, we’re going to have a very ugly political landscape. I mean, I mean it too. Because some people are going to say, you know what, screw it. Guys want me to think of myself in terms of my skin color. Now I do, and all people who look like me need to come together. And then we’re going to take up arms or what, you know, God knows where it will go. Don’t do this.

They’re so reckless, the people doing this. They’re children. They should have no access to the levers of power.

CB: Well, Tucker, you’ve got a show to get to, so I won’t keep you much longer. Have a happy July Fourth. I hope you get to spend it relaxed, away from this with the rest of the country on a weekend with family and friends remembering the reason why we’re proud and the things we’re fighting for.

TC: I will be waist deep in a trout stream. Fortunately, it’s getting to a dry fly season here in Maine, so I will be throwing large mayfly invitations at hungry brook trout. Say a prayer.

CB: I will, for them and for you and, and hopefully at least dinner with the family.

TC: Amen.

An Attack On Goya Is An Attack On U.S. Hispanics,"As a first-generation Cuban American raised on Goya products, it is revolting to see the far-left’s attack on the largest Hispanic-owned business in the United States, simply for supporting President Trump’s Hispanic Prosperity Initiative. This is an initiative to help communities like mine obtain better access to educational and economic opportunities.

Goya has an impressive history of helping Hispanics like myself. They have helped families, students, churches, Hurricane Maria victims in Puerto Rico, and even orphanages. Last year, President Trump helped Goya’s charitable arm, Goya Gives, successfully deliver truckloads of food to Venezuelans who are starving under the Nicolas Maduro regime.

This week as part of the Hispanic Prosperity Initiative, Goya announced its donation of one million cans of food, and one million pounds of product to food banks across the United States, which would benefit individuals and families in need as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Goya has not only given back to the people from my community, but it’s also a staple of Hispanic culture. I grew up on Goya and I’ll never forget my abuela repeating their popular slogan: Si es Goya, tiene que ser bueno (If it’s Goya, it has to be good).

Democrats should know how important Goya is to Hispanic families, which is why it’s dumb to see liberals line up to boycott a company that helps minority communities. Goya doesn’t ask about a family’s political affiliation when they give scholarships to kids, nor do they care whether it’s a blue or red state they’re helping with disaster relief efforts. In fact, in 2011, Goya worked with and supported former first lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move campaign.

Liberals claim they care about Hispanics, yet they’re trying to “cancel” a company that means so much to people like my family and me. They care more about political ideology than actual results. One could easily argue that Goya CEO Robert Unanue has done more to help Hispanic Americans than any politician, from either party.

The mainstream media may like the spectacle of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ana Navarro-Cardenas, and Julian Castro attacking Goya, but they do not speak for me and they certainly do not speak for all Hispanics. They, and those who think like them, like to talk a big game about “privilege.” Well, imagine the “privilege” required to lead a boycott against a company that literally puts food on the tables of Hispanic families, just because you disagree with something its CEO said.

There is also an absurd double standard. In 2011, Unanue introduced President Obama at a reception in the White House, where he said he was “honored and humbled” to be a part of those gathered for a Hispanic Heritage Month celebration while the Obama-Biden administration was deporting Hispanics in record numbers. Where was the outrage then?

Of course, there wasn’t any, because “cancel culture” is a political tool for the left to use against its opponents.

Growing up, my grandparents were restaurant owners, and homemade Cuban meals using Goya products were not only their livelihood but also the bond that brought our multigenerational family together every weekend. I’ve been fortunate to have more than 40 family recipes handed down to me, and every time I make one, I am reminded of my heritage and what my family has accomplished in this country. From arroz con pollo to black beans and rice, for more than 32 years my family and I have turned to Goya for a taste of tradition.

The story of Goya is rooted in the American Dream, where hard work and perseverance allow you to achieve your version of success regardless of who you are. That is the dream my parents had when they immigrated to the United States from Cuba in 1985, and that is the same dream I share with my children.

Food does not have to be political, but with extremists attacking a company whose products I grew up on, my family and I, like many others in South Florida, will not only continue to buy Goya’s products, we will double down on them. My parents risked everything to live in freedom, and I will not remain silent, because an attack on Goya is an attack on Hispanic families like mine.

"Catholic Churches And Statues Burned, Vandalized In String Of Targeted Attacks","Catholic churches and religious statues across the country were the target of vandalism, terrorism, and potential arson this last week as tensions concerning the removal of historical statues continue to rise.

In Boston at St. Peter’s Parish Church, parts of a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary were scorched after being lit aflame. According to some at the Boston Fire Department Fire Investigation Unit, “an unknown suspect had set fire to plastic flowers, which were in the hands of the statue, causing the face and upper body of the statue to be burned.”

“Whoever is responsible for the desecration of the Holy Mother’s statue is clearly a troubled soul,” Secretary for Communications & Public Affairs for the Archdiocese of Boston, Terrence C. Donilon, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Mary represents all that is good and pure in our world. We have confidence in local law enforcement to investigate this matter. We pray for the person or persons responsible.”

The CLA Executive Director C. J. Doyle also addressed the recent attack, calling for a hate crime investigation.

“The object and timing of this attack is suspicious. The number and frequency of these incidents have increased in recent years, particularly in southern New England. Without jumping to conclusions beforehand, a hate crime investigation is, in this case, certainly warranted,” he said.

In Brooklyn, a statue of the Virgin Mary at Cathedral Prep School and Seminary in Queens also suffered an attack when an individual smeared it with the word “IDOL.”

Fr. James Kuroly, rector and president of Cathedral Prep, told Catholic News Agency that the desecration of the 100-year-old statue was an “act of vandalism and hatred.”

“Obviously, this tragedy saddens us deeply but it also renews our hope and faith in the Lord as he has shown his goodness in the many people who have already reached out to us,” said Fr. Kuroly. “We are sincerely grateful for the help we have received as well as the prayers. Please continue praying for those who committed this act of vandalism and hatred toward Our Lady and the Church.”

In Ocala, Florida, police arrested a man who lit the Queen of Peace Catholic Church on fire and crashed into the church with his minivan. According to the Marion County Sheriff’s office, Stephen Anthony Shields “poured gasoline in the church’s foyer and ignited it, after crashing his minivan through the parish’s front door” while parishioners gathered inside for mass.

According to the Catholic News Agency, the police charged him “with attempted murder, arson, burglary, and evading arrest” after “Shields told police he has been diagnosed with schizophrenia but is not currently taking prescribed medication” and that his attack was his “mission.”

“Our freedom of worship granted in the Constitution is a freedom that we all hold dear,” said Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods. “My deputies and I are sworn to protect that right and will always ensure our citizens can worship in peace. I’m proud of my deputies for capturing this man so quickly and we appreciate the assistance from all of the state and federal agencies that worked alongside of us during this investigation.”

A man in Ocala, Florida drove a van into a Catholic Church and set it on fire while people were inside, but you'd never know because the MSM isn't reporting on it. This is an act of terrorism that needs to be at the front of the headlines. Why is hate against Catholics ignored? pic.twitter.com/xxjVjhfFHL — Liberty Hangout (@LibertyHangout) July 11, 2020

In Los Angeles, a fire destroyed most of the historic San Gabriel Mission which was founded by St. Junipero Serra.

Archbishop José Gomez, the 5th and current Archbishop of Los Angeles, announced the fire on Twitter and asked for prayers from St. Junipero Serra.

“Our beloved #SanGabrielMission, founded in 1771, devastated by fire before dawn. St. Junípero Serra, pray for this land that you helped to found,” he wrote.

Our beloved #SanGabrielMission, founded in 1771, devastated by fire before dawn. St. Junípero Serra, pray for this land that you helped to found. pic.twitter.com/aX0X4qCvJ7 — Abp. José H. Gomez (@ArchbishopGomez) July 11, 2020

The cause of the fire is currently unknown, but is being investigated by the San Gabriel Fire Department. According to Capt. Antonio Negrete of the department, “recent vandalism throughout the region regarding Father Junipero Serra” also sparked an investigation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

The LAist reports that “the mission recently removed its bronze Serra statue from public view as a precaution” because “anger over the mission founder has led to questions as to whether the blaze that destroyed the mission’s roof and much of the interior was purposely set.”

A news release by the Catholic Action League condemned the recent attacks and called the case of arson in Boston a “lawless and malicious act of violence intended not only to destroy a venerable representation of the Mother of God, but, it would seem, to inflict needless pain and grief on innocent people who never did the malefactor any harm.”

Doyle also added that he believes that the timing of these incidents is not a coincidence and that the church deserves the defense of public officials.

“Given the climate of the country, where violent mobs of extremists are, increasingly, aggressive and emboldened in destroying historic monuments and religious iconography, public officials must remain vigilant in safeguarding the constitutionally guaranteed right to the free exercise of religion, which, necessarily, includes the right of churches to have their property protected,” Doyle said.

"179 Monuments Ruined Since Protests Began, And Counting","Thirty-three statues of Columbus. Nine of the Founding Fathers. Eight of Saint Junipero Serra. With the frequency of the ongoing iconoclasm, it can be hard to gain a scale of the problem.

For each story that has breached the news cycle, at least a dozen went unreported outside of local media. This detailed list records each instance monuments have been defaced, vandalized, and or torn down since nationwide protests began, updated as more occur.

Some key takeaways include:

At least 183 monuments, memorials, statues, and major historical markers have been defaced or pulled down since protests began in May.

While Confederate monuments have taken the lion’s share of media coverage, they actually form a minority of the statues targeted.

By far the most popular target was Christopher Columbus, with 33 statues in total having been defaced and pulled down.

The next most popular targets were Robert E. Lee (9), Serra (8), and Thomas Jefferson (4).

The vast majority of the vandals were never charged, with 177 out of 183 instances having no arrests.

Most monuments torn down were not by protesters, but by city officials after pressure or threats from protesters.

By far the most common route for monuments being destroyed was for protesters to damage it, then the city quickly removing it as a “public safety” hazard, not to be returned.

For a majority of the statues removed, the fate of the artwork is currently unknown, while a minority have been moved to cemeteries and museums.

The list begins with the most recent instance of iconoclasm and continues backwards in time until the first instance connected with nationwide rioting, in late May.

Suspect In Delaware Church Burning Says He Acted Out Of ‘Vengeance And Anger’,"Details are emerging about the recent torching of a Presbyterian church in Delaware, including documents about the attacker’s motive. A suspect found and arrested by law enforcement made unsolicited statements confirming he had “burned the church,” and that he had set the sanctuary on fire “out of vengeance and anger.”

The attack happened late Monday night when the suspect broke into Reach Church in Bear, Delaware, and proceeded to trash the interior before setting numerous fires across the sanctuary. Firefighters were able to control the blaze after is caused extensive internal damage, though they had to drill into the church’s steeple to do so.

Total damage to the worship place has been estimated at $250,000.

Despite the nature of the attack, the congregation has come together in public gatherings to pray for the suspect, going as far as welcoming the man to join the community in worship. Pastor Chuck Betters quoted Matthew 5:44 in his response to the attack; “love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.” Betters vowed the sanctuary will be rebuilt.

The attack on the Delaware church the latest in a string of attacks against houses of worship in recent weeks, though it is one of the first to target a protestant denomination.

In other recent targeted incidents, potential causes include anger over reopening during Covid, association with figures deemed unacceptable by protesters (such as St. Junipero Serra), and general anti-Catholic hate. Officials involved in the Delaware investigation have yet to state whether the suspect will be charged with a hate crime.

"Corporate Media Is Ignoring Riots, But Americans Hurt By Them Aren't","We are now approaching the two-month mark since the riots that erupted across the United States in late May and early June. There is a reasonable argument to be made that these riots were unprecedented in U.S. history — or at the very least, since the 1960s. Yet if one surveyed the national media today, you’d barely even know anything happened. Nor would you likely be aware that those who bore the brunt of the destruction — largely minorities whose sensibilities don’t fit into any neatly-delineated ideological category — are still acutely suffering from the fallout.

Yes, civil unrest has of course occurred before. But the riots of 2020 exhibited features which belie any easy historical parallel. For one thing, consider their enormous geographic scope.

While the most extreme riots in cities like New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and particularly Minneapolis did receive considerable attention — however fleeting, incomplete, and unnecessarily inflected with knee-jerk partisanship — there were also smaller-scale riots in surprisingly far-flung places that you hardly would’ve known about unless you lived in the area, happened to visit, or intentionally sought out what remains of the bare-bones local media coverage.

To take just a small sampling: Atlantic City, NJ, Fort Wayne, IN, Green Bay, WI, and Olympia, WA all underwent significant riots, at least per the normal expectations of life in these relatively low-key cities. Did you hear anything about them? Because I hadn’t, and I’m abnormally attuned to daily media coverage. Only because I personally visited did I learn of the damage.

These riots exploded with such intensity, across so many jurisdictions, and within such a contained period of time — roughly speaking, a one-week stretch beginning May 28, the day the chaos in Minneapolis/St. Paul reached a grisly apex — that no other instance of past civil unrest seems quite analogous. Complicating matters is that the riots occurred in tandem with a protest movement now believed to be the largest ever in U.S. history — one which saw demonstrations, vigils, and general rancor extend even into the most unassuming expanses of suburban and rural America.

This Is a Lot Bigger than the Media Is Letting On

On some level, you can understand why the ramifications of all this are still yet to be fully processed. The sheer volume of information is overwhelming, for one thing. And coupled with a worsening pandemic, along with the daily antics of Donald Trump, sustaining national attention on any given topic might be impossible.

But it’s also clear that the severe ramifications of these riots have been widely ignored — if not consciously obfuscated — by a media class that was near-unanimous in its approval of the accompanying protest movement. That they could have so quickly “moved on,” particularly from the wreckage of Minneapolis/St. Paul — where residents commonly told me that their lives are still in “agony” — is galling.

It doesn’t take some kind of profound journalistic acuity to walk around riot-affected areas, talk to citizens, record their stories and impressions, take some photos and record some video, and compose some tweets. And yet, I heard from hundreds of people across the United States and world who were shocked that they’d have never been aware of what happened in Minneapolis/St. Paul if not for my dinky little Twitter thread.

When I visited a month after the peak of the riots, much of this major American metropolis still lay in ruins. Not that normal life hadn’t mostly resumed; it had. But it’s resumed in the way that war-torn areas configure some ad hoc routine that enables the resumption of semi-normal activity amidst the rubble and despair.

Nobody Amplifying These Underrepresented Voices

In speaking with locals, many of whom have lost their livelihoods or had to plead for their children not to be burned alive, it often seems like the extent of the ruination they’ve experienced was barely ever appreciated in the first place. There are several potential explanations for why.

The media, in its characteristic insularity and myopia, has instead chosen to pathologically fixate on a constant stream of Culture War inanities that stem loosely from this ongoing “movement” — such as the propriety of various statues and monuments, whether various food brands and sports teams are racist, and whether various micro-celebrities need to be “canceled” for some imagined transgression. They are also beset by the various hyper-moralizing staff revolts within their own elite institutions, leading them to adopt an inordinately “inward” editorial disposition on account of their own neurotic personnel issues. Under these narcissistic conditions, real-world human suffering becomes less of a pressing concern. Journalists, editors, and pundits believe — either consciously or subconsciously, probably some half-scandalous combination of the two — that highlighting the harmful after-effects of these historic nationwide riots would somehow redound to the political benefit of Trump, which to them would be the most disastrous outcome of all. This probably isn’t even correct — Trump is currently seizing every opportunity to shoot himself in the foot all on his own — but the media class is nonetheless mortified to even contemplate the possibility that anything they might do could conceivably “help” him. These same media class members are themselves deeply invested in what they regard as “the movement,” however diffuse and ill-defined this “movement” may be, and they are extremely reluctant to produce any coverage which might reflect poorly on said “movement” and potentially undermine its moral and political legitimacy.

I don’t claim to have a complete answer for what explains this dynamic. But what I can do is simply share some of my observations and encounters. Then you can decide for yourself whether there’s been a conspicuous paucity of coverage — and if, say, a “national conversation” is warranted.

Let’s Look at America Outside the News

Numerous establishments were boarded up in Atlantic City, NJ in June. Just off the boardwalk, an Arab grocery store owner told me about how his storefront window was smashed by a rioter wielding a baseball bat as he was working. The riots came just as much of the city was preparing to partially re-open from COVID for the summer beach season.

Fort Wayne, IN doesn’t immediately come to mind as a likely candidate for a riot location, but one nonetheless took place. A coffee shop employee told me that their window was smashed by white kids with skateboards. As in many other places, the resulting plywood has served as a canvas for a city-sanctioned communal art project.

Similarly in Green Bay, WI, residents could not recall anything even approaching a riot ever occurring before. Here, the manager of a small tobacco and convenience shop displays photos of the damage taken for insurance purposes. Nearby, the windows of a Post Office were smashed.

A music shop owner in Olympia, WA told me that while his window was smashed, he also felt moved to put up the plywood boards “in solidarity” with the “movement,” to again provide protesters with a canvas for their art projects.

So many of the people I’ve encountered across the country were perfectly happy to talk about their experiences in the last two months, although many did not want to go on-record for understandable reasons. Still, there would be plenty of fodder here for heartfelt retrospective specials on CNN or in the New York Times magazine about the impact of these historic riots — and yet no such coverage has been forthcoming. It’s quite a puzzle.

“You think you’re getting justice, but you’re just tearing up your own community,” a black woman in her 40s who runs a bakery in a predominantly black part of Milwaukee — in which significant, but conspicuously undercovered riots took place — told me. She added that she would be livid if she found out that her daughter in her early 20s ever participated in such activities, and was generally condemnatory of those responsible for causing the chaos. (Many people online have made it clear that they don’t believe me, but I swear I have not “cherry-picked” any of these interviewees.)

Of the dozens and dozens of randomly-selected black Americans that I have so far spoken to across the United States, only two expressed what one might call a “positive” view of the riots, and they were both young men. Everyone else I have encountered is unabashedly scornful of rioting, and many even express apprehensions about the basic logic of a movement referred to as “Black Lives Matter” which incongruously appears to them to have caused increased suffering in their predominantly black neighborhoods.

Here’s an interview I conducted on video with a black man, Tony in Milwaukee, who describes what it was like to escape from a riotous mob on his way home from work. “It’s crazy man. I really don’t understand it. Cuz they sayin’ Black Lives Matter and all this stuff,” he said. “But man, you’re hurting the black community.”

He, like many others in various places where riots occurred, also expressed confusion about why the wrongful police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis should have necessitated random destruction in their own city — hundreds of miles away — with its own set of localized concerns that don’t necessarily have anything in common with Minneapolis. Here’s a black resident articulating the same sentiment in Philadelphia, and another in The Bronx, both places which underwent major rioting.)

Seldom acknowledged is that a large segment of black residents in urban areas over a certain age — and particularly recent immigrants from the Caribbean and Africa — are more-or-less small “c” conservative in their social and political attitudes. In general, they are far more outwardly repulsed by riots that ravaged their neighborhoods than the activist media liberals and leftists who so eagerly imbued these riots with some kind of coherent, obviously virtuous political meaning — a meaning that was evidently not apparent to many of the people who actually live in the affected areas.

It should be noted that this “small c” conservative reaction by local minority populations doesn’t in any way mean that they would be motivated to support the Republican Party or Donald Trump — as Trump is also widely seen as an agent of chaos in his own right, who exacerbates Culture War animosities rather than alleviates them.

But their baseline aversion toward Trump doesn’t negate that their sentiments diverge extremely sharply from self-appointed left/liberal journalists and activists who often claim to speak on their behalf. (For example, they were almost uniformly supportive of the deployment of National Guard to quell the chaos — unlike journalists and activists, who tend to portray the deployment of military forces to urban areas as an unambiguous sign of fascist terror.)

In Chicago, as with many other cities, small businesses now display signs declaring themselves “Black-owned” or “minority owned” — partially as an expression of pride, but mostly to dissuade further rioting:

Residents of Chicago’s predominantly black South and West sides remarked that the looting appeared to begin at apparel stores like Foot Locker, and then branched out from there. Here’s how one man described the progression.

Opportunistic “looting” should generally be distinguished from the more ideologically-motivated “rioting,” as those who “looted” were generally locals (mostly but not exclusively blacks) who simply took advantage of an unprecedentedly chaotic situation to seize goods. Whereas “riots” motivated by consciously insurrectionist ideology — consisting of arson attacks and other actions intended to maximize chaos — appear to have been largely instigated by left-wing activist whites. You could possibly group both activities under the banner of “rioting,” but it’s worth drawing a distinction between these two different kinds of conduct which arise in a riot context.

Such was the enormity of the scale of the riots all manner of drastic local measures were enacted to preempt or curtail the chaos, many of which received next-to-no attention from national media on account of their preoccupation with other things. In Hammond, IN, which sits on the state border with Illinois, the Democratic mayor went so far as to order large concrete blocks erected in the middle of a public roadway to block off unwanted incoming rioter traffic.

During a recent stop there, I heard locals muse with half-formed rumors about business owners having taken matters into their own hands and heading to the rooftops of their buildings — with rifles in tow — to fend off potential looters. Often, such rumors cannot be verified, and the rumors themselves serve a kind of psychologically-gratifying purpose for those who spread them, as they allow bystanders to construct their own self-affirming narratives out of the chaos.

But everywhere I have gone over the past two months, if there was a hint of unwieldy protest or riot activity, places are awash with rumors. This, along with the pandemic, is clearly the preeminent political issue of Summer 2020 — as opposed to the presidential campaign, which is almost like an afterthought. Joe Biden? Meh. (Although this dynamic seems to be working pretty well for Biden.)

Maybe the media commentators who reflexively glamorized these riots don’t know or don’t care, but the primary victims — meaning those who feared for their safety, suffered severe material losses, and whose lives were upended — are themselves minorities, and were targeted by activist whites.

A deli operated by a Somali man in Minneapolis remained fully boarded up with bullet holes still visible in the partially shattered windows — caused by shots fired from an armed private security force that was summoned to protect businesses during the peak of the riots. (Residents recall with astonishment that Minneapolis Police were essentially nowhere to be found as the destruction unfolded.)

According to this man, who like many others did not want to be formally interviewed, the majority of those who wreaked havoc on his establishment were white. Note that scrawled onto the plywood boarding up the Somali man’s shop is the classic anarchist “A” symbol, popular among white left-wing activists.

Needless to say, with virtually his entire neighborhood boarded up, the street in tatters, and the front entrance to his deli shuttered — one has to go through a semi-hidden backdoor in order to gain entry — business is substantially down.

One of the Somali grocer’s neighbors is a Mexican convenience store owner. He said looters broke in and stole a significant amount of items. Here are the safety precautions he took:

Elsewhere in Minneapolis, a Lao-American community center, having already drastically reduced its operations due to COVID, is boarded up and closed off with yellow police tape:

Minneapolis/St. Paul has a large population of Hmong people. Several suffered inordinately due to the riots. In a recent Wall Street Journal column, I relayed my interactions with a man named Long Her, who’s operated a clothing store in St. Paul for nearly 30 years. In that time, he told me proudly, he never once had to call the police. That changed in late May after the George Floyd killing, when much of his prized inventory was ransacked. (Although the police have been no help.)

At the time we spoke, he didn’t know what insurance would cover. He was also advised by a repair company not to get his exterior door replaced yet, because there could be additional riots throughout the summer. Many small business owners in the area reported a major delay in their orders to get windows fixed, due to a massive backlog. (Mr. Her said his security footage revealed the intruders to be a white woman and a black man.) Here’s his tabulated losses, which he said are a low-ball estimate because they don’t include potential profits from the sale of various clothing items:

Across the street from that Lao community center is a pizza shop at which the majority of the workers are Hispanics. One worker said they’d been told by an ad-hoc activist group to proclaim themselves “black owned” (the owner is, in fact, black) so that people don’t get the wrong impression when they see mostly Hispanics working there.

The shell of what was once an auto repair shop operated by an Ethiopian immigrant still sits burned out and destroyed, leaving the man out of work potentially for months, he said. The man, who like many others did not want to conduct a formal interview, remarked that he now has nothing to do all day. His tools and equipment were also destroyed.

A small Mexican restaurant near the epicenter of the riots in Minneapolis had been forced to close for the first time in 25 years, a worker said — they hadn’t even closed for COVID. When I visited, they’d only recently re-opened — but business was steeply down, as far fewer potential customers are willing to enter the area, which is still strewn with rubble and debris.

The area surrounding the restaurant:

An open question is who initiated the arson attacks in Minneapolis. According to multiple accounts relayed to me, those who instigated these most extreme acts of destruction appeared to be white left-wing activists who were not from the area. This then consumed municipal resources and created a vacuum that enabled a portion of the local, largely black and minority populations to engage in opportunistic looting — hence the distinction I mentioned earlier.

Here’s an account from a young man, Matthew, who took part in the riot at the Third Police Precinct building, which was the Ground Zero for rioting in Minneapolis. Among other observations, he remarks that those who carried out the arson attacks were exclusively white — at least according to his own first-hand observations — and at certain points, says he witnessed non-white business owners warding off white rioters.

Here’s an anarchist “A” scrawled on the burned-out shell of a liquor store across the street from the Police Precinct building. (Taken from a video “tour” I conducted of the Lake Street area.)

The liquor store viewed from the front:

Flora Westbrooks, who I also interviewed for the Wall Street Journal, told me she was convinced that those who burned down the hair salon she’d operated since 1986 couldn’t possibly have been locals because of her reputation in the community.

The former site of Ms. Westbrooks’ salon, which was connected to an Arab-owned cafe.

This structure was formerly an Indian restaurant, among other things.

Does the ubiquity of these types of signs, in which owners declare their ethnic or racial status, seem healthy to you?

A low-income housing project that had been under construction, now effectively destroyed:

One of the early promoters of the former “Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone” (CHAZ) in Seattle had triumphantly used an image of the building set ablaze in the person’s Twitter bio:

(I would encourage you to view my full Twitter thread from Minneapolis if you haven’t seen it.)

One of the few booming industries in Minneapolis appears to be heavy-duty disaster-relief workers and construction contractors sifting through wreckage. (See my video tour of Lake Street area for footage of this.) While many of the establishments owned by large corporate chains have begun the recovery process, smaller establishments have not.

(In that video, a local resident, Rick, recalls being told during the riots that there would be no fire or police service available and people needed to fend for themselves. Because the winds were high on the night of the extreme arson attacks, flaming insulation was landing on residential houses, and so he had to fill up barrels of water just in case.)

The status of laundry services in North Minneapolis:

The George Floyd death site was blocked off to traffic and turned into a public memorial zone as of the time of my visit. Police generally do not enter this area, activists say, as it has been declared a “holy ground.” The day I visited, people had traveled there from as far as Florida and Texas.

Prayer circle that I took part in at the George Floyd death site:

Various places in St. Paul:

A school:

I’ll close with this. (Believe me, there’s plenty more. The amount of information and photos is overwhelming.) The owner of a convenience store in North Minneapolis told me he had to take up arms during the peak of the riots to protect his establishment. Here’s the exterior of the store:

The man, an immigrant from Sierra Leone, said the following: “I grew up in a war zone, and I’ve never seen anything like it.” What does it say that these kinds of experiences have barely impinged on the national consciousness?

Despite the incredible amount of destruction that I’ve personally witnessed, it’s only a tiny fraction. If I hadn’t made a point to spend six weeks traveling around the country, I never would’ve gotten this information.

Is a “national conversation” warranted here? I don’t know. That’s a ridiculous cliche, anyway. But I do know the enormity of what transpired over these past two months has not been adequately conveyed.

8 Democrat Myths Barr Debunked Between Deliberate Interruptions,"When Attorney General William Barr testified before the House Judiciary Committee last Tuesday, Democrats’ rhetorical questions reinforced eight falsehoods previously peddled by left-wing media. Notwithstanding these attempts to prevent Barr from setting the record straight, the attorney general dismantled much of the fake news that has made headlines over the last two months.

Here are the highlights of the media myths congressional Democrats paraded for the public during the hearing.

Myth 1: Barr overruled prosecutors’ sentencing recommendation for Roger Stone because of a Donald Trump tweet.

Several of Democrats’ attacks focused on President Trump associate Roger Stone. Democrat committee Chair Jerry Nadler accused Barr of personally interfering “with ongoing criminal investigations to protect the president and his allies from the consequences of their actions,” and then “when career investigators and prosecutors resisted these brazen unprecedented actions, you replaced them with less qualified staff who appear to be singularly beholden to you.” Rep. Hank Johnson, a Georgia Democrat, drilled more specifically into the Stone case, misrepresenting the facts in the process.

“Isn’t it true that when prosecutors in the Roger Stone case filed a memo with the court recommending a sentence of seven to nine years in prison, a few hours later, President Trump tweeted that the sentence recommendation was quote, ‘a disgrace,’” Johnson began. Barr acknowledged that reality. Johnson then asked Barr whether, “several hours after that, you filed a pleading with the court stating that the sentence recommendation would be changed and that you would be asking for a lighter sentence for Roger Stone?”

Barr attempted to explain that Johnson was mispresenting the circumstances, but the Democrat cut Barr short to grandstand. “You’re expecting the American people to believe that you did not do what Trump wanted you to do when you changed that sentencing recommendation and lowered it for Roger Stone?” Johnson asked rhetorically.

However, when Republicans allowed him to explain the circumstances of the about-face, the attorney general exposed the ridiculous nature of the charge that he was cutting breaks for Stone. “Stone was prosecuted under me, and I said all along, I thought that was a righteous prosecution,” the attorney general explained. But “line prosecutors were trying to advocate for a sentence that was more than twice anyone else in a similar position had ever served, and this is a 67-year-old man, first-time offender, no violence,” Barr continued. “I wasn’t going to advocate that because that is not the rule of law.”

The attorney general also testified that he “never discussed our sentencing recommendation with anyone outside the Department of Justice.” Barr then laid out the timeline: On Monday, Barr explained, he had concluded that the Department of Justice (DOJ) “should not affirmatively advocate for seven to nine years,” but would leave the decision to the sentencing judge. However, that night, the prosecutors filed a sentencing memorandum that did not reflect Barr’s decision.

“That night I told people we had to fix it first thing in the morning. We did as soon as I got in,” Barr said. Only then did Barr learn about the president’s tweet. Barr explained that he then “hesitated because I knew that I would be attacked for doing it. People would argue that I did it because of the tweet, but I felt at the end of the day, I really had to go forward with our filing because it was the right thing to do.”

Barr did do the right thing: In sentencing Stone, the presiding judge stated she was concerned seven to nine years would be greater than necessary,” and that she “agree[d] with the defense and with the government’s second memorandum.”

Myth 2: Barr dropped the case against Flynn because he was Trump’s friend.

Democrats likewise pushed the narrative that Barr filed a motion to dismiss the criminal charge against former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn because of Flynn’s connection to the president. Barr countered this charge both generally and specifically.

“I agree the president’s friends don’t deserve special breaks, but they also don’t deserve to be treated more harshly than other people, and sometimes that’s a difficult decision to make, especially when you’re going to be castigated for it,” Barr told the Judiciary Committee. “But that is what the rule of law is, and that’s what fairness to the individual ultimately comes to, being willing to do what’s fair to the individual.”

Barr then stressed what Democrats ignore—that it was an independent U.S. attorney in St. Louis “who had 10 years in the FBI and 10 years in the Department of Justice as a career prosecutor, who “determined, based on documents that had not been provided to Flynn’s side and not been provided to the court that in fact there was no basis to investigate Flynn.”

Rather, Missouri-based U.S. Attorney Jeff Jensen concluded “that the only purpose was to try to catch him in saying something that they could then say was a lie.” “Furthermore, it was clearly established by the documents that the FBI agents who interviewed him did not believe that he thought he was lying,” Barr added.

Knowing what we know now, Barr concluded, “We don’t think any of the U.S. attorneys in the department would have prosecuted this case.” And what “I’m trying to establish is that we will use the same standards for everybody before we indict anybody. This goes for both sides,” Barr stressed. He later added that “the true two standards of justice were really during the tail end of the Obama administration.”

Myth 3: Barr fired an acting U.S. attorney for investigating Trump associates.

Another line of attack focused on Barr’s firing of U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman. In June, Barr had decided to replace Berman as acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York until the permanent U.S. attorney could be confirmed. Barr had announced Berman would be “stepping down” because he intended Berman to remain in the DOJ. Yet after the announcement, Berman went public with a statement that he wasn’t going anywhere. Berman’s insubordination led to his immediate firing.

At the time, the media narrative ran that Barr had fired Berman because he was investigating Trump associates, and possibly even Trump. The House Judiciary Committee attempted to push that theory too, but Barr shot it down,” calling it “nonsense.” “Anyone familiar with the Department of Justice would say that removing a component head is not going to have any effect on any pending investigation,” Barr noted.

Myth 4: Barr punished Michael Cohen but rewarded Paul Manafort.

Democrats on the committee also attempted to paint the attorney general as showing favoritism to former Trump Campaign Manager Paul Manafort while retaliating against former Trump-attorney turned Trump critic Michael Cohen. Rep. Eric Swalwell took the lead in pushing the myth that Barr had retaliated against Cohen.

“Did you know that as a condition of Cohen’s release from prison, the government intended to direct Cohen not to engage with the media and not to write a book?” Swalwell asked Barr. Barr said “no,” then attempted to explain that situation.

Cohen had been furloughed from prison, Barr explained, and the conditions of that home confinement were set, not by the Bureau of Prisons but “by the probation office, which is part of the U.S. Court System.” “And it was the U.S. Court System that had the requirements about not writing,” Barr explained.

Swalwell ignored Barr’s response, claiming this condition of release was retaliatory, even though Barr’s office had nothing to do with the condition. Swalwell also attempted to paint Cohen’s return to prison as retaliatory, but again, Barr countered it was the probation office that had determined Cohen was being “uncooperative.” At that point, the Bureau of Prisons determined Cohen was no longer eligible for home confinement. Barr would also later testify he “didn’t even know [of] the decision to send Cohen back to prison.”

Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Texas) pivoted from Swalwell’s charge of retaliation against Cohen to an allegation that Barr favored Manafort by arranging his release from prison out of concern for the coronavirus.

“In March 26 and April 3rd, your department released guidelines, criteria, setting priorities by which people would be released early,” Garcia began. “By your own Department’s admission, Manafort did not meet that criteria. Since the start of this pandemic, we have repeatedly urged you to use your authority to protect vulnerable populations in prisons. Instead, you release the president’s former campaign manager.”

Barr had little chance to respond to the charge, with Garcia—like the rest of the Democrats on the committee—interrupting when he tried to correct the record. Yet, as she ended her tirade, Barr succinctly countered the claim: “The director of the BOP testified under oath: No one from Justice Department was involved” in the decision to release Manafort from prison.

Myths 5, 6: Barr used tear gas to clear out peaceful protestors for a photo op for Trump.

The myth that Trump and Barr are supposedly squashing peaceful protests throughout the country also held top billing at Tuesday’s hearing. One main line of this attack focused on the narrative that Barr had directed the removal of peaceful protestors, including with tear gas, from Lafayette Square in Washington, DC so Trump could walk to St. John’s Church for a photo op.

“On the first day of June, the world watched in horror on live television as federal agents deployed by the administration, and with you present and telling him to get it done, used force to clear Lafayette Park so that the president, with you and others at your side, could walk across the park and have a photo op in front of St. John’s church,” one committee member charged. Rep. Pramila Jayapal repeated this claim, saying Barr had directed “federal officers to close in on the protesters and to use shields offensively as weapons, tear gas, pepper balls, irritants, explosive devices, batons and horses to clear the area just so the president could get a photo op.”

‘There was unprecedented rioting right around the White House. Very violent.’

While Democrats refused to allow Barr to respond to the charges, Republicans provided the attorney general a chance to detail the facts. “There was unprecedented rioting right around the White House,” Barr explained. “Very violent.”

“During that time about 90 officers were injured. In fact, the Secret Service was so concerned it recommended the president go down to the shelter,” Barr noted. “There was a breach of the Treasury Department, the lodge—an historical building on Lafayette Park—was burned down, and St. John’s Church was set on fire,” Barr added.

On Monday, Barr explained, “there was total consensus that we couldn’t allow that to happen so close to the White House, that kind of rioting,” and “therefore we had to move the perimeter out one block and push it up toward I Street.” This plan had nothing to do with the president’s decision to walk to St. John’s Church, Barr explained.

Barr also responded to another falsehood, noting that no tear gas had been used in moving the perimeter. Rather, tear gas was used to clear the way for a fire truck to put out the fire at St. John’s Church the previous evening.

To say the protest was peaceful was also not accurate: “It is a fact that the park police reported, and I saw myself projectiles being thrown from that crowd,” Barr explained, “so I did not consider them at all peaceful protesters.”

Myth 7: Portland is just a bunch of peaceful protestors.

Next, the Democrats turned to Portland, chastising Barr for sending federal “troops” to the Oregon city, with Rep. Zoe Lofgren blaming the federal response for the violence. “The governor of Oregon and the mayor of Portland has asked that the federal troops leave because the reaction has actually been in reverse proportion, people are showing up because the troops are there,” Lofgren said, confusing federal law enforcement officials with the military.

She then proceeded to paint the protests as mostly “nonviolent,” with a “wall of moms” leading the way. Nadler pushed this narrative too, claiming “the protestors aren’t mobs, they are mothers, and veterans, and mayors.”

“I think your characterization of Portland is completely false,” Barr responded, and then laid out the facts—which are much different than the myth narrated by the Democrats on the committee. “In Portland, we have a relatively small number of federal officers who have been withstanding, [the assault] for almost two months. It’s a great strain, but we cannot just stand aside and allow the federal court to be destroyed.”

Where ‘we don’t have the support of the local government, we have to take a stand and defend this federal property.’

Where “we don’t have the support of the local government, we have to take a stand and defend this federal property,” Barr explained. Further, without the deployment of federal law enforcement, the federal building in Portland would likely not be standing today, Barr told Republican Jim Jordan, as “there’ve been multiple attempts to set it afire.”

The attorney general also squashed the idea that defending the federal courthouse in Portland infringed on protestors’ free speech rights. “I have to say,” Barr told the committee, “I don’t understand why a small contingent of marshals inside the court poses a threat to anybody’s First Amendment rights.”

Then he obliterated the idea that these are peaceful protestors: “They set up a fence on federal property,” and when people are arrested “it’s because they’re trying to come into the fence.” “These aren’t peaceful protesters,” Barr made clear. “They bring power tools to cut through the wire and so forth to get in.”

For two months, the federal courthouse has been under daily attacks, “where people march to the court, try to gain entrance and have set fires, thrown things, used explosives and injured police, including, just this past weekend, perhaps permanently blinding three federal officers for with lasers,” Barr countered.

Then, in what should have shamed the majority party, Barr laid out the shocking reality that makes him “concerned for the country”: “this is the first time in my memory that the leaders of one of our great two political parties, the Democratic Party, are not coming out and condemning mob violence and the attack on federal courts.” “Why can’t we just say the violence against federal courts has to stop? Could we hear something like that?” the attorney general asked the committee.

Myth 8: The DOJ is sending federal agents to cities to bolster Trump’s re-election bid.

But no, instead, at Tuesday’s hearing, Chair Jerrold Nadler took the peaceful-Portland-protestors myth national, claiming “the president wants footage for his campaign ads, and you appear to be serving it up to him as ordered.”

“There are those who believe you are sending federal law enforcement into these cities, not to combat violent crime, but to help with the president’s reelection efforts,” the committee chair claimed, adding “the president has made clear that he wants conflict between protesters and police to be essential claim at the central theme of his campaign.”

“We are on the defense, we’re not out looking for trouble,” Barr countered. He also refused let Nadler get away with the sleight-of-hand that sought to conflate protesters and rioters. “Protesters are good. Demonstrations are good. They’re part of the First Amendment. What I’m condemning is people who commit crime,” Barr told the committee. And federal law enforcement officials are not targeting protesters, but those engaged in violence, such as those attacking the Portland federal courthouse.

Democrat Rep. Jayapal attempted to reframe the attack by suggesting Barr responds differently when the protesters support the president. When Michigan protesters swarmed the Michigan capital, carrying guns, “some with swastikas,” Barr did nothing, Jayapal claimed.

Even with his limited ability to get a word in during his exchange with Jayapal, Barr nonetheless exposed the two fallacies in her argument: First, the Michigan capitol is not a federal building. Second, unlike in Portland, the local officials were able to handle the situation.

While Democrats on the committee hit Barr with a scattershot of other criticisms, none of those complaints hit their target either. Instead, Barr batted away falsehood after falsehood, and all within a fraction of the speaking time the Democrats controlled via their “reclaim their time” ploy.

CatholicVote Demands Joe Biden Condemn Democrat ‘Anti-Catholicism’,"Thursday, CatholicVote released a statement calling for presumptive Democratic Party presidential nominee, Joe Biden, to, “publicly condemn the disturbing attacks on Catholic saints, symbols, churches, statues, and beliefs.” The faith-based political advocacy organization chastised Biden, a baptized Catholic, and stated he has “a responsibility and duty to Catholics to publicly condemn these attacks.”

CatholicVote provided an extensive list of attacks on the Church describing the recent discrimination and violence as “commonplace” within the Democratic Party. Included within the statement was a description of “arson-related church fires, desecration of sacred symbols and statues by extremist mobs” as well as “hate-filled rhetoric of leading members of the Democratic party.” Socialist representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was specifically cited for her incendiary comments calling the statue of Fr. Damien of Molokai in the U.S. Capitol an example of “patriarchy and white supremacist culture.”

CatholicVote President, Brian Burch, charged the Democratic Party nominee and self-professed Catholic with having said nothing about leading members of the Democrat Party fueling “a climate of hate against Catholics” which has led to “acts of vandalism and violence.” “These attacks on the Church raise serious questions about the commitment of Joe Biden … to stand up to the rising climate of anti-Catholicism across the country,” said Burch.

Former Congressman and CatholicVote Senior Political Adviser, Tim Huelskamp, implored Biden to denounce the vandalism, if not for his faith then for the sake of history, saying, “Many of these statues and churches were built centuries ago by faithful Catholics and remain powerful symbols for Catholics today. All good and decent Catholics are offended by this growing anti-Catholic rampage.” Huelskamp added the attacks constituted a “shocking assault on our religious freedoms.”

On Wednesday, Catholic Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn) urged Attorney General William Barr “to protect religious freedom and combat religious discrimination in the United States.” Fleischmann cited“nearly a dozen” acts of vandalism against the Church, agreeing with CatholicVote that the attacks are a “disturbing trend.”

Fleischmann shared his letter on Twitter:

Today, I sent a letter to AG Barr urging the DOJ to protect religious freedom & combat religious discrimination in the U.S. My letter comes after numerous reports of vandalism at Catholic Churches across the nation, including an incident in Chattanooga.https://t.co/LFyLdEzFbi pic.twitter.com/YuIRBkBu2m — Chuck Fleischmann (@RepChuck) August 5, 2020

CatholicVote described an attack on Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Weymouth, MA where a Molotov cocktail was thrown at the church, marking “the sixth act of arson or vandalism against a Catholic church this year in Massachusetts alone.” CatholicVote pointed out that, “Among these attacks were the desecration of statues of the Blessed Virgin Mary outside of Boston.”

The organization cited a Wall Street Journal article reporting “over a dozen attacks on Catholic churches and statues” occurring over the span of a single week last month. Among those attacks. the Queen of Peace Church in Ocala, Florida, was set ablaze while parishioners were preparing for morning mass. Additionally, the Wall Street Journal reported “the roof and much of the interior of the 250-year-old Mission San Gabriel Arcángel in Los Angeles County was destroyed by fire,” and “in California, several statues of St. Junipero Serra, an 18th-century Spanish missionary, were violently pulled down by demonstrators.”

Last month, vandals “painted satanic symbols on the doors of St. Joseph’s Church in New Haven, CT.” Furthermore, CatholicVote included an expert a Diocese of New Haven statement that read, “The underlying motive of these sacrilegious attacks is clear: to intimidate and instill fear in the hearts of those who worship Christ.”

CatholicVote also addressed two instances where Democrats in Congress interrogated court nominees on the basis of their faith: “In November 2018, Senators Mazie Hirono and Kamala Harris submitted questions for the record interrogating Brian Buescher, a Catholic federal district court nominee from Nebraska, about his affiliation with the Knights of Columbus”; and, “In September 2017, California Senator Dianne Feinstein famously attacked judicial nominee Amy Coney Barrett saying, “the dogma lives loudly in you, and that’s a concern,” implying Barrett’s deeply held Catholic faith was incompatible with her ability to act impartially as a judge.”

"‘F— Pigs’: Rioters Attack Portland Police Station With Rocks, Set It On Fire","Demonstrations in Portland again descended into violence as hundreds attacked the city’s East Precinct police station by night. Fire, rocks, and rams were used by rioters in attempts to break into the occupied building, and a truck that appears to have been driven by a demonstrator tried to run over several officers when police arrived to break the siege, police say. A memorial to a fallen police officer was also defaced.

The events met mostly silence from corporate media.

The night began with hundreds marching towards the precinct late Wednesday night, police say. Eyewitnesses say the rioters used vehicles to block off roads around the station, then began vandalizing the building with anti-police slogans, including “F-ck pigs” and “FTP,” which stands for “F-ck the police.” Security cameras were quickly disabled. Videos of the opening have been released by Post Millennial journalist Andy Ngo, who has been covering Portland’s riots for weeks.

https://twitter.com/MrAndyNgo/status/1291313348630503425

For the first time since the riots began in Portland, antifa attacked the east precinct, located far on the east side of the city. Rioters immediately began disabling security cameras around the building. #PortlandRiots pic.twitter.com/s6hoPPwAs1 — Andy Ngô 🏳️‍🌈 (@MrAndyNgo) August 6, 2020

Later videos show officers were inside the building during the attack.

Once the cameras were disabled, videos show the rioters began tearing down protective barriers surrounding the building, then hammering against the exposed glass with rocks the size of shot putts, boards, and other unidentified tools. Lasers were used to blind officers inside, and a fire was set against the building’s protective entrance after rioters failed to gain entry through physical force.

https://twitter.com/MrAndyNgo/status/1291316396236963842

A riot was declared shortly after the attempts began.

Heavily geared police arrived to break up the attack, but met fierce resistance. Rioters lobbed “rocks the size of shot-puts,” commercial-grade fireworks, and other projectiles at the officers, whom the police say used tear gas and “crowd control munitions” in return. During the conflict, police say a truck associated with the demonstrators attempted to run over several of the officers.

Some of the rioters appeared to have been sporting Antifa symbols.

https://twitter.com/MrAndyNgo/status/1291366814002356225

Since federal agents largely left the city, rioters have moved to targeting police officers and police buildings. Another city building used by police was attacked on Monday, while the Portland Police Association headquarters was hit and set ablaze on Wednesday morning.

Corporate media has been largely silent on the continuing riots. For weeks, media and Democrat politicians have asserted that the violence was only caused by the presence of federal agents. Some went as far as to declare themselves vindicated and insist the movement was now peaceful — while police and federal buildings were attacked and set on fire.

The attacks come in the midst of a historic homicide surge in the city. According to the police association, there have been 366 shootings so far in Portland this year, which is already about the amount the city suffered in all of 2019.

https://www.facebook.com/PortlandPoliceAssociation/posts/3549031871787171

The association attributes the sudden spike to Mayor Ted Wheeler’s decision to “defund” the police. Spending on law enforcement was slashed, and the city’s gun violence reduction team was disbanded.

The Ghost Of Sarah Palin Will Haunt The Media This Election Cycle,"The week before I got married on my family’s homestead in Alaska, we found out Sarah Palin had been picked to be Sen. John McCain’s vice-presidential running mate.

This was big news for Alaska. Nearly everyone we knew was thrilled, even people who weren’t huge Palin fans. At the time, Palin was a popular governor who’d made a name for herself fighting a corrupt good ol’ boys system that had prevailed for too long in state politics. She was a Republican, but seen as a moderate who was willing to work with Democrats and take on powerful special interests, including the oil companies that held sway in the state capitol. People liked her, even if they didn’t always agree with her politics.

That included my family, which, like a lot of families in a place as small as Alaska, had a personal connection to Palin. My brothers and I had all worked for Wasilla’s parks and recreation department at some point during Palin’s time as mayor (after she was named McCain’s VP pick, we all joked that in high school we’d “worked for her,” which technically we had), and later she and her family had attended my parents’ church. The Sarah Palin we all knew was more or less an ordinary Alaskan—an ambitious and accomplished woman, certainly, but also someone we identified with, who understood Alaskans’ unique way of life, and who for the most part seemed to reflect our conservative values and our desire for pragmatic and effective governance.

That was not the Sarah Palin the rest of the country would come to know, not because she went through a radical transformation—although she did play up her folksiness for a national audience—but because the corporate media, who saw in her a threat to the election of Barack Obama, decided to tear her apart, to destroy her politically, even if that meant destroying her personally.

What ensued was the greatest persecution of an American political figure in modern times. Palin, a mother of five who had recently given birth to a baby boy prenatally diagnosed with Downs Syndrome, became an object of hate for the media. Nothing has come close in its ugliness, its mendacity, its complete lack of restraint and, given Palin’s status as the second woman ever to appear on a major-party presidential ticket, the abject hypocrisy of a media establishment that purports to champion women’s rights and equality.

Prepare for Transparently Insincere Sympathy for Palin

I say all this as a prelude to what we are about to witness. In the coming months, a phalanx of mainstream media outlets and leftist women’s groups will be deployed to defend Sen. Kamala Harris, Joe Biden’s vice-presidential pick, by labeling any and all criticism of her as sexist and possibly racist. (It remains unclear what we’re to make of Harris’s own charges against Biden of racism and sexism—and sexual assault—in the primaries earlier this year.)

Groups like Emily’s List, Planned Parenthood, NARAL, and others recently sent a letter to news outlets that they’ll be monitoring coverage of Biden’s VP pick by “popping up rapid response teams tasked with tracking and calling out sexism and racism in real-time,” according to NBC News. Meanwhile, Biden’s campaign manager recently warned on an all-staff call that “sexism will motivate the ugliest attacks against” the VP pick, and that everyone on the campaign will be enlisted to defend her, reports the Washington Post.

Even before Biden announced Harris as his running mate on Tuesday, we’re told, she had already faced sexist attacks that play on negative stereotypes, like being “maligned online for a past relationship.” The Post story also quotes one Democratic opposition researcher who says we should expect “a flood of content playing on common sexist tropes: portraying her as crazy, untrustworthy, unqualified, dumb, or sexual—claiming she is angry, or extreme, or perhaps that she ‘slept her way to the top.’”

We’re going to hear a lot of that sort thing this election cycle. Because the double standard that’s about to be applied to Harris is so appallingly obvious even to corporate media, we’re also going to hear a lot of retroactive and transparently insincere sympathy for Palin. Here’s one of the first out of the gate:

In the process of reporting on ego, ambition and Donald Trump, I came across an interesting nugget: a sense of sympathy from Democrats and Obama alumni over how Sarah Palin was treated. https://t.co/ZXggOsp8R3 — Sam Stein (@samstein) August 10, 2020

Among the Democratic operatives quoted in the piece is, no surprise, NARAL president Ilyse Hogue, who said, “[Palin] and Trump are cut from the same cloth. But because she was an ambitious woman, particularly upstaging a man held in high regard, people were hateful towards her in a way they would never be hateful towards any man.”

A touching sentiment, but this is the same Ilyse Hogue who, in August 2008, wrote to her colleagues at MoveOn.org about “McCain’s dangerous choice” and proceeded to repeat a litany of distortions and outright lies about Palin that became commonplace in the course of the campaign—that she was a biblical literalist who opposed teaching evolution in schools, that she was a Buchananite, that she didn’t think humans contributed to climate change, among many other things, none of which were true.

But lies and distortions of Palin’s views were mild compared to what came next. At the outset of his 2009 book, “The Persecution of Sarah Palin,” Matthew Continetti runs down a partial list of the kind of crude insults routinely hurled at Palin during and after the election cycle:

She has been called a ‘freak show,’ a ‘joke,’ an ‘extreme liability,’ a ‘turncoat b*tch,’ an ‘insult,’ a ‘fire-breather,’ ‘xenophobic,’ a ‘sitcom of a vice-presidential choice,’ a ‘disaster movie,’ a ‘shallow’ person, ‘chirpy,’ a ‘provincial,’ a ‘disgrace to women’ who was ‘as fake as they come,’ a ‘nauseating,’ ‘cocky wacko,’ a ‘jack in the box,’ ‘Napoleon in bunny boots,’ ‘extreme,’ ‘radical,’ a ‘vessel,’ a ‘farce,’ ‘Bush in drag,’ ‘not very bright,’ ‘utterly unqualified,’ a ‘bimbo,’ ‘Danielle Quayle,’ the ‘new spokesperson for bellicosity and confrontation,’ a ‘fatal cancer,’ ‘like a really bad Disney movie,’ ‘laughable,’ an ‘odd combination of Chauncey Gardiner from Being There and Marge from Fargo,’ ‘dangerous,’ a ‘bully,’ the ‘biggest demagogue in America,’ the ‘Paleolithic Princess of Parsimonious Patriotism,’ the ‘anti-Wonder Woman,’ ‘judgmental’… ‘dictatorial’ with a ‘superior religious self-righteousness,’ a ‘racist’ who was ‘absurd,’ ‘scary,’ and a ‘token,’ a ‘bantamweight cheerleader,’ an ‘airhead,’ an ‘idiot,’ a ‘librarian in a porn film,’ a ‘Jesus freak,’ a ‘man with a vagina’… a ‘Drama Queen,’ a ‘Republican blow-up doll’ who ‘ideologically’ is ‘their hardcore pornographic centerfold spread,’ an ‘opportunistic anti-female,’ a ‘true Stepford candidate, a cyborg,’ a ‘quitter,’ and—this list is by no means exhaustive—a ‘bonbon.’

Even these slurs—which today would get an editor or columnist summarily canceled if they were uttered about Biden’s VP nominee—pale in the face of what Andrew Sullivan cooked up in his fevered (to say the least) imagination.

Sullivan, with the blessing of his editors at The Atlantic, descended to depths rarely seen in American political journalism: he helped hatch and then relentlessly pursued a sleazy conspiracy theory that Palin’s infant son with Downs Syndrome, Trig, was not her own, that he was really her teenage daughter’s, that the public presentation of Trig as Palin’s son was an elaborate political ruse, and that Sullivan could prove it by analyzing photos of a pregnant Palin and applying his apparently newfound expertise in obstetrics.

I’m not kidding. You can read a complete rundown of all this by Christopher Badeaux from back in 2009, but suffice to say that Sullivan couched what amounted to a sordid obsession with Palin’s fertility as “just asking questions”—and by just asking questions, I mean he repeatedly demanded that Palin’s doctors release medical records proving she gave birth to her son Trig.

By Destroying Palin, Corporate Media Sowed the Wind

You would think there would be professional consequences for this kind of insanity, but you’d be wrong. Sullivan remains a respected elder statesmen of the internet, a popular columnist and speaker who until recently enjoyed a perch at New York Magazine.

Never mind that he kept grinding away at “Trig Trutherism” for years after the 2008 election. Never mind that he has never recanted his disgusting and sexist attacks on Palin and her family. Never mind that long after the election, columnists at outlets like The New Yorker were shrugging off Sullivan’s gross quackery and acting as if Sarah and Trig Palin were still fair game. Never mind that these unrelenting attacks didn’t just ruin Palin’s political career, they ruined her life.

For Sullivan and the rest of the media, destroying Palin—and in the process throwing out all pretensions they ever cared about sexism—was a small price to pay, not just to ensure Obama’s election but to ward off future Palins. They failed, not just in warding off future Palins but in erasing Palin herself.

On Tuesday, Palin posted a congratulatory note to Harris on Instagram with some friendly advice about the hazards of running as a female VP nominee. Given what she went through in ’08, Palin’s note is remarkable for how friendly, upbeat, and understated it is. That she, of all people, would strike such a tone on this subject is a testament to her strong character and goodwill, and yet another indictment of the ignoble media establishment that persecuted her.

Because here’s the thing. The media didn’t just hate Palin because she was a conservative Republican woman. They hated her because she was attractive, charismatic, and the mother of a young family. They hated her because she was not a hypocrite, especially about abortion. They hated her because a lot of ordinary Americans liked her, despite her rustic affectations and awkward public presence. They hated her for much the same reasons McCain staffers like Nicolle Wallace, who later shamefully turned on Palin for pats on the head from the media, hated her: she was totally indifferent to the approval of the East Coast establishment, and she wasn’t afraid to laugh in its face and call out its vapidity and duplicity.

They could not know it at the time, but by destroying Palin they were sowing the wind. Many of the things the media hated about Palin they ended up getting tenfold in Donald Trump eight years later. In 2016, accusations of sexism against Trump fell flat, not just because Trump could point to the hypocrisy of Bill and Hillary Clinton on the subject, but because the Palin saga proved, to at least half the country, that Democrats and the media don’t care about sexism, even sexism of the worst kind, as long as it’s deployed in the service of their political agenda.

Now they come forward under the guise of calling out sexism in politics with a thinly-veiled attempt to preempt all legitimate criticism of Harris. It won’t work. Republicans and conservative media are not likely to treat Harris the way Palin was treated, but when Democrats and the media inevitably cry out that Trump is being sexist, that conservatives are being unfair, and that in retrospect they regret how they treated Palin, no one will be able to hear them above the whirlwind.

"Amid Riots Ripping The U.S., NPR Promotes Book 'In Defense Of Looting'","Vicky Osterweil’s new book, “In Defense of Looting,” “makes the case that looting isn’t a betrayal of protests for Black lives, but a vital aspect of the movement,” writes Claire Fallon in the Huffington Post. Fallon approvingly connected Osterweil’s defense of looting directly to rioting in Wisconsin last week that led to two dead and millions of dollars in damages against innocent bystanders who saw their life’s work go up in smoke.

National Public Radio also decided to feature Osterweil Thursday on its podcast “Code Switch,” for which the tag line is “Race. In your face,” under the banner “America reckons with racial injustice.” The interview openly makes the case that the existence of racial injustice in history justifies violent crime.

NPR assistant editor Natalie Escobar, a graduate of the nation’s top-rated journalism school at Northwestern University and who previously worked at The Atlantic, uses her publicly funded job and platform to interview Osterweil about his new book. It is expanded from a 2014 essay with the same name issued in the wake of the Michael Brown riots in Ferguson, Mo., which also included looting.

Osterweil is a transgender male who calls himself a “writer, editor, and agitator.” His Twitter handle is Vicky_ACAB. ACAB means “all cops are b-stards.” The acronym has been spray-painted on buildings in Kenosha and numerous other riot-torn American cities this summer in the name of Black Lives Matter. Osterweil has written for The Nation, an openly Jacobin publication, and Al Jazeera America, according to his Barnes and Noble bio.

“In the past months of demonstrations for Black lives, there has been a lot of hand-wringing about looting,” Escobar opens the introduction to their interview. Since the looting-accompanied rioting has ruined myriad innocent, largely working-class and minority Americans‘ businesses and lives, yes, I’d say there has been “a lot of hand-wringing about looting.”

Escobar wants to turn that into hand-waving. Osterweil “argues that looting is a powerful tool to bring about real, lasting change in society,” Escobar writes. “The rioters who smash windows and take items from stores, she says, are engaging in a powerful tactic that questions the justice of ‘law and order,’ and the distribution of property and wealth in an unequal society.”

Looting is wealth redistribution. Good to know.

Another thing Osterweil says is that Democrat public officials’ and the media’s constant attempts this summer to distinguish the rioters from “peaceful protesters” is a lie and a ruse: “Another trope that’s very common is that looters and rioters are not part of the protest, and they’re not part of the movement. That has to do with the history of protesters trying to appear respectable and politically legible as a movement, and not wanting to be too frightening or threatening….the history of the movement for liberation in America is full of looters and rioters. They’ve always been a part of our movement.”

Osterweil clarifies early in his NPR interview that he is indeed openly supporting theft in the name of justice: “When I use the word looting, I mean the mass expropriation of property, mass shoplifting during a moment of upheaval or riot. That’s the thing I’m defending. I’m not defending any situation in which property is stolen by force. ”

Stealing is force, bucko. Taking away someone’s property is taking away his life. That’s because, for non-criminals, money comes from work. Work requires time. Time is a limited and precious commodity. Non-criminals use large parts of our lives to work to generate the income that we use to buy things. Therefore, property represents a portion of our lives. Taking someone’s property therefore equals taking part of his life away. (This is also why high taxes are immoral.)

This is a publicly funded “news” organization using U.S. tax dollars to glamorize and rationalize theft and property damage. While that may be surprising, considering that professors and teachers at tax-funded institutions use their comfortable public sinecures to also encourage looting and rioting, maybe it shouldn’t be. Just like they haven’t done anything to keep public funds from people who teach Americans to hate America, however, don’t look to Republicans to defund NPR any time soon.

Osterweil says many other eyebrow-raising things, including in this section of the NPR interview:

[Looting] does a number of important things. It gets people what they need for free immediately, which means that they are capable of living and reproducing their lives without having to rely on jobs or a wage… It also attacks the very way in which food and things are distributed. It attacks the idea of property, and it attacks the idea that in order for someone to have a roof over their head or have a meal ticket, they have to work for a boss, in order to buy things that people just like them somewhere else in the world had to make under the same conditions. It points to the way in which that’s unjust… Importantly, I think especially when it’s in the context of a Black uprising like the one we’re living through now, it also attacks the history of whiteness and white supremacy. The very basis of property in the U.S. is derived through whiteness and through Black oppression, through the history of slavery and settler domination of the country. Looting strikes at the heart of property, of whiteness and of the police. It gets to the very root of the way those three things are interconnected. And also it provides people with an imaginative sense of freedom and pleasure and helps them imagine a world that could be…riots and looting are experienced as sort of joyous and liberatory.

Osterweil’s essay “In Defense of Looting” was also promoted this summer in GQ magazine’s “Reading List for Radicalizing Your Parents.” The GQ article summarizes the essay: “In challenging the widely accepted notion that the civil rights movement was non-violent, and that its non-violence predicated its limited successes, Vicky Osterweil flatly lays out the practical, tactical, and political benefits of rioting and looting.” Note how here GQ legitimizes violence in the name of “civil rights.”

To the left, using the wrong pronoun for a transgender person is violence, but violently stealing your stuff is civil rights. As Federalist Senior Contributor Ellie Bufkin said to me, “The left has destroyed language so fully that a white man who claims to be a woman has written that black people stealing things is freedom.”

“One thing about looting is it freaks people out. But in terms of potential crimes that people can commit against the state, it’s basically nonviolent. You’re mass shoplifting. Most stores are insured; it’s just hurting insurance companies on some level. It’s just money. It’s just property. It’s not actually hurting any people,” Osterweil told NPR. In his 2014 essay, he said looting has been “one of the most righteous anti-white supremacist tactics available” in America.

Tell that to this couple.

I spoke with Scott and his mother Linda. Their furniture store was set on fire last night during the Kenosha riots. Linda cried at the sight of the wreckage.

In his NPR interview, Osterweil defended looting from small business owners as well as big-box stores: “When it comes to small business, family-owned business or locally owned business, they are no more likely to provide worker protections. They are no more likely to have to provide good stuff for the community than big businesses.” Tell that to these people.

In his Huffington Post interview with an obviously smitten white iGen female, Osterweil says “the savage has no concept of property; they don’t actually have any real ownership to the land.” True. To him, however, being “savage” is a good thing. It is a goal.

He also very openly explains why Black Lives Matter protesters are going after police: It’s because they are only superficially interested in what is alleged to be police brutality. More deeply, they attack the police because the police are an emblem of and the front-line guarantors of law and order. The police’s job is to secure people’s lives and property. Socialists want both of those to be under their control, not left to individuals to manage independently.

As Georgi Boorman explains, the left’s talk about white privilege and “antiracism” is not really about race. It’s about redistribution of wealth and power. It’s ultimately about socialism. The rioters and looters believe they are entitled to other people’s things. They are simply the rough, street version of the current Democrat Party.

“People don’t talk about this movement being an attack on private property,” Osterweil told HuffPo. But it is: “And that’s because if we attack whiteness, private property, and the police all at once, you’re talking about a revolution.”",https://thefederalist.com/2020/08/31/amid-riots-ripping-the-country-npr-promotes-book-in-defense-of-looting/,2020-08-31
‘How Could We Get This Wrong?’: Texts And Emails In Palin Defamation Lawsuit Show NYT Editorial Negligence,"In 2017, the New York Times ran an editorial claiming that former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin was connected to, and even incited the 2011 shooting that killed six people and wounded Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Palin is now suing the paper of record for defamation, and discovery documents obtained by The Columbia Journalism Review (CJR) reveal how chaos and editorial negligence played out in the Times’s newsroom.

The editorial titled, “America’s Lethal Politics,” first penned by Elizabeth Willaimson on the congressional baseball practice shooting in Arlington, Virginia, was reportedly submitted right before 5 p.m. but required extra editing from The Times’s editorial page editor James Bennet.

The piece referenced the 2011 shooting, citing a map posted on Palin’s PAC Facebook page, which documented districts where “House members who voted for Obamacare” but were won by the McCain and Palin presidential ticket in 2008. “The link to political incitement was clear,” read the Times editorial, despite the fact that there is no evidence that the shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, ever even knew about the map. Even the Washington Post called the claim “bogus.”

Discovery documents from Palin’s lawsuit, including “depositions, statements, story drafts, emails and texts,” show that The Times knew about the error not long after it was published, and failed to issue a correction until the next morning. Even then, Palin’s name was still mentioned in the piece.

“It was very much a first draft and … it wasn’t exactly accomplishing the objectives that we had set out that morning to achieve. [It] read to me much more like a summary of the news,” Bennet said. “I was concerned about the deadlines approaching. We just didn’t have that much time, and I wound up plunging in and just beginning to effectively rewrite the piece.”

While Williamson wrote a paragraph about the 2011 shooting and mentioned Sarah Palin’s PAC map with a target placed on Gifford’s district, it was Bennet who took her implications further with his edits.

Williamson originally wrote:

Just as in 2011, when Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a nine-year-old girl, Mr. Hodgkinson’s rage was nurtured in a vile political climate. Then, it was the pro-gun right being criticized: in the weeks before the shooting Sarah Palin’s political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized crosshairs.

Bennet changed to:

Was this attack evidence of how vicious American politics has become? Probably. In 2011, when Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a nine-year-old girl, the link to political incitement was clear. Before the shooting, Sarah Palin’s political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs. Conservatives and right-wing media were quick on Wednesday to demand forceful condemnation of hate speech and crimes by anti-Trump liberals. They’re right. Though there’s no sign of incitement as direct as in the Giffords attack, liberals should of course hold themselves to the same standard of decency that they ask of the right.

Bennet’s use of the word “incitement,” according to CJR, was questioned by a federal judge but met with the excuse that Bennet “ was not reporting the editorial…. I was editing it, and so I was working from the draft that was in front of me on a tight deadline.”

According to emails published by CJR, other editors looked over the piece, but the mistake was not mentioned until after the story was posted and “Twitter exploded.”

When staff editorial writer Ross Douthat reached out to Bennet after the story was posted that night criticizing the decision to run the editorial with false and horrific accusations against Palin, Bennet brushed it off saying that he would “look into this tomorrow.”

Other editors began to question Bennet about the article so he reached out to Williamson to question that part of the piece.

“Are you up? The right is coming after us over the Giffords comparison. Do we have it right?” he messaged.

The next morning, Bennet emailed other staff members saying that he didn’t know the facts and that he was “very sorry for my own failure.”

Hey guys — We’re taking a lot of criticism for saying that the attack on Giffords was in any way connected to incitement.… I don’t know what the truth is here, but we may have relied too heavily on our early editorials and other early coverage of that attack. If so, I’m very sorry for my own failure on this yesterday. … I’d like to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible this morning and correct the piece if needed.

According to court documents, Linda Cohn, an editor under Bennet, said “There was a general gasp in the room like, ‘Oh, my God. How could we get this wrong?’”

The Times issued a correction to the story, removing certain lines “linking political incitement to Palin,” but did not remove her name or the original implication by Williamson from the piece.

“We did not apologize to her.” Bennet said.

We're sorry about this and we appreciate that our readers called us on the mistake. We've corrected the editorial. https://t.co/t1FZ3iEYQJ pic.twitter.com/k7WW5uJIQO — New York Times Opinion (@nytopinion) June 15, 2017

Here's the before and after of the two paragraphs from the @nytimes editorial pic.twitter.com/n8GJvHSl2C — Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) June 15, 2017

Former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin filed a lawsuit against The Times for the mistake just a few weeks after it happened, alleging that the implication that she incited or was even linked to the Arizona shooting was defamation.

Federal District Court Judge Jed S. Rakoff in Manhattan previously dismissed the case claiming that “negligence this may be; defamation of a public figure it plainly is not.” A panel in 2019, however, overruled Judge Rakoff’s decision and allowed the case to proceed.

While the New York Times labeled the published misinformation as “an honest mistake” and are reportedly “confident we will prevail before a jury,” Palin must prove that “‘actual malice’ or ‘reckless disregard’ for the truth,” was demonstrated by The Times.

The lawsuit, which has lasted for almost four years, will go to trial in early 2021.

Bennet was not fired over the incident but did leave his position in June of this year after running an op-ed from Sen. Tom Cotton calling for “federal troops to restore law and order” in areas plagued with rioting and looting following the death of George Floyd.

"FLASHBACK: BLM Was Violent From The Start, And Media Knew It","Two officers were shot at close range while they sat in their cruiser Saturday night in Los Angeles. The victims, who were hit multiple times and in critical condition Sunday (but are now are expected to survive) are a 24-year-old man and a 31-year-old woman, whose six-year-old child stayed home while her husband came to her side in the hospital.

Outside, Black Lives Matter protesters blocked the emergency entrance to St. Francis Hospital, chanting “We hope they die” and “Y’all gonna die one by one.”

Update: The gunman walked up on the deputies and opened fire without warning or provocation. pic.twitter.com/cBQjyKkoxJ

https://twitter.com/selfdeclaredref/status/1305047189572513792

It was a murderous terrorist attack, within hours claimed, if not perpetrated, by Black Lives Matter. The shooter is still at large.

These two officers graduated the academy 14 months ago, before Democrat and other leftist politicians once again abandoned them to the mob. Since George Floyd died under arrest, these politicians have chanted Black Lives Matter’s anti-police lies alongside the crowds.

It wasn’t surprising it came to this. For more than half a decade, Black Lives Matter has used a nice-sounding name to shroud a terrorist agenda. “Now,” I wrote July 8, “through a combination of political foolishness, public amnesia, and willful media gas-lighting, America gets to live it all again — and more civilians and police officers are being attacked and even killed.”

And in the months since, we’ve seen roads and bridges blocked, young and old attacked, and a civilian murdered — all in its name.

In a sane world, Black Lives Matter blocking entrance of a hospital to cheer for the death of a 31 year old mother of a 6 year old boy would be the end of a movement. pic.twitter.com/V4bOV3LJ0K

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, in the meantime, condemned the shooting Sunday, but still refused to name the organization behind the violence on our streets. And why would he? On Wednesday, he attacked the president for even criticizing them. Campaign staffers donated money to bail out rioters in Minneapolis, then bragged about it online. His running mate tweeted a link so her supporters could follow suit. The Democratic Party thinks they’re on its side.

July 8, The Federalist — The Black Lives Matter protests are radical, they are violent, and they have claimed innocent lives all over the country. This isn’t a surprise: We’ve watched this movement played out before by many of the exact same leaders and even under the exact same name. Now, through a combination of political foolishness, public amnesia, and willful media gas-lighting, America gets to live it all again — and more civilians and police officers are being attacked and even killed.

The Black Lives Matter movement isn’t new at all. It’s the same loose collection of good-thinking people concerned over police violence and violent, anti-police and anti-family radicals as it was when it first gained national prominence in 2014.

As a refresher, the group was founded in 2013, during President Barack Obama’s second term and after the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin in Florida. It wasn’t until a rash of viral police-related deaths the next year that its national profile began to rise, including protests over the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Eric Garner in New York City, and then the following year Freddie Gray in Baltimore and Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina.

It was cheered on at the time by the media for all the same reasons it’s being cheered on today: Some of the viral videos and events convincingly depicted unjustified killings of black suspects by police, and despite the clear and radical politics of the founders, their name conveys an obvious truism. Unfortunately, it quickly showed its violent and intolerant side then, just as it has today.

Americans likely most clearly recall Ferguson’s protests, where for days black-owned businesses were torched and looted. Over the next few years, we watched in horror as Baltimore’s years-long revival was stopped in its tracks, block after block burned, and families attending an afternoon baseball game were set upon by screaming mobs.

As editor in chief of The Daily Caller News Foundation then, I oversaw our broader Baltimore 2015 riot coverage. As two in the morning approached on April 28, I turned off the police scanner, confident our guys were OK and looking forward to a few hours’ sleep before an early workday. Minutes later, our man running the coverage on the ground texted, “We are alright,” which indicated to me that they were not alright at all. Indeed, my friend was in the emergency room with two of our young reporters, who had been beaten and robbed by the rioters.

“When I saw the guy heading our way with a hammer in his hand and a bandanna covering his face, I knew he meant business,” a New York Daily News reporter who ran to their aid and then drove our guys through the mob to safety wrote later that morning. By the time they escaped, Caller reporter Casey Harper was struggling to stay conscious with a severe concussion, broken eye socket, and stolen phone, while his colleague Connor Wolf got off with a broken nose (and managed to hold onto his blood-stained notebook throughout). The two had been targeted for being white. No one slept until after we were back in the newsroom and their story was filed.

The violence and disruption they’d been subject to were tolerated and papered over by Democrats and corporate media, who made excuses for attacks on civilians, police, and media, and blamed outside agitators even while they were shouted down and disrupted by activists demanding “a conversation” but committed to ensuring no one speaks but them.

The following year, 2016, national Black Lives Matter protests broke out against the killing of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Dozens of officers were injured with projectiles and threatened by protesters. Then on July 7, just before 9 p.m. CT, a man opened fire on police preparing for one of the protests in Dallas, killing three policemen, wounding three others, and wounding one civilian.

During his retreat, he killed another officer, shooting him in the back after sneaking around a pillar he was taking cover behind during a gunfight. Seeking to fortify an El Centro College building, he opened fire on two campus cops, hitting one in the gut and injuring the other with shattered glass.

Police followed the man’s trail of blood through the school, engaging when they could clearly make him out in the darkness. From a window near where he made his last stand, he was able to kill another police officer who was on the street below. After negotiations broke down, the department killed him with a remote bomb.

Before he was killed, the gunman told a negotiator he was motivated by anger on behalf of the Black Lives Matter movement. His Facebook page called for people to “KILL EVERYTHING IN BLUE EXCEPT THE MAIL MAN.” By the morning of July 8, the murdered men included Officers Lorne Ahrens, Michael Krol, former Army Ranger Michael Smith, former U.S. Navy sailor Patrick Zamarripa, and former Marine Brent Thompson.

“Protests are messy,” a Vox writer wrote dismissively a week later. “When thousands or millions of people rise up in very passionate demonstrations, some bad, violent people are going to get caught up in the cause.”

But the pressure was intense, and reluctant cracks began to form in the ranks. “Black Lives Matter Was Gaining Ground,” a New York Times headline lamented, “Then a Sniper Opened Fire.”

Things quieted down. Donald Trump won the presidency, and shell-shocked journalists and Democrats went on a short-lived soul-searching mission, wondering what went wrong and how they could have misread the American public so badly. “Maybe we pushed too far,” President Obama privately reflected. “What if we were wrong?”

The introspection did not last, and by the end of the year — a year five police officers were killed and dozens wounded and hospitalized by Black Lives Matter radicals — BuzzFeed fondly looked back on 2016 as “the year Black Lives Matter went global.”

Just a few short weeks into the summer of 2020, it’s happening again: Seven shot in a Louisville protest park; one week later a protester killed; two dead in Chicago; four shootings in Seattle’s “autonomous zone;” a 77-year-old, black, retired St. Louis Police captain murdered; a 22-year-old, black woman in Davenport shot as she tried to leave.

Once again, politicians and media are defending and gaslighting for the violence. “I want to be clear how I characterize this,” MSNBC’s Ali Veshi said while buildings visibly burned in the night sky behind him. “This is mostly a protest. It is not, generally speaking, unruly.”

“But fires,” he admitted, back-lit by flames, “have been started.”

Meanwhile in Washington, D.C., rioters threw frozen bottles, glass, rocks, and bricks at police, then lit a church on fire. Afterward, corporate reporters, Democratic politicians, and even the leader of that church called the protests peaceful and attacked police tactics. The mayor allowed protesters to maintain that space, rename it Black Lives Plaza, and paint “Black Lives Matter” on the street.

“White women are lucky that we are just calling them ‘Karen’s,'” Washington Post editor Karen Attiah wrote June 29, “And not calling for revenge.” She listed her reasons for revenge on white women as the deadly racist massacre in Tulsa 99 years ago, the lynching of Emmet Till 70 years ago, liberal feminists making her feel excluded, and white women voting for Donald Trump.

Eight days later, she complained that “The ideas of the elite class is to be protected [sic] and supported at all costs,” but “black people… poor people… [and] uneducated people? We’re supposed to accept our marginalization.” She graduated from Northwestern University, won a Fulbright Scholarship, got a master’s at Columbia University, is now the global opinions editor for The Washington Post, and still has not been fired.

But the charade cannot stand. This past weekend, an eight-year-old black child was shot and killed besides her frightened mother as the driver tried to navigate around illegal barriers Black Lives Matter protesters were guarding near the Atlanta Wendy’s where a black man was killed after scuffling with police and stealing and firing one officer’s Taser. The little girl’s name was Secoriea Turner.

“They say ‘black lives matter,'” her father, hoarse with pain, accused the movement just hours later. “You killed your own. You killed your own this time.”

“You killed a child. She didn’t do nothing to nobody.”

“My baby,” her mother sobbed as family comforted her and helped her walk from the stage.

“At the point that an eight-year-old baby is killed, the discussions have ended,” the mayor announced. Just hours later, another person was killed and two more wounded nearby.

But some aren’t getting the message. “If you want an all-black lives matter movement started … then start that movement,” CNN’s Don Lemon told black actor Terry Crews Monday. “But that’s not what Black Lives Matter is about.”

Lemon was wrong on most things during that segment, but on that one point, he was right. Let’s see how long it takes us to remember.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/14/flashback-black-lives-matter-was-violent-from-the-start-and-media-and-politicians-knew-it/,2020-09-14
Another Man Allegedly Ambushes Police Officer In 'Unprovoked Attack',"A sheriff’s deputy in Oildale, Califonia is on administrative leave after he shot a man who attacked him on Tuesday while he responded alone to reports of a suspicious vehicle with two people inside.

“The deputy arrived and located the vehicle, which was a reported stolen vehicle,” said Public Information Officer for Kern County Sheriff’s Office Joel Swanson to local news media. “As he was dealing with that vehicle, a subject ran up behind him in an apparent ambush attack. And a struggle ensued with the deputy and that subject.”

It was during the struggle that the deputy fired three shots at Ricardo Enrique Usher, the suspect. Usher was transported to the hospital and is now “facing felony assault charges and a misdemeanor for resisting arrest.” His bail is set at $500,000.

According to The Kern County Sheriff’s Office, the suspected ambush was an “unprovoked attack.”

“At this point it appears that this was an unprovoked attack and the deputy had no knowledge of the suspect being in the area until the suspect was nearly on top of the deputy,” Swanson said.

The suspected ambush comes a few days after two Los Angeles County deputies were also ambushed by an armed suspect while sitting in their patrol vehicle in Compton, a Los Angeles sector. Both were transported to St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood, California, with serious injuries. Outside the hospital as the badly wounded officers were being given emergency care, protestors called the cops “pigs,” screamed “f-ck the police,” and said “we hope they die.”

Two of the people at the protest, including an NPR reporter, were arrested and charged with violating California penal code 148, which prohibits anyone from stopping a “public officer, peace officer, or an emergency medical technician” from performing his assigned duties.

A $675,000 reward is available for anyone with “information leading to the arrest and conviction of the gunman,” but no suspect was named as of Thursday.

"Bishop Knelt To BLM, Then Vandal Hacked Up Jesus Statue In His Church","In a perverse irony, a statue of our Lord was decapitated last week at St. Patrick Cathedral in El Paso, Texas, the diocese whose bishop made headlines in June for a photo op kneeling with a Black Lives Matter sign. Bishop Mark J. Seitz’s public support for a Marxist organization that has fueled a summer of terror, violence, and destruction is shameful. He may have been rewarded by an enthusiastic call from Pope Francis, but the alliance the bishop forged was an unholy one, and he is now witnessing the fruits of that perverse union.

It is the same bitter lesson that feckless mayors such as Ted Wheeler of Portland must learn: Contrived obsequiousness and self-flagellation don’t heal racial and social tensions and won’t appease the mob. That capitulation simply spurs and emboldens lawless degenerates to the point they descend upon your home.

In Seitz’s case, the retribution is infinitely graver, a vile assault on our Lord himself. Seitz shouldn’t be “saddened,” he should be horrified. The desecration of a statue of Jesus should not be regarded as merely an act of “vandalism,” as the diocese of El Paso lamely described it, but as a gross sacrilege against the second person of the Trinity.

Seitz’s misstep should serve as a sober warning to other church leaders who have either paid lip service to the BLM organization and its radical left doctrine, or who have been too cowardly to sound the alarm. If the clergy tacitly condones or, as with Seitz, even applauds a group whose beliefs, agenda, and tactics directly oppose the church, they should be prepared for these despicable acts of anti-Christian desecration to escalate.

This Destruction Is Unsurprising

The rector of St. Patrick Cathedral, Fr. Trini Fuentes, described himself as shocked by “such an unexpected situation.” For anyone with the slightest awareness of what has been unfolding in this country over the past few months, yet another attack on a statue of Jesus is not only to be anticipated, it is completely consistent with the BLM organization’s divisive and destructive narrative, and the anti-Christian hate crimes that have ensued.

Disturbing attacks on the Christian faith have been spreading with alarming frequency around the country. Over the summer, the historic San Gabriel Mission in California and the Queen of Peace Catholic Church in Ocala, Florida, were set on fire. Statues of Jesus and Mary at churches in Boston, Mass., Miami, Tenn., and Colorado Springs, Colo. were set alight, beheaded, and defaced. On Sept. 11, someone captured a video in broad daylight of the toppling of a statue of Our Lady of Guadeloupe outside a church in the Diocese of Brooklyn.

So no, the latest attack in El Paso was not “unexpected.” According to a court affidavit, the individual charged with the destruction of the statue told police “the skin color of the statue was the wrong color.” The suspect’s statement echoes the words of the radical-left BLM activist Shaun King, who tweeted that images of white Jesus are a tool of “white supremacy” and “oppression” and should be torn down.

Anti-Religious Attacks Are Nothing New

Sacrilegious attacks on Christian symbols are not about protesting racial inequality and improving the lives of black Americans. They are part of a Marxist insurrection designed to intimidate, terrorize, and destroy. That any bishop would respond to this scourge with anything other than unqualified condemnation is doctrinally perverse. It’s an abrogation of his apostolic duty to instruct and lead the lay faithful.

In his encyclical on socialism 150 years ago, Pope Leo XIII urged bishops to endeavor that “the children of the Catholic Church neither join nor favor in any way” what he described as “abominable sects.” Leo XIII, and before him Pope Pius IX, explained that the specific names of these groups and movements vary, but they are always “bound together by the closest ties in a wicked confederacy.” Their objective is always the rejection of the divine and the subversion of all civil society.

BLM is a 21st-century version of the type of socialist group these popes warned about. No bona fide Catholic shepherd should be advocating an organization that opposes fundamental church teaching on family, the sanctity of life, the dignity of the individual, original sin, and redemption.

Nor should he cheerlead a movement that has led to the killing of innocent people, the shooting and ambushing of police, the destruction of property, the targeting of ordinary Americans, and the desecration of churches and religious symbols. With its exploitation of class differences and racial inequality and its embrace of violent uprisings as a means of overthrowing public order, it is clear that this is not a group to which the church should be kneeling.

The Church Must Stand Against BLM

Even church leaders who have not gone as far as taking a knee to BLM, have been reluctant to condemn the organization. When Archbishop Wilton Gregory of Washington, D.C., spoke at an online conference entitled “Race in America: The Faith Perspective,” he suggested the social unrest and protests the country has witnessed have been a “wonderful assembly of Americans” and a display of unity.

Bishop Timothy Doherty of the Diocese of Lafayette-in-Indiana suspended one of his priests for strongly criticizing the BLM organization. Even Bishop Robert Barron, who has been vocal in condemning the cancel culture’s targeting of Catholic saints, has been conspicuously quiet on BLM’s Marxist agenda.

When asked about the organization during an interview for the podcast “Jesuitical,” Barron missed a crucial opportunity to educate listeners about why BLM goes against fundamental church teaching. Instead, he focused on tenuous points of commonality, such as injustice and feelings of righteous indignation.

Bishop Thomas Daly of Spokane, Wash., is one of the few bishops who have bravely responded with a resounding “No” to the toxic rhetoric of the BLM organization. In a recent interview, Daly correctly argued that we can and should stand for black lives without supporting BLM. The interview was a response to a ludicrous video released by Catholic Charities Eastern Washington. In it, CEO Dr. Rob McCann claimed the Catholic Church is racist, all white people are inherently racist, and BLM is a “Christ-like movement.”

No amount of nauseating wokespeak can explain how a supposedly “Christ-like movement” has spawned a toxic climate in which radicalized individuals are desecrating images of Christ. Enough is enough. Bishops must take a stand, not a knee, and unanimously condemn the attacks against Christianity, and the Marxist, anti-Catholic vitriol that the Black Lives Matter organization has been relying on to foment this seething hatred.

Inside Democrats’ Playbook To Destroy Republican Judicial Nominees,"The initial battle plan by establishment leftists to attack the faith, family, and character of Supreme Court nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett is neither surprising nor new. As a counsel on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee for more than five years, I gained a clear inside look at the tactics used by Senate Democrats to personally attack GOP judicial nominees.

In 2003, I was working on the committee for Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, when Judge Janice Rogers Brown and Judge Priscilla Owen received their respective nominations to the D.C. and 5th Circuit courts of appeals.

That year, for the first time in our nation’s history, Senate Democrats launched a filibuster attack on numerous Bush circuit court nominees. Two of their victims were Brown and Owen, of whom I can attest to their character and congeniality. What were their great crimes? They were conservative women — in the case of Judge Brown, she was a minority conservative woman.

For two years, Democrats continued the unprecedented filibustering and constant attacks. Brown and Owen were 2 of 10 circuit court nominees Democrats delayed or stopped during President George W. Bush’s first term. Brown and Owen were eventually confirmed, but not without cost.

Prior to Brown’s confirmation vote, Rep. Mel Watt, D-N.C., then chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, quipped Brown’s only qualification for the job was that she could be a person Republicans could put on the court whose “face is black.” Prior to her nomination, Brown was a California state Supreme Court judge with an outstanding record of achievement in both the public and private sectors. Yet Watt also accused her, a black woman, of being against the wants and needs of black Americans.

As for Owen, The New York Times editorial board argued Senate Democrats should once again filibuster her nomination to stop “extreme conservatives” from “hijacking the federal judiciary.” Owen is now the chief judge on the 5th Circuit.

While Brown and Owen made it through, the same cannot be said of Miguel Estrada, whose nomination Senate Democrats stopped. What was his crime? He was young, incredibly intelligent, capable, and — most importantly — Hispanic. That is a known truth in Washington, D.C., that nobody talks about openly, but the very Democrats I worked with on the other side of the aisle on the Judiciary Committee put that in writing.

A Nov. 7, 2001 memo to Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., from Democratic staffers on the committee explained they must stop Estrada’s nomination “because he has a minimal paper trail, he is Latino, and the White House seems to be grooming him for a Supreme Court appointment.”

After a brutal 28 months of filibustering, Senate Democrats, fueled by underlying racist rhetoric, made Estrada the first appeals court nominee in history to be successfully stopped by filibuster. Just over a year after he withdrew his nomination after unprecedented attacks on him personally, Estrada lost his wife in unfortunate circumstances. But the Democrats had their scalp: the destruction of Estrada, a conservative who could potentially have become the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice.

Unfortunately, it did not stop there. I remember the 2005 confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito. Ask Justice Alito’s lovely wife, Martha Ann, who broke into tears after Democrats cast baseless allegations at her husband in an attempt to undermine his moral character before the American people.

And we needn’t replay the complete circus of vitriolic attacks on now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh. It was again, right out of the playbook — this time a page from the confirmation of Justice Clarence Thomas. Senate Democrats, led by Joe Biden, embarked on perhaps the most disgusting assault on a person’s character we’ve ever witnessed in a hearing.

Justice Thomas explained in his hearing:

From my standpoint as a black American, as far as I’m concerned, it is a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves, to do for themselves, to have different ideas, and it is a message that unless you kowtow to an old order, this is what will happen to you. You will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the U.S. Senate, rather than hung from a tree.

Whenever I re-watch that response from Thomas, which he jams back down the throats of the Judiciary Committee senators, it is important to remember why he did so. It wasn’t for the Supreme Court. It was to defend his good name. Remember that.

Remember that Amy Coney Barrett is a human being. She is a mom, a wife, a friend, and a sitting judge who has a name and a reputation.

Remember that it was President Donald Trump who nominated her in the face of vitriol and hatred for doing so — despite the fact every president has done the same thing. Remember that the Senate’s job is to reject or confirm and that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did not embark on an effort to destroy Judge Merrick Garland’s reputation or sully his character, but simply exercised the rights of the majority not to confirm.

When Democrats see the futility of personal attacks against Barrett, and switch gears to an attack on judicial rulings and outcomes on votes on certain abortion laws or health-care laws, remember that it is her job is to interpret the law and the Constitution, not to make the law or re-write the Constitution.

Remember Democrats do not share this view and therefore justify the tearing down of fine public servants to achieve an end. The nation deserves better. Good for Judge Barrett for putting on the armor of God and taking the nomination of this president and standing up for America.

Why Democrats Might Take It Easy On Amy Coney Barrett,"When news of the passing of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg came down last month and President Trump made clear he intended to fill the vacancy, it also seemed clear Democrats would stop at nothing to stop it. When Trump nominated social conservative favorite Amy Coney Barrett such speculation went into overdrive with visions of the contentious Brett Kavanaugh hearings dancing in pundits’ heads. At the time I assumed this was all correct, but I am starting to have doubts.

It is certainly true that in some circles we have seen attacks on Barrett, her faith, her positions on abortion, and other issues. We had already seen three years ago in Barrett’s hearing for the circuit court that Sen. Diane Feinstein for one had no issue calling out the Catholic dogma that lives deep within Barrett. But when and if the hearings begin on October 12, do not be shocked if Democrats take a kinder and gentler tone, or if they just sit out the hearings all together.

The big difference between now and Kavanaugh is that the Democrats have no angle here. The biggest reason for this is that the current timeline offers them little chance of actually stopping the nomination and playing for more time. Recall that the Democrats’ plan during Kavanaugh was to drag out that process long enough that by the time there was a replacement nominee the Democrats could win back the Senate in the 2018 midterm. That is not going to happen here. Barring something bizarre, Barrett will be confirmed by the senate.

Another key difference is that Kavanaugh was caught up in the huge cultural phenomenon of the Me Too movement. 2018 was still a time when even the whiff of sexual misconduct would send powerful men into retirement and hiding. It was reasonable to assume Kavanaugh would not fight back, until he did. Not only that, he fought back effectively and won. This time around Democrats don’t even have a fabricated scandal, at least not yet, and there are real dangers in trying to manufacture one.

This is all about reward vs. risk. Let’s start with the former, what could Democrats gain with nasty hearings that call into question Barrett’s faith, or the adoption of her children from Haiti, or whatever else Democrats can pull out of their hat? It could fire up their base. That’s really about it. As noted above, they aren’t going to stop the nomination so this is purely political. And in an election year where their base already hates Donald Trump more than some guy in South Philly hates the Cowboys, rallying the base seems a bit pointless.

As to the risk, Amy Coney Barrett is not Brett Kavanaugh. The latter was out of central casting for a figure hated by progressives. He was like a grown up version Nicholas Sandmann, a punchable face if you will. Into the cup of Kavanaugh could be poured all the poison about white male privilege and prep school, and he likes beer! Barrett is a mother of 7, by all accounts a lovely person, and she holds herself with grace. Attempts to smear her could backfire spectacularly. The very white, college-educated, moderate, suburban women who Democrats are counting on might not like seeing attacks on a woman they could run into at the gym or the swap meet.

The best play for Senate Democrats and the Biden campaign right now would be to simply skip the hearings. It also makes the most logical sense based on their central argument. Their position is that filling this seat at all before the election and potential transition of power is illegitimate. They wrongly think that the deck has been unfairly stacked against them. This being the case, why sit down at the dealer’s table at all?

Conservative media has also done a good job protecting Barrett. The Kavanaugh craziness came out of left field, or at least appeared to, but this time the right is ready and expecting outrageous attacks on the nominee’s faith and her past. In almost perfect unison conservatives have warned that progressives will dirty themselves with attacks on Barrett, a trap has been laid. There is good reason to believe that Democrats will refuse to walk into it.

The bottom line is that Democrats can’t stop this nomination from going through. It will be a will be a win for Trump. The question is how big a win will it be? That depends entirely on how much skin Democrats put in the game. I suggest they put in none. In the coming weeks look for Democrats to continue slamming Trump for his choice to fill the seat, but do not be surprised if Barrett basically gets a pass. Going after her would very likely hurt Democrats’ chances next month far more than they would help them. And that is really the only thing that matters.

'Coalition On Adoption' Dems Silent On Smears Against Amy Coney Barrett's Children,"Senate Democrats serving on the Congressional Coalition on Adoption are turning a blind eye to pundit attacks on Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett’s adopted children as the federal judge faces hearings for the high bench this week.

On the day of her Rose Garden nomination ceremony, critical race theory scholar Ibram X. Kendi, author of the bestselling book, “How to Be an Antiracist,” condemned President Donald Trump’s nominee as a white supremacist for adopting two children from Haiti.

“Some White colonizers ‘adopted’ Black children,” Kendi wrote on Twitter. “They ‘civilized’ these ‘savage’ children in the ‘superior’ ways of White people, while using them as props in their lifelong pictures of denial, while cutting the biological parents of these children out of the picture of humanity.”

Some White colonizers ""adopted"" Black children. They ""civilized"" these ""savage"" children in the ""superior"" ways of White people, while using them as props in their lifelong pictures of denial, while cutting the biological parents of these children out of the picture of humanity. https://t.co/XBE9rRnoqq — Ibram X. Kendi (@DrIbram) September 26, 2020

Kendi was responding to a tweet featuring parents with black children that didn’t even depict Coney Barrett. Kendi said it didn’t matter.

“Whether this is Barrett or not is not the point. It is a belief too many White people have: if they have or adopt a child of color, then they can’t be racist,” Kendi wrote, because according to his own philosophy, absolutely nothing can abdicate white people of their inborn racism.

Every single Democrat serving on both the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Congressional Coalition on Adoption denied The Federalist’s repeated requests for comment, including Sens. Chris Coons of Delaware, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Dianne Feinstein of California, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who co-chairs the bicameral bipartisan caucus alongside Florida Democratic Rep. Donna Shalala, who also denied The Federalist’s request for comment.

Republican caucus leaders on the other hand, roundly condemned Kendi’s racist smears.

“The attacks on Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s faith and family are absolutely disgraceful,” said Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt, who also co-chairs the caucus. “The adoption caucus is the largest bipartisan, bicameral caucus in the Congress for a reason. Supporting adoptive families shouldn’t be a divisive issue. It’s shameful that anyone would make it one when there are millions of children in the world in need of a safe home and loving family.”

“In an attempts by Mr. Kendi to attack Amy Coney Barrett, he also attacked families across our country who are made up of adopted children from other races than the parents,” House Republican caucus co-chair Robert Aderholt of Alabama said in a statement to The Federalist. “To imply that white parents should only adopt white children and black children should only be adopted by black parents, is the pure definition of racism. The love a parent has for a child, whether biological or adopted, is color blind.”

The attacks also drew the ire of Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, a consistent champion for pro-adoption policies.

“Every child deserves a safe, stable and loving home, regardless of where they are born or what they look like,” Grassley told The Federalist. The insinuation that Judge Barrett’s family represents anything less than a loving example of care and compassion is disgraceful. Those cheap political attacks should be condemned by all sides.”

Democrats: It’s Trump’s Fault We’re Burning Down American Institutions,"When they aren’t too busy telling us the sky is falling, legacy media love to remind us that war is being waged on American institutions.

“American institutions are ‘under assault’ by Trump,” the Washington Post warns. “The President is winning his war on American institutions,” says the Atlantic, adding “If he’s given a few more years, the damage to American democracy will be irreversible.”

CNN explains “9 ways Trump has shredded U.S. institutions,” while Bloomberg News’ opinion editor writes about “Trump’s systematic attack on U.S. institutions.”

“Donald Trump from the beginning has seemed to pose a threat to the American system unlike any president in living memory,” writes Francis Fukuyama in Politico Magazine.

“Even for this president, it was a remarkable week of attacks on American institutions,” said The New York Times after the 2018 midterm elections.

Just what are those ambiguous institutions that are so endangered by the Trump administration? Trump’s concerns about voter fraud endanger the electoral process, say the media. He has undermined trust in the intelligence community and in U.S. government overall by publicly noting that subversive surveillance of the Trump campaign in 2016 actually happened. He’s also attacking the judicial system by criticizing judges and decisions he disagrees with (although Democrats’ proposal to pack the Supreme Court for partisan motives is apparently no problem).

The media further accuse Trump of filling government positions with political loyalists, and challenging the vast layers of bureaucracy that have plagued government for decades. Maybe worst of all, Trump has criticized the media establishment itself.

While the left hand-wrings about Trump now, they have spent decades torching American institutions. These institutions are foundational to others like government, the media, and elections.

Nuking The Nuclear Family

Most primally, the institution of the family is now playing defense against decades of leftist attacks. Some attacks are overt, like the Black Lives Matter organization’s expressed goal to “disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement.” In July, the Smithsonian released an infographic listing the “nuclear family” as a part of “white culture.” On the same webpage, the Smithsonian urged readers to face their whiteness and “recognize their fragility.”

Meanwhile, The Atlantic cheered “The Rise of the 3-Parent Family,” in a September article tracing the falsified popularity of tri-parent households. The article misrepresented a Pew Research report about the number of children in two-parent households, but this didn’t keep the author from celebrating the supposed demise of organic family structure. “The idea that the default family unit consists of two straight parents and their children is outdated,” she said.

These attacks on the organic family have been gaining steam since the Sexual Revolution of the 1960s. With the advent of the Pill and legalization of abortion, sex became more casual and more acceptable outside of marriage. Third-wave feminism discouraged women from raising a family. Predictably, the percent of American children living with their two married biological parents dropped from 87 percent in 1960 to 61 percent in 2014.

While the heightened dangers of growing up in divorced or single-parent homes are certainly not inevitable, they are sobering. Children whose parents are divorced are statistically more likely to make similar choices. A Harvard study found that growing up with a single parent was a significant factor holding back a child’s upward income mobility. The family is the laboratory where a child learns how to interact with the world, and his family circumstances will strongly shape his approach.

Attacks On the Church

Another institution the left fires upon constantly is church. Most recently, arbitrary restrictions from state and local leaders hamstrung churches from congregational fellowship. In California, Kentucky, Virginia, North Carolina, and elsewhere, governments have recorded license plate numbers of church attendees, threatened to imprison pastors, and fully banned congregational worship.

Long before COVID-19, leftist attacks on religious freedom were concerning. The Family Research Council published a list of unjust restrictions on religious exercise in 2014. A few of the instances in the 40-page document involved: seniors barred from singing Christmas carols, criticism of a “Mother Theresa” stamp, banning prayer before meals at an Illinois homeless shelter, a high schooler threatened with arrest for praying in her graduation speech, and firefighters forced to participate in a gay pride parade. The updated 2017 report showed that these kinds of attacks had grown by 76 percent in three years.

While these incidents are increasing, constitutional protections for religious liberty are eroding. In 1990, writing the majority opinion for Employment Division v. Smith, the usually originalist Justice Antonin Scalia re-categorized free exercise of religion as a “hybrid” right, which needed to be combined with another constitutional right to merit full protection. The Smith decision made it easier for laws restricting religious freedom to be upheld.

Just this year, in Bostock v. Clayton County, the Supreme Court redefined Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to include “sexual orientation” in the word “sex,” making it illegal to fire an employee on the basis of his or her gender identity. While some religious freedom exceptions may exist for now, the court left unanswered how Bostock will interact with free exercise. Lower-court decisions since indicate the answer is in a decided negative.

A Re-telling Of History

Political theorist Edmund Burke envisioned a social contract between current generations, their predecessors, and their descendants. Appreciating past generations and recognizing obligations to future ones encourages us to steward society well, Burke said.

This appreciation for history does not entail blind worship of our forefathers’ actions, but thoughtful evaluation of them. We should recognize our historical faults as we celebrate our historical accomplishments — but neither of these is possible if we do not know our history.

In 2011, before President Obama canceled the tests informing the public of this important metric, The New York Times reported that only 12 percent of high school seniors were proficient in U.S. history. Only 2 of every 100 students could answer a question about Brown v. Board of Education, the landmark Supreme Court decision that struck down racial segregation in schools. Not only are we rapidly forgetting our history, but the history students are learning is deeply critical of the past, and sometimes patently inaccurate.

The 1619 Project, for example, is a set of essays positing that America’s proper beginning was not 1776 but 1619, the “beginning of American slavery.” Curriculum from the 1619 Project has already been taught to students in 4,500 classrooms.

“Nearly everything that has made America truly exceptional,” says the 1619 Project, has come from slavery and racism. These include everything from America’s pop music to “the example it sets for the world as a land of freedom and equality.” Nikole Hannah-Jones, the architect of the 1619 Project, had to issue a correction about her completely unfounded claim that the American War for Independence was fought to preserve slavery.

This year, a Virginia school district also dropped $20,000 for students to have a one-hour conversation with sworn anticapitalist Ibram X. Kendi. They spent another $24,000 on his books for a U.S. history class. Far from history textbooks, Kendi’s books are about “How To Be An Anti-Racist” and “Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You.” They monetize anti-white racism. Kendi has also suggested U.S. Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett was a “white colonizer” for adopting two children from Haiti.

The institutions of family, the church, and history aren’t the only ones necessary for a thriving society. But they are foundational. If we hope to keep other American institutions like our system of government intact, then we must preserve those central fixtures instead of joining the left in blowing them to smithereens.

Why Does The Washington Post Hate Supreme Court Nominees’ Children So Much?,"The Washington Post ran the campaign to keep Brett Kavanaugh off of the Supreme Court. Before they laundered and massaged Christine Blasey Ford’s unsubstantiated claim against then-Judge Kavanaugh, the paper had spent months trying to find other avenues to tear him down.

From the moment he accepted his nomination on July 9, 2018, the Washington Post was harshly critical. His invocation of his mother and other key women in his life was “remarkably political” according to senior political writer Aaron Blake’s initial write-up. On July 11, the Post broke the news that Brett Kavanaugh had bought group tickets for the Washington Nationals baseball games on his own credit card before being reimbursed by his friends. This launched efforts to crowd-source photos of Kavanaugh enjoying sporting events.

Some critics went after him for, and this is not a joke, refraining from putting toppings on his pizza. These attacks were considered so laughable that Twitter users began using the hashtag #KavanaughScandals. “He neglected to add the plus 4 zip codes on all his Christmas cards,” “Didn’t rewind a VHS before taking it back to Blockbuster,” and “Sources say that Kavanaugh once failed to turn off his brights for an oncoming vehicle.” The Onion ran an article headlined “Kavanaugh Nomination Falters after Washington Post Publishes Shocking Editorial Claiming He Forgot Daughter’s Piano Recital.”

The Washington Post has continued to lean into its role of fighting Republican judicial nominees with the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett. Emma Brown, the same reporter who was used to filter the Blasey Ford allegations and massage their many problems, was put on the anti-Coney Barrett beat. Her 2,500-word critique of Coney Barrett’s religious community landed with a thud, treated as the bigotry it was instead of real journalism.

A follow-up attack of Coney Barrett’s children also failed to launch. Beth Reinhard and her editors published a piece with a headline that suggested the Coney Barrett children had spread COVID-19 within their school. In fact, the children had tested negative and had no ties to the two children at the school testing positive. For some reason, Reinhard tweeted out the White House’s response to her attack on underage children, a response that all sane Americans agreed with:

Presumably, if the past is prologue, the Post is preparing for its participation in a last-minute attack on Coney Barrett once her hearings have concluded. In the meantime, we’re left with Robin Givhan, the Washington Post’s Pulitzer Prize-winning fashion critic.

Two of Givhan’s pieces were so vile and hateful that I actually remember them. The first was so bad that it may have contributed to my becoming a media critic. It was November 18, 2000. I was at Jimmy T’s diner in Washington, D.C., reading a histrionic attack on Florida’s Republican Secretary of State Katherine Harris that was so bad that I went back up to the top and looked at who wrote it: Robin Givhan.

The piece was such an embarrassment to the Washington Post that its own ombudsman Michael Getler wrote that “Ms. Givhan’s treatment of Ms. Harris, in the view of many Washington Post readers — including the ombudsman — was a classic example of the arrogance of journalists that undermines people’s confidence in the media.”

Givhan was so overcome by her hatred of George W. Bush that she wrote, “At this moment that so desperately needs diplomacy, understatement and calm, one wonders how this Republican woman, who can’t even use restraint when she’s wielding a mascara wand, will manage to use it and make sound decisions in this game of partisan one-upmanship.” She added, “Her skin had been plastered and powdered to the texture of pre-war walls … (S)he looked as if she were wearing a mask … The American public doesn’t like falsehoods, and Harris is clearly presenting herself in a fake manner … Why should anyone trust her?”

Other journalists noted Givhan’s hatred as well. James Pinkerton in the Los Angeles Times wrote:

But by far the fiercest attack on Harris came from the Washington Post’s Robin Givhan, a fashion writer, who was moved to this flight of misogyny last week: ‘Her lips were overdrawn with berry-red lipstick–the creamy sort that smears all over a coffee cup and leaves smudges on shirt collars. Her skin had been plastered and powdered to the texture of prewar walls in need of a skim coat. And her eyes, rimmed in liner and frosted with blue shadow, bore the telltale homogenous spikes of false eyelashes. Caterpillars seemed to rise and fall with every bat of her eyelid.’

Pinkerton said Givhan’s “ultimate purpose” was to “delegitimize Harris as an electoral arbiter.”

Which brings us to the second piece, Givhan’s attack on one Supreme Court nominee’s children. Givhan viciously mocked the seer-sucker short-suit and yellow dress worn by Chief Justice John Roberts’ son and daughter. She kept saying she meant to attack their clothing, and not the children, but her effort was a failure, describing Roberts’ wife and children as looking “like a trio of Easter eggs, a handful of Jelly Bellies, three little Necco wafers.” The piece was headlined “An Image A Little Too Carefully Coordinated,” and said that “the Roberts family went too far” and had failed to dress in “commonly accepted styles of this century.”

Reasonable people were horrified and Givhan won the Pulitzer the following year for her partisan and anti-child invective.

So it was completely unsurprising that Givhan attacked Amy Coney Barrett’s children Monday. “Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett has seven kids. And don’t you dare forget it,” her piece was headline. The hearing was “child-obsessed,” she claimed, mocking the kind remarks she received from senators for her lovely family. She wrote:

This feat of parenting seemed to leave them gobsmacked with admiration and utterly mystified as to how a two-parent household with significant financial resources was capable of wrangling such a large brood without the missus showing up with oatmeal on her clothes. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) couldn’t contain himself from acknowledging that not only did Barrett have a big family of her own, but she also was the product of one, just like him. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) was impressed by her kids’ good behavior and said he was hoping for parenting tips.

Heaven forfend!

Givhan used her column for some handy personal therapy that in no way suggested she felt personally empty and sad, writing:

The many references to Barrett’s children were a not-so-subtle pronouncement that her prolific motherhood was especially good and admirable and a sign that she was not shirking her womanly duty while she was unleashing her ambition. Barrett had it all — on terms that were acceptable to social conservatives.

She later opined, falsely, that “To hear the Republicans tell it, children are Barrett’s most distinguished qualifications. Fatherhood on a potential justice’s curriculum vitae has not elicited a similarly boastful torrent.”

In fact, when Antonin Scalia sat for his confirmation hearings, his fatherhood of nine children was commonly remarked upon. Republican Chairman Strom Thurmond mentioned the children in his opening statement on the hearings. Sen. Howell Heflin, a Democrat from Alabama, remarked, “I also am delighted to welcome your wife and your nine children. Looking at the number of your children, it appears that you have had much experience in working with groups of nine.” Sen. John Warner of Virginia said Scalia “has the ability to successfully manage, together with his lovely wife, a family of nine children. That indicates something about his temperament as a future Justice of the Supreme Court.” Sen. Howard Metzenbaum mentioned them, adding that he didn’t think the poor children needed to “sit through these laborious, tedious hearings” since it is a “rather tiring process for young children.” Sen. Patrick Leahy, who is still on the committee today, said the children had the best of both worlds — an Italian father and an Irish mother. He also offered his office for a place the children could rest so they didn’t have to sit through the hearings.

Givhan went on to get upset at people in any way discussing Barrett’s two adopted children. She got upset that one Republican senator had the audacity to remind the world of Democrats’ behavior against Brett Kavanaugh. And then, finally, the fashion critic got to the fashion. She noted that Coney Barrett wore “a non-wrinkling dress in a jubilant shade of magenta.” And then she sneered that Barrett had mentioned she’d be the first Supreme Court justice to be a mother of school-age children.

Compared to the Daily Beast’s meltdown over the dress, Givhan’s lack of discussion was fine.

The Daily Beast’s Alaina Demopoulos was an emotional wreck as she tried to balance her genuine love of Coney Barrett’s look with her hatred of the woman and all those who don’t share her political goals. She admitted that the dress “looked sensible, practical, and stoically feminine” and was pretty and “even stylish by D.C.’s standards.” The “deep pink color of Barrett’s might not be youthful, exactly, but there is some life to it—underscoring her relatively young age” and “made a statement.” It “stood out in a room full of anodyne blue and black suits; it spoke of soft prettiness when the proceedings are about the very opposite. Her outfit radiates a maternal warmth, an easy comfort. It hides her staunchly right-wing record.”

Demopoulos said “the dress labored overtime to quell certain fears. How could anyone who looks this safe be a threat?” but that she was “outfitted as the caricature of a mother, or at least the right’s archetype of one.” Demopoulos veered all over the place as she struggled to explain how someone she viewed as so evil could look that good.

In any case, in the sane parts of the universe, Coney Barrett looked beautiful for her first day of the hearing. She wore a forceful but feminine dress that was well suited for an introduction of who she is as a person.

A quick shout out to the Washington Post’s Karen Tumulty who managed to note the beautiful dress in about as neutral a way as possible. Journalist Autumn Brennington also discussed the outfit in a neutral and appropriate way, highlighting that the Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton also wears the same designer.

The second day of the hearing, in which more substantive questions were asked, featured a more serious suit with a jacket, also appropriate to the moment.

Amy Coney Barrett Denounces Vile Attacks On Her Adopted Children,"During Tuesday’s confirmation hearing, Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett addressed repeated vile attacks on her family and her adopted children.

“They are my children who we love and who we brought home and made part of our family,” Barrett said, “and accusations like that are cruel.”

Sen. John Kennedy asks ACB about Boston University's @DrIbram saying that she is a ""white colonist"" for adopting two Haitian children: ""They are my children who we love and who we brought home and made part of our family and accusations like that are cruel."" pic.twitter.com/tgrhUe2zM4 — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) October 13, 2020

“Some butthead professor at Boston University says that because you and your husband have two children of color, that you’re a white colonist,” said Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy to Barrett. “The implication is that you’re a racist. And that you use your two children as props,” he added. “Do you use your children as props?”

Barrett responded, “It was the risk of people saying things like that, which would be so hurtful to my family, that… I had to really weigh the costs of this.” Barrett said that the “deeply offensive” attacks on her adoptions are not only hurtful to her but also to her children, “who we love and who we brought home and made part of our family.”

WATCH: Here’s What We Think About Amy Coney Barrett

The “butthead” who labeled Barrett a white supremacist for adopting two children from Haiti is the left-feted critical race theorist Ibram X. Kendi. Kendi, author of the bestselling book, “How to Be an Antiracist,” wrote on Twitter: “Some White colonizers ‘adopted’ Black children. They ‘civilized’ these ‘savage’ children in the ‘superior’ ways of White people, while using them as props in their lifelong pictures of denial, while cutting the biological parents of these children out of the picture of humanity.”

Kendi (@DrIbram) September 26, 2020

Kendi was responding to a tweet featuring parents with black children just hours after Barrett’s nomination was announced.

“Whether this is Barrett or not is not the point. It is a belief too many White people have: if they have or adopt a child of color, then they can’t be racist,” Kendi tweeted.

“Next Gen America” managing director John Lee Brougher was another critic of Barrett’s adopted family. “As an adoptee, I need to know more about the circumstances of how Amy Coney Barrett came to adopt her children, and the treatment of them since,” Brougher wrote. “Transracial adoption is fraught with trauma and potential for harm, and everything I see here is deeply concerning.”

Democratic activist Dana Houle said he would “love to know which adoption agency Amy Coney Barrett and her husband used to adopt the two children they brought here from Haiti.”

“Does the press even investigate details of Barrett’s adoptions from Haiti,” Houle asked. “Some adoptions from Haiti were legit. Many were sketchy as h-ll. And if press learned they were unethical and illegal adoptions, would they report it? Or not, bc it involves her children.”

The Federalist reported Tuesday that Senate Democrats serving on the Congressional Coalition on Adoption are turning a blind eye to these attacks on Barrett’s adopted children.

Every single Democrat serving on both the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Congressional Coalition on Adoption denied The Federalist’s repeated requests for comment, including Sens. Chris Coons of Delaware, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Dianne Feinstein of California, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who co-chairs the bicameral bipartisan caucus alongside Florida Democratic Rep. Donna Shalala, who also denied The Federalist’s request for comment.

On the other side of the aisle, Republican caucus leaders resoundingly condemned the vile smears against Barrett, her husband, and their adopted children.

“How low can you go,” said Kennedy at the hearing Tuesday. “I’m sorry you had to go through that,” he told Barrett.

Joe Biden Has Said Nothing About The Violent Attacks On Trump Supporters,"Former Vice President Joe Biden has yet to condemn the violent attacks on Trump supporters over the weekend in the nation’s capital.

While tens of thousands took to the streets of Washington, D.C. for the “Million MAGA March” on Saturday afternoon to show their support for President Trump and call for voting fraud investigations, counter-protests later in the evening turned violent when leftists wearing Antifa and Black Lives Matter garb verbally and physically assaulted Trump supporters in the streets.

While Biden had ample opportunity and time on the Monday following the violence, he did not acknowledge nor condemn the politically-motivated attacks against the Trump supporters, young and old, who were peacefully protesting or simply walking back to their hotels when they were assaulted.

Biden interacted with reporters on Monday, but none of their questions touched on the weekend’s incidents and the political intimidation exercised by violent people on the left.

Biden took about 12 questions from reporters today. Not one was about the violence against Trump supporters in the streets of DC. No one asked him to condemn it. If Biden supporters were attacked, the only questions to Trump would be about violence, demanding that he condemn it. — Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) November 16, 2020

First 5 questions for Biden, 4 focused on Trump. Non-Trump question was about an executive order relieving student debt. Biden occasionally looked at notes during some answers. Reporters stepped up to a microphone in a pre-determined order, they weren’t randomly called upon. — Joe Concha (@JoeConchaTV) November 16, 2020

Trump quickly denounced the attacks on Twitter, saying that the onslaughts were committed by “radical left Antifa scum.”

“Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!” he wrote.

https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1327834542707793921?s=20

Earlier in the election cycle, Democrats and the media heavily criticized Trump for what they claim to be him refusing to denounce white supremacy on the first presidential debate stage.

Debate moderator Chris Wallace asked if the president was “willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia groups?” Trump immediately replied, “Sure.”

While Trump has very early stated his opposition to white supremacy and hate groups that perpetrate it in the past as well as on the debate stage, headlines following the first debate misconstrued the issue and reporters assailed the president and his staff for days with similar questions, insinuating that the administration willingly promotes racism.

Left Attacks Scott Atlas For Saying Same Things About COVID NYT Does,"The evidence continues to accrue that the dominant policies sold to mitigate the COVID-19 outbreak were catastrophically wrong, yet those who pointed this out early on continue to be reputationally crucified by media and Democrat elites. A premiere case in point is White House Coronavirus Task Force member Dr. Scott Atlas, who has been making science-based arguments against locking down healthy people since the earliest months of the pandemic.

Because he has courageously presented evidence that gums up the media’s goal of ending Trump’s presidency by using coronavirus to punish Americans, the knives have been out for the views Atlas represents since the beginning.

Atlas is not at all alone in professional skepticism about the value of extended lockdowns, cloth masks, and obsessing about case counts as opposed to hospitalizations and deaths. So far, more than 12,000 medical and public health scientists and more than 35,000 medical professionals from around the world have signed the Great Barrington Declaration that summarizes this advocacy of “focused protection.”

Atlas is just a prominent face for this view that the power-hungry elites need to crush to avoid responsibility for their horrifically bad leadership during the COVID outbreak, as well as to get Trump. So they seek to destroy him because he and the scientific coalition he represents makes it clear that these public health emperors may have plenty of masks, but no clothes.

Thus YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook have repeatedly banned or slapped warnings on Atlas’s statements and all scientific evidence that might support the Great Barrington view. This week a former Obama official called for Atlas’s medical license to be revoked for the crime of practicing science.

Things like this are not only anti-science, they are anti-public health. Yanking Atlas’s license because he participated in the scientific process by challenging interpretations of evidence with more evidence will not only end scientific advancement, it will legitimize the growing anti-vaccine movement by providing a legitimate martyr to rally around instead of a fake one.

Anyone who cares about public health should not be giving people more reasons to distrust the people who stamp their foreheads with “public health expert.” That is what all this suppression of research and of discourse does. It is also what all the personal attacks on people like Atlas do. Refusing to engage with the evidence he cites and instead attacking his professional background — “he’s only a radiologist, not an epidemiologist”– or smearing him — “he’s a grandma killer” — makes the people doing this look like the real hacks.

The only way to legitimately destroy Atlas’s credibility would be to engage with him on the science, to point out where his arguments are wrong or weak or what they are missing. This is called the scientific process, and it is essential to the advancement of knowledge. Since very little of that has been forthcoming, the thinking public is left to assume his coalition’s stance is legitimate and the people who use dirty tactics are attempting to avoid facing that their policies have devastated the world while possibly causing additional deaths.

Evidence Mounts that Focused Protection Is Right

Indeed, the evidence continues to mount that those who advocate for focused protection have been right about their interpretation of the science for months. Like other public health experts including the World Health Organization and Dr. Anthony Fauci before he reversed himself, Atlas has long pointed out that the preponderance of better-quality evidence about masks shows mandates for the general public to wear them accomplish no significant public health value.

Just this week a large-scale Danish study was finally released. This randomized controlled trial, the highest-quality scientific study available, found that those who wore masks were not statistically less likely to contract COVID-19 than those who did not wear masks.

As The Spectator UK pointed out, “The results of the Danmask-19 trial mirror other reviews into influenza-like illnesses. Nine other trials looking at the efficacy of masks (two looking at healthcare workers and seven at community transmission) have found that masks make little or no difference to whether you get influenza or not.”

Those who say these results are because “my mask protects you, and your mask protects me” need to take a long and hard look at the fact that countries, states, and cities with near-universal mask-wearing have the same patterns of COVID spread. “No matter how strictly mask laws are enforced nor the level of mask compliance the population follows, cases all fall and rise around the same time,” notes a recent Federalist roundup of such examples. This is likely why Fauci, who criticizes Atlas’s statements publicly, doesn’t wear masks when the cameras aren’t on.

Atlas Was Right About Immune Response

Atlas has consistently stood against depictions of data that encouraged a hysterical response to COVID. In a widely publicized exchange in September, for example, Atlas pointed out that Dr. Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control, exaggerated how many Americans were still threatened by the Wuhan virus.

Redfield said “more than 90 percent” of Americans were still susceptible. Atlas pointed out that much of the data underlying this claim was old, taken from early in the outbreak, and that “about 24 papers at least” had shown that people who haven’t contracted SARS-CoV-2 can have an immune response to it, presumably from having fought off other coronaviruses. This meant that many more Americans than the 9 percent Redfield claimed would have some level of protection against COVID if they chanced to encounter it.

At the time, the NBC reporter questioning Atlas was incredulous, and the exchange set off another round of media and bureaucrat attacks on Atlas, calling his promotion of herd immunity — a goal of any basic public health response to infectious diseases! — “unethical” and “unachievable.” Now that Joe Biden is presumed to soon be president, however, The New York Times saw fit to finally report on the research reinforcing Atlas’s explanation of T-cell, antibody, and other immune responses and protections against COVID.

“How long might immunity to the coronavirus last? Years, maybe even decades, according to a new study … Eight months after infection, most people who have recovered still have enough immune cells to fend off the virus and prevent illness, the new data show. A slow rate of decline in the short term suggests, happily, that these cells may persist in the body for a very, very long time to come,” the Nov. 17 Times article says.

It goes on to cite research on other coronaviruses showing similarly long-lasting protection for many people from the frightful hospital stays corporate media has hyped for eight months. It even cites the exact same study Atlas did on SARS, showing that the protective T-cell immune response lasted at least 17 years. He was attacked for it, and claims like this are flagged by “fact-checkers” for social media like Facebook. Not The New York Times, though, when it says exactly the same thing.

Yes, the Research Supports Keeping Schools Open

Leftist writers like Nicholas Kristof at The New York Times are also now trying to retcon the fact that it was Democrats and their media allies who demanded school shutdowns, due not only to their political need for coronavirus hysteria but also their ties to teachers unions. Biden’s own national school closures plan mimicked the New York City one with arbitrary targets based on conjecture.

Leftist media and politicians brutalized Atlas and others for pointing out early in the outbreak that children are the lowest-risk group for coronavirus contraction and complications. Yet highly influential dual-income parents in blue places like New York City are now in uproar about rolling blackouts and brownouts of their children’s education based on nonsensical metrics like a 3 percent infection rate (if the infection has mild consequences for nearly all children and most teachers, who are also comparatively young, why shut down schools even if there are infections?).

“Trump has been demanding for months that schools reopen, and on that he seems to have been largely right,” Kristof wrote on Nov. 18. “Schools, especially elementary schools, do not appear to have been major sources of coronavirus transmission, and remote learning is proving to be a catastrophe for many low-income children.”

Some of us pointed this out in April, back when much of this damage could have been prevented. We were throttled on Facebook and Twitter, and our children held hostage to these lies for nearly an entire school year now. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was heckled and cast as a would-be child murderer on grounds a single child might get COVID if kids went back to school. American children’s safety and futures has been sacrificed because too many adults have been cowards more concerned with protecting their egos than acting courageously and prudently.

Herd Immunity Is Not Controversial to Scientists

Let’s all repeat the scientific facts: Most of us are going to get COVID, either through a natural infection or a stimulated immune response from a vaccine. There is no way to prevent that. There are only ways to mitigate it. Lockdowns are one way, but they have extremely high costs concentrated on the poor. Children and other young people — those under age 60 — are the most likely to not only survive a COVID infection, but also the most likely to experience a relatively mild case when they do get it. All this is scientifically indisputable.

The conclusion the Great Barrington types derive from these facts and others is that those under 60 and without comorbidities should thus live normally. Those who are least likely to be harmed by a COVID case should accrue herd immunity as quickly as prudently possible on behalf of the vulnerable.

In response to this charitable view based on scientific evidence and arguments, the left, often using Fauci, Deborah Birx, and Redfield, have crucified the characters and careers of those, like Atlas, who have dared to espouse it. As a consequence, hundreds of millions of Americans are being needlessly forced to suffer with no end in sight. We are caught in the crossfire of a giant ego war between people of cowardly, self-serving, intellectually narrow, and deceitful character.

Those who tell us the truth about all this are publicly shamed while those who lie to us are feted. Societies that punish the good and reward the evil sow the wind.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/11/20/left-attacks-scott-atlas-for-saying-same-things-about-covid-as-the-new-york-times-six-months-earlier/,2020-11-20
Susan Rice's Domestic Policy Will Just Be Her Foreign Policy Renamed,"Susan Rice, former UN Ambassador and National Security Adviser under President Barack Obama, is set to become Biden’s domestic policy adviser, but her only experience is in foreign policy, an area in which she has continually failed the American people.

While the Biden transition team’s press release claimed that “Rice is among our nation’s most senior and experienced government leaders with the skills to harness the power of the federal government to serve the American people,” Rice does not have a domestic policy record worth lauding.

As a matter of fact, her political resume solely consists of foreign policy spanning from her time as the assistant secretary of state for African affairs in the Clinton State Department, her position as a senior foreign policy fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institute, her time as senior foreign policy adviser for the Kerry/Edwards presidential campaign, serving as American ambassador to the U.N. and eventually becoming Obama’s national security advisor. She concluded her time in the Obama White House only to move on to American University as a visiting research fellow focused on, you guessed it, foreign policy.

This resume, while expected for someone lobbying for a foreign policy position in an incoming administration, does not equate to a domestic policy record, leaving many to speculate about the political benefits Biden sees in naming her to the position.

Rice’s lack of domestic policy was viewed as a positive in her race for Biden’s vice-presidential pick, but now that she’s named to the domestic policy adviser position, it’s cause for concern that her position on a number of domestic policy issues are unknown.

Yet, Biden chose her to join the White House, strategically pushing her past a risky and challenging Senate confirmation, a concern of Rice and other Democrats who wanted her in the Secretary of State position in the past.

Regardless of how or why she landed a spot in the domestic side of the Biden administration with exactly zero domestic policy qualifications, Rice’s reliance on her foreign policy background to inform her new position should be concerning to many Americans.

Not only did she falsely claim that the deaths of four Americans at Benghazi were the result of a spontaneous demonstration, but she also engaged with Russian collusion hoaxers to target Michael Flynn, and still refuses to answer questions about her knowledge of the Biden family’s foreign business affairs.

1. Benghazi, Libya

While Rice was not national security advisor in 2012 when terrorists attacked the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, she publicly weighed in on the situation, making false claims that the deaths of Americans were simply the result of demonstrations in Cairo over a video criticizing Islam gone wrong.

“Our current best assessment, based on the information that we have at present, is that, in fact, what this began as, it was a spontaneous — not a premeditated — response to what had transpired in Cairo. In Cairo, as you know, a few hours earlier, there was a violent protest that was undertaken in reaction to this very offensive video that was disseminated,” she told Jake Tapper on ABC’s “This Week” the Sunday after the attack.

“Based on the best information we have to date, what our assessment is as of the present is in fact what began spontaneously in Benghazi as a reaction to what had transpired some hours earlier in Cairo where, of course, as you know, there was a violent protest outside of our embassy– –sparked by this hateful video,” she echoed in an interview on CBS.

“We do not– we do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned,” she continued.

Despite her claims, State Department documents contain an email that confirms the Obama administration knew the day after the Sept. 11 attack that it was not “a random act of violence stemming from an anti-Muslim video.”

On a September 12, 2012 phone call, State Department Under-Secretary Patrick Kennedy also clearly stated that “this was a direct breaching attack” and was not connected to the Cairo protests or video cited by officials shifting the blame around for the attack.

“The attack in Cairo was a demonstration. There were no weapons shown or used. A few cans of spray paint,” he clarified.

2. Hunter Biden

Rice first became national security adviser to Obama in 2013, around the same time that then-Vice President Joe Biden used Air Force Two on “an official government trip to China,” accompanied by his son Hunter Biden who began meeting with Chinese businessmen to “build a Chinese private equity firm,” which Hunter would sit on the board of. Just days after the joint trip, Shanghai authorities approved the firm with a Chinese business license.

Since the Biden family’s trip, the firm reportedly channeled at least $2.5 billion into automotive, energy, mining, and technology deals on behalf of investors, including a joint acquisition of the Michigan motor company Henniges in 2015, “the biggest Chinese investment into U.S. automotive manufacturing assets to date,” during Rice’s tenure as national security adviser.

Emails uncovered by the New York Post from a laptop allegedly belonging to Hunter Biden and published in October show that Joe and his family stood to profit from some of his son’s deals with officials linked to the Chinese Communist Party (CPP), which Hunter said would be “interesting to me and my family.”

“An email dated for May 13, 2017 obtained by Fox News features talk of ‘remuneration packages’ for six individuals with a multi-million dollar deal with a Chinese energy company. The same email identified Hunter Biden as the “Chair / Vice Chair depending on agreement with CEFC.” CEFC China Energy Co. Ltd. is the Chinese energy firm founded by Ye Jianming, who held positions with the CCP and reportedly offered Hunter Biden $10 million a year for introductions alone,” The Federalist previously reported.

In 2014, while Rice was still in her position, Hunter joined the executive board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, making more than $50,000 a month while Joe served as the Obama admin’s “public face” for U.S. policy concerning Ukraine. A Federalist analysis of Hunter Biden’s pay reveals he was being showered in excess compensation nearly double the salaries of board members with larger corporations within the same industry, despite having no experience in the field.

It was during this time that, while Joe repeatedly lied when claiming he never spoke with Hunter, “or with anyone else,” about his son’s potentially criminal overseas business activity, Hunter introduced a senior advisor named Vadym Pozharskyi to his Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, to his vice president father.

“Thank you for inviting me to DC and giving me an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together,” Pozharskyi, wrote in an email recovered by the Post.

3. Michael Flynn

During her time as Obama’s “right-hand woman,” Rice lied about her involvement in the Obama admin’s targeting of the Trump campaign and her role in the unmasking for her successor Michael Flynn.

Not only did Rice “request the identities of U.S. persons in raw intelligence reports on dozens of occasions that connect to the Donald Trump transition and campaign, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter,” but she lied about it claiming she knew “nothing about this.”

Just weeks later, Rice admitted she tried to unmask information on Trump and his associates and family members, strategically claiming that it was “absolutely not for any political purposes.”

Later in 2017, CNN reported that Rice told House investigators that she had unmasked some senior Trump officials “to understand why the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates was in New York late last year.”

According to the report, the Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan had circumvented some diplomatic courtesy, which, apparently, was enough justification to spy on American citizens.

In May of 2020, it was revealed that Rice assisted in the Obama admin’s targeting of Flynn, sending herself an email on Trump’s inauguration day, “detailing the Jan. 5 meeting between her, Obama, then-Vice President Joe Biden, then-Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, and fired former Federal Bureau of Investigations Director James Comey.”

In the emails, Rice details her knowledge of the admin’s singling out of Flynn, who they claimed to be concerned about due to Russian connections and potentially withhold sensitive security information from.

“Comey said he does have some concerns that incoming NSA Flynn is speaking frequently with Russian Ambassador Kislyak,” Rice wrote. “Comey said that could be an issue as it relates to sharing sensitive information.”

“President Obama asked if Comey was saying the NSC should not pass sensitive information related to Russia to Flynn,” Rice continued. “Comey replied ‘potentially.’”

“[Comey] added that he has no indication thus far that Flynn has passed classified information to Kislyak, but he noted that ‘the level of communication is unusual.’”

If Rice’s handling of these issues is any indication of how she plans to approach U.S. domestic policy, Americans should be concerned. Rice’s foreign policy experience is littered with liabilities and without any domestic policy experience, it’s hard to see how she wouldn’t rely on her previous roles to carry out new policies through her role in the Biden admin.

It’s Long Past Time To Get U.S. Troops All The Way Out Of Somalia,"On Dec. 4, President Trump ordered most of the approximately 700 U.S. troops out of Somalia. The move wasn’t a full withdrawal, however, as the White House specified the forces will be moved to neighboring countries to continue targeting the al-Shabaab terror group. While addressing the tactical actions our troops would continue to perform in Africa, there was no mention of the strategic justification for our presence—because there is none.

Al-Shabaab is unquestionably a bloodthirsty terror group that doesn’t think twice about killing large numbers of innocent people in Somalia and elsewhere in Africa. As bad as they are, however, they do not pose a threat to America that cannot be handled more effectively by our global intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance networks and ability to strike direct threats to our country, regardless of where in the world the threat originates.

Al-Shabaab began as the militant wing of the Union of Islamic Courts in the mid-2000s in Mogadishu. The Congressional Research Service defines the group’s objectives as being to unify “ethnic Somali-inhabited areas of Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti, and Somalia under an Islamist government.” Although al-Shabaab has an open affiliation with al-Qaeda, its primary objectives remain local.

To the extent they attack non-Somali targets, the overriding imperative is to attack entities or personnel that target al-Shabaab. They have launched attacks in Uganda, Djibouti, and Kenya against members of the UN-authorized Africa Union Mission in Somalia that regularly fights against al-Shabaab.

In January, al-Shabaab militants attacked the Manda Bay Airfield in Kenya, a military facility the United States uses, killing a U.S. soldier and two civilian contractors. If the American military were not actively conducting combat operations in Africa, al-Shabaab would have no opportunity to harm them.

In a report to Congress last September, the inspector general of the East Africa Counterterrorism Operation claimed al-Shabaab had the “intent” to attack the American homeland but conceded that it “lacks the ability to do so.”

It should be self-evident that it is wholly unnecessary to maintain robust and ongoing combat operations in the vast continent of Africa to launch attacks against a militant group that claims to want to attack the United States but doesn’t have the ability to carry through on its desires. Further, as has so often been the case in America’s inconclusive use of lethal military power since 9/11, the mission in Africa is not militarily attainable.

The U.S. military mission in east Africa is “to disrupt, degrade, and deny victory to al-Shabaab and ISIS-Somalia in Somalia and neighboring countries.” It says the desired end state of the operation “is one in which terrorist organizations are not able to threaten the U.S. homeland, U.S. persons, international allies or destabilize the region.” Yet those objectives are virtually impossible to attain.

In July 2017, I traveled through a large section of Uganda where the terrorist Kony once called home to his Lord’s Resistance Army. Just two months earlier, Washington and Kampala had formally ceased trying to capture Kony.

The United States had been trying, since 2011, to kill or capture Kony, spending $800 million in the process. During my time there, Ugandan guides took me through the heart of the area where Kony had successfully eluded all efforts to capture him. It was clear why.

The jungles in parts of Africa are dense, have few paved roads, and many areas have no means of communication. In Kenya and Somalia, where al-Shabaab primarily operates, there are large expanses of deserts, mountains, and inhospitable brush country. There are reportedly up to 10,000 members of al-Shabaab, who have proven adept at hiding from authorities. In populated areas, it is virtually impossible to distinguish Somali civilians from al-Shabaab fighters.

Just like we failed to ever find Kony in Uganda, the mission to “degrade” al-Shabaab in east Africa is likewise suffering the same predictable failure. It is time to admit the reality in Somalia—as we did in Uganda in 2017—and end the mission. There is no utility in shuffling our troops to other parts of Africa, as is currently being planned. We need to end the pointless missions and end the fighting, withdrawing our troops back to the United States.

America’s best defense against terror threats—regardless of where in the world they originate—remains our robust global intelligence and strike capacity. Small numbers of troops fighting in the vast African continent will never succeed and will have their lives risked for a mission disconnected from U.S. security. This mission will continue to waste hundreds of millions of dollars and periodically cost the lives of our service members. It is time to acknowledge reality and end these conflicts.

The Latest Cyber Attack Exposed What A Dangerous Mess DOE Is,"As the post-mortem on the SolarWinds cyber-attack proceeds apace, the standard finger–pointing and recriminations are underway right on schedule. Much of the initial press attention focused on the targeting of the Department of Energy’s nuclear weapons division.

Public information is flimsy, of course, and further speculation is of limited value. But the attack does shine the spotlight on a highly unusual federal organization.

In the late 1990s, the Department of Energy found itself beset by a massive security breach at Los Alamos, one of its prestigious weapons labs. A multi-voluminous report resulting from a bipartisan congressional investigation concluded: “The People’s Republic of China has stolen design information on the United States’s most advanced thermonuclear weapons.” President Bill Clinton’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board reached a similar conclusion: “The Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven it is incapable of reforming itself.”

The solution was to establish the National Nuclear Security Administration, a new “semi-autonomous” agency within the Department of Energy that would take over all of the DOE’s nuclear weapons-related functions and impose stricter security protocols. The civilian half of the department, meanwhile, could focus on “energy” proper.

It was to be a classic, textbook case of comparative advantage and specialization. Well, at least in theory.

In practice, however, the Department of Energy is essentially the Los Angeles of bureaucratic sprawl. There are 17 national laboratories, each with its own lab director. The DOE maintains sites in Nevada, Kentucky, Tennessee, South Carolina, Washington, New Mexico, and Kansas City. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission — statutorily independent — also falls under the DOE umbrella, as does the Energy Information Administration and the four Power Marketing Administrations.

And then, there’s the NNSA. To begin with, it’s important to note that “semi-autonomous” is an inherently nebulous term. In essence, the NNSA does its own thing, which can get it into trouble. Furthermore, while it does officially report to the Department of Defense, it doesn’t seem to like it very much.

Further complicating matters is the Naval Reactors division within NNSA. “NR,” as it is known, handles the propulsion program that powers submarines and aircraft carriers. The law states that the head of NR reports “through” the NNSA administrator to the Secretary of Energy, to whom he or she has “direct access,” but also explicitly states the NNSA administrator has no authority over Naval Reactors, which also reports to the Navy.

In other words, the DOE consists of dozens of little and not-so-little civilian entities and a giant quasi-military branch, which operates “semi-autonomously” from it but also reports to another cabinet department – except for one critical program, which operates on its own but also reports to another department. Clear as mud.

The truth is that DOE’s grotesque organizational chart is hopelessly crisscrossed with solid lines, dotted lines, and wavy curves. Its antiquated IT systems are an open joke, from chitchat in the cafeteria to snickering in the executive suites as conference calls and video sessions fail to launch.

One explanation for its dysfunction? With so many people in charge, conceivably nobody is.

Irony abounds. In 2018, then-Secretary Rick Perry established the DOE’s Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response. Its first assistant secretary, Karen Evans, was replaced in February 2020 without explanation. Her successor was then replaced in November. A bold idea consumed by political infighting.

Additionally, there are unique challenges posed by the National Laboratories. While they are all government-owned, all but one is contractor-operated. They see themselves as universities subject to academic freedom and open to international collaboration.

Laudable efforts by the Trump administration to tighten issues concerning foreign nationals have met resistance. Increasingly, labs are also conducting work for non-government entities, even as the DOE’s conflict of interest policy could certainly use some work.

With such high stakes and important material under its purview, the Department of Energy should be far more than a travel agency for senior appointees with security clearances. Yet the cumbersome structure of the department lends itself to bureaucratic food fights and petty feudalism. Unfortunately, it will likely take more than a mere crisis to fix it.

Multiple Catastrophes Strike On The Latest Episode Of ‘The Expanse’,"Warning: spoilers ahead for episode four of season five of “The Expanse”

The end of the previous episode of “The Expanse” left many viewers with their jaws agape, watching Earth struck by the first of many stealth-cloaked asteroids flung at the planet by rogue OPA terrorist Marco Inaros. Episode four of the fifth season will leave most viewers with mouths open and hearts racing for the entire runtime.

Marco’s sinister attack goes undetected by Earth’s Sentinel asteroid monitors and lands near Dakar, Senegal (not South Africa, as previously thought). Complicating matters is that former U.N. Secretary-General Chrisjen Avasarala suspected such an attack was possible, even imminent, but was rebuffed by Admiral Felix Delgado, the only high-ranking military officer on Earth with whom she still holds a small, remaining degree of influence.

Earth’s only answer to Martian stealth tech is its Watchtower defense system — a network of advanced spy satellites Avasarala argued, in episode three, should be turned away from Mars and used to thwart what she suspects of Marco. This insistent appeal to Admiral Delgado is shot down. Whether Delgado and Avasarala could have averted disaster had Delgado listened and they found sympathetic ears at U.N. high command is unknowable, which makes the catastrophes to come sting all the more.

Crippled By Old Fears

At fault is the simple fact that too many of Earth’s politicians are still fighting the last war. In reality, the dream — and threat — of Mars is almost completely dead. Yet even as citizens of Mars flee to new worlds beyond the ring gates at breakneck speed, Earth’s leadership remains intransigently embroiled in a crippling fear and hatred of the Martian Congressional Republic, their longtime arch-rival.

While it’s frustrating to watch such failures of those placed in positions of responsibility and authority over so many, it’s a pattern that has been repeated throughout our own timeline. Old inter-generational hatreds and grievances die hard, and far too frequently blind us to new emerging threats until, as in the case of Nancy Gao’s Earth, the hour is critically, irreversibly late.

In the open space between Mars and the Belt, Bobbie and Alex trail the Barkeith, an MCR supply ship Bobbie suspects of being a key to the black-market smuggling operation they’ve been investigating. To avoid raising any alarms from those who may recognize the famous racing ship, Alex changes the Razorback’s name to The Screaming Firehawk, fulfilling one of his longstanding ambitions to name a ship.

The duo discusses their situation and how it could be possible that so many ostensibly patriotic Martians may be involved in such a dastardly scheme. When Alex questions how Bobbie is so calm and collected instead of outraged, she tells Alex she’s essentially made her peace with the fact the Mars she used to love is likely gone forever.

“So we’re building a coffin for our dying planet?” Alex asks Bobbie. “I went through the exact same thing you’re going through right now,” she responds, “and when you come out the other side of this, you’re gonna wanna be doing something that matters.”

Moments later, an emergency flight restriction from the U.N. flashes on-screen, advising Alex to expect delays if attempting to land on Earth. Investigating further and turning to breaking news broadcasts, Alex and Bobbie learn of the first asteroid to hit Earth. And that’s not all — an explosion has apparently rocked the Martian Parliament as well.

Second Chances

A beautiful sweeping shot over the Chesapeake Conservation Zone in northern Virginia centers on a severe and foreboding U.N. penitentiary known as “The Pit.” Inside, Amos uses his V.I.P. status granted by Avasarala to gain access to the lower levels, where the prison’s most dangerous inmates are housed — men and women with cybernetic body modifications. He’s granted access to the cell of Clarissa Mao, serving a life sentence for blowing up a U.N. fleet support ship in season three.

Since season four, it’s been known Mao uses her single granted monthly video call to talk to Amos. Now, Amos has shown up in person. When Amos informs her that he’s here to help, Mao informs him that “not every stain comes out.”

Then, similar to how Alex and Bobbie had their heart-to-heart interrupted, alarms blare in The Pit, and a low rumbling sound rolls into a crescendo. The lights go out. A second asteroid has struck near their location. Buried multiple floors underground, they should be safe — that is, after they make it past the dozens of mod-enhanced murderers that have been so perfectly placed in their way. If there’s a video-game-style moment Amos Burton was made for, it’s this. Next week’s episode should be quite the horror-filled ride watching them escape.

On Luna, Avasarala frantically attempts to reach anyone at Fleet Command who will listen to her dire warning that the asteroid that struck Africa was an attack. She’s interrupted by Delgado, who brings her the news of the second asteroid strike, making impact 40 kilometers northwest of Philadelphia. “At least now,” he says mournfully, “they’ll know it was an attack.”

Blackballed by most of the U.N. senior administration officials, the two struggle to reach Secretary-General Gao aboard U.N. One, until Avasarala craftily uses her former chef (Casey) to bring a tray bearing an open window of her video feed. The plan works, and Gao listens to Avasarala.

In this grave moment, Gao puts aside her ego and her entire political history and wants to hear all the expertise she can get, immediately acting on Avasarala’s recommendation to link the Watchtower satellites to Earth’s orbital spotters. It’s a Sorkinesque moment of statesmanship and humility for a character who was hard to like and often came off smug and petulant.

Unfortunately, the moment doesn’t last long. A third asteroid hits South Asia, creating a massive shockwave in the atmosphere surrounding Gao’s plane, which is torn in two.

‘Something Is Wrong’

On Tycho Station, James Holden, Fred Johnson, and Chief Security Officer Carlos c de Baca (a.k.a. “Bull”) race to set up a trap for the still unknown entities who appear to be aware Johnson has another sample of protomolecule and want to steal it for their own purposes. Unfortunately, they’re about to fall into a trap of their own.

Noticing irregularities with the Zmeya, the ship expected to dock with Bull’s container, Holden exclaims, “something is wrong.” Then, all hell breaks loose on Tycho.

The Zmeya fires upon the container ship just as Holden tells Bull to get out of the area. Sakai, Tycho Station’s bubbly and sweet chief engineer, shoots Johnson three times in the back, flees, and spikes Tycho’s entire communications network.

OPA terrorists from Marco’s faction spring their trap. Gunfire erupts. A second rocket lands in Johnson’s private quarters, where Monica Stuart was being held for her safety. A scavenger robot has landed with one objective: find and retrieve Johnson’s sample of protomolecule for Marco Inaros.

Holden races to the scene and arrives just as Monica struggles with Sakai and the bot attempts to leave with the protomolecule. Faced with the choice between saving Monica and stopping the protomolecule sample from landing into the wrong hands — with the potential to kill billions — he chooses the latter, but fails.

As loyal Tycho security forces restore order on the station, it’s revealed that the great Fred Johnson has died from his wounds. “He deserved to finish what he was building,” Holden remarks as he stares at a wounded and distraught Bull. One can’t help thinking that when Drummer finds out that Marco is now responsible for the death of Johnson and Ashford, she will make it her life’s mission to bring him down.

Back on Luna, we find out tsunamis caused by the asteroid that struck the east coast has caused the failure of the seawalls protecting New York City, preventing contact with the U.N. Headquarters. No one is sure who is in charge on Earth according to the line of succession.

Yet, in one of the few signs of hope in the episode, we see a fourth asteroid disintegrated by Earth’s defenses before further harm can be caused. Gao’s order to reposition the Watchtowers went out in time, saving innumerable lives.

A Common Foe

The episode ends with Naomi being brought to Marco’s ship, where the OPA terrorist gives a victory speech, declaring his own version of the Monroe Doctrine and claiming the right to the ring gates and all that lies beyond for the Belt.

For a show with many excellent episodes of television to its name, episode four, “Gaugamela” ranks among its best — heart-pounding, gripping, emotional, and filled with great performances from top to bottom.

The title of the episode cleverly references Alexander the Great’s historic and decisive victory over the Persian Achaemenid Empire in 331 BC. The parallels here are striking and go far beyond the fact that Marco’s ship is named Pella (the capital of ancient Macedonia and the birthplace of Alexander).

Alexander’s Macedonia, like Marco’s OPA faction, is a power seemingly on the rise and commanded by a young, charismatic leader. Outnumbered, he manages to score a major victory over a waning, formerly great power through tactical cunning and the overconfidence of his opponents. Yet, like Alexander, Marco’s own arrogance and overextension may well have laid the seeds of his undoing. Earth and Mars now have a common foe.

Devin Nunes Tells The Truth Until It Hurts,"In early December 2016, Devin Nunes was growing suspicious.

The political and media establishment, still struggling to cope with the news of Donald Trump’s victory, was beginning to claim that Russian cyber meddling explained the surprising outcome. On Dec. 9, 2016, big media outlets such as the New York Times and Washington Post began laying out the contours of what would become the dominant and relentless media narrative of the next several years: Trump had conspired with Russia to steal the election and should not be viewed or treated as a legitimate president.

Nunes, the Republican chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), was a long-time Russia hawk who had spent years concerned about the United States’ lack of preparedness for Russian cyberattacks. But something didn’t sit right about the how the media and other activists were arriving at the narrative.

For one thing, the claims were significantly at odds with the official reports from the intelligence agencies his committee oversaw. For another, the press reports were fed solely by dubiously selective and anonymous leaks from intelligence officials.

“I am deeply concerned that these press reports may contain unauthorized disclosures,” Nunes wrote on Dec. 12, 2016, to President Barack Obama’s Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, instructing him to have intelligence agencies send to Congress any new assessments that had been reported in the press. He expressed concern about the “manipulation of intelligence for political purposes” two days later. By December 16, having received none of the new assessments that anonymous leakers to the press claimed existed, he vowed to vigorously investigate intelligence agencies’ handling of the Russian meddling issue.

He had no idea at the time, but Nunes’s early skepticism of the “Russia collusion” plan to undermine the Trump administration put him in the crosshairs of all of the most powerful forces in Washington, including the media, the Democrat Party, left-wing special interest groups, intelligence agency officials, and even many Republicans.

Nunes’s dogged pursuit of the truth paid off, eventually, but it wasn’t easy. The “Russia collusion” narrative caused untold damage to the Trump administration and its policy goals. It sparked a years-long special counsel probe that pursued scores of Trump associates but found none who had colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election. Journalists won Pulitzers and other prizes for perpetuating the false narrative. Even now, many Democrats still cling to claims of Trump being controlled by Vladimir Putin.

However, Nunes overcame the media and Democrat hysteria, as well as stonewalling and obstruction by the FBI and Justice Department (DOJ), including threats to his own staff, to uncover the FBI’s use of an unverified dossier of outlandish allegations in the warrants to spy on Carter Page, a Trump campaign associate. He revealed rampant “unmasking” by Obama officials against Trump transition members, and the fact that FBI agents who interviewed Trump’s first National Security Advisor Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn didn’t think he was lying.

He waged a court battle with the inventors of the dossier to find out that their work was secretly funded by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee. And he revealed how that group employed Nellie Ohr, the wife of DOJ official Bruce Ohr, who was used to funnel questionable anti-Trump information to the FBI from his wife and her associates.

He also overcame the concerted efforts to destroy him and his reputation, remove him from committee leadership, prevent his re-election, and to get him to pull back from his work through threats against family members.

Later today he is expected to be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States.

Water, Water, Water

That Nunes would have the fortitude to take on the political and media establishments was not completely obvious when he was first elected to Congress in 2002. He was all of 29, representing a congressional district in the San Joaquin Valley in Central California, where he grew up. From a family of dairy farmers — a point that a critic on MSNBC would later use to dismiss him as ignorant — Nunes was known for his fierce advocacy of his constituents’ interest.

He set up his offices to quickly respond to constituent questions, reminding staff that they were the last line of hope for many of the California residents writing and calling them, and that they were to do what it took to solve their problems related to government services. One former staff member said that the “number one, two, three, four, and five” issues they worked on were “water.”

A lot of that effort was due to environmentalists imposing a catastrophic and artificial drought on many Central Valley farmers in the name of protecting a fish called the Delta Smelt. Nunes pushed that story relentlessly until he achieved national awareness of the plight of farmers, getting members to vote publicly on the matter, hosting rallies, and talking about the absurdity of the regulations destroying California farms.

Water policy in agricultural areas is always a hot-button and complicated topic. Hill aides say that many politicians like to complicate topics so people get lost in the intricacies. Nunes, they said, liked to simplify things so everyone could grasp the problem and solve it. He showed he was willing to buck party interests in his quest to serve constituents, calling on California’s Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to resign when he wasn’t allowing water to flow to the Central Valley.

Nunes, who also serves on the Ways and Means Committee, was appointed to the Intelligence Committee in 2011. He became chairman in 2015. The committee was an important, but relatively quiet, one. It investigated the Benghazi disaster, and worked to declassify some of the documents seized in the raid on Osama Bin Laden’s compound.

Once chairman, Nunes worked with ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff, also of California, to pass the annual funding authorization for the intelligence community. Nunes worked with leadership to recruit and retain a team of hard-working members who were interested in doing oversight and not just having a title.

As the Russia narrative spiraled out of control, Nunes continued to express skepticism. After Flynn’s phone calls with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak were leaked, Nunes told Bloomberg columnist Eli Lake, “There does appear to be a well orchestrated effort to attack Flynn and others in the administration,” he said. “From the leaking of phone calls between the president and foreign leaders to what appears to be high-level FISA Court information, to the leaking of American citizens being denied security clearances, it looks like a pattern.”

The Mask Drops

Russia hoaxers had managed to get Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from any oversight of the probe. They continued to leak like sieves against the president. Anonymous intelligence officials falsely claimed to credulous reporters that the ludicrous “dossier” was being verified, although details and substantiation were always just around the corner.

In March 2017, Nunes revealed that in the last three months of the Obama presidency, significant personal information from and about the Trump transition was collected and widely disseminated at intelligence agencies. While he said the collection of information may have been legally collected under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), he was “alarmed” by it. In a free country, where watchdogs care about threats to privacy from government surveillance, this would have been a massive story.

Instead of covering the news, the political and media establishment worked to kill the story. Rather than focus in any way on the spying, they claimed to be upset that Nunes didn’t first brief his leaky and highly partisan colleague Schiff before holding a press conference. As for the substance of the claims, the media worked to avoid covering it in any detail.

PBS’ Judy Woodruff asked Obama National Security Advisor Susan Rice a gentle, very general question about Nunes’s claims:

JUDY WOODRUFF: I began by asking about the allegations leveled today by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes that Trump transition officials, including the president, may have been swept up in surveillance of foreigners at the end of the Obama administration. SUSAN RICE: I know nothing about this. I was surprised to see reports from Chairman Nunes on that count today.

It turns out that Rice was completely lying on national television. After word got out that Rice had, in fact, been one of the people to “unmask” transition officials who had been swept up in surveillance, she went to the Democratic journalist Andrea Mitchell for a damage control interview. Rice, who has a reputation for dishonesty, told Mitchell that her unmaskings weren’t “political” and added, somewhat confusingly, “I leaked nothing to nobody.”

It is interesting, though, that the meeting she unmasked — between Trump officials and the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates — did happen to leak to the Washington Post.

It wasn’t just Rice. Samantha Power unmasked nearly 300 Americans in 2016, despite U.S. ambassadors having little if any legitimate justification for unmasking. She claimed that the unmaskings done in her name were actually done by other, unknown people.

And a whopping 39 Obama officials unmasked Flynn, a frequent victim of leaked communications. Among the unmaskers were officials with little legitimate need to access this kind of intelligence. They include former Vice President Joe Biden, Power, and Obama’s Chief of Staff Dennis McDonough.

The media response to the entire Russia collusion hoax was so manic and horrifically corrupt that it marked a turning point in Nunes’s engagement with them. He began to see that many members of the media weren’t journalists, but liars, and treated them accordingly. He instructed staff to stop responding to dishonest reporters who had pre-written their stories before contacting him.

Many members of Congress are scared of the media and other powerful interests. If they get attacked by them, they back down. Staff say that’s where Nunes is different. If he gets punched by someone, he wonders why and starts looking for answers. The more that he was attacked, the more he wanted to understand what was behind the Russia collusion narrative.

His opponents couldn’t have been more wrong in how to contain him.

FISA Abuse Memo

The media frenzy and coordinated opposition to Nunes led to claims that he had to recuse himself from leading the investigation into Russian collusion. Three left-wing groups filed an ethics complaint that Nunes’s mentioning of the unmasking constituted mishandling classified information. The claim was picked up by the Ethics Committee. While they eventually dismissed the complaint, they publicly announced the investigation and took the better part of the year to investigate it.

Nunes did recuse himself from leading the probe into Russian meddling, instead focusing on abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) process during the surveillance of Trump campaign affiliates. The task was made significantly difficult by the DOJ’s general refusal to comply or comply fully with information requests on the surveillance.

The memo broke the news that the “Steele dossier” formed an essential part of the application to spy on Trump affiliate Carter Page, and that the warrant failed to note that Clinton and the DNC funded the dossier. It showed that Steele should have been fired as a source for blabbing to the press before he was eventually fired for the same reason.

It showed that information from Steele continued to be funneled to the FBI through a DOJ official married to someone else working on the larger dossier project, and that the negative information he provided the FBI about Steele’s lack of credibility was kept away from the FISA Court. Ohr, the DOJ official, also funneled to the Bureau his wife’s work for opposition research firm Fusion GPS.

All of these relationships were kept concealed from the FISA Court. Nunes’s memo revealed that the dossier had not been even close to verified when it was used in the application.

All of these things are now common knowledge and have been reported via other means, such as the DOJ’s inspector general, declassification of underlying documents, and a few media investigations. But at the time they were published, they seriously undercut the Russia collusion narrative and provoked strenuous denunciation of Nunes.

The Department of Justice said that release of memo would be “extraordinarily reckless,” would be “damaging” to “national security,” and would risk “damage to our intelligence community or the important work it does in safeguarding the American people.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said it was a “gift to Putin.”

When the report was released, the media made a variety of contradictory claims, all of them downplaying or dismissing the memo as nothing whatsoever. “Why Were The Democrats So Worried About The Nunes Memo?” asked The New Yorker. Rachel Maddow said that, far from destroying national security, instead the memo delivered “a sad trombone for Trump.” “It’s a joke and a sham,” claimed Washington Post writers.

“The memo purports to show that the process by which the FBI and Justice Department obtained approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to conduct surveillance on former Trump adviser Carter Page was deeply tainted,” the Post article says. “It does this by straining every which way to suggest that the basis for the warrant was the so-called ‘Steele dossier,’ which contains Democratic-funded research by former British spy Christopher Steele.” (The inspector general later confirmed that efforts to secure a warrant to spy on Page were dropped due to lack of evidence until Steele delivered his dossier memos.)

On the other hand, Salon called the memo “fake news.” New York Magazine’s Jonathan Chait, who fervently believes that Trump is a traitor who colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election, all evidence to the contrary, went even further. “The Nunes Memo Is Fake and the Russia Scandal Is Very Real,” he claimed. “While the evidence that the DOJ has been corrupt or even sloppy in its investigation has disintegrated, evidence for the seriousness of the investigation itself has grown progressively stronger,” Chait claimed.

CNN had their good buddy James Clapper, a famously untruthful Obama intelligence chief, on to say that the memo was a “blatant political act.” John Brennan, Obama’s mendacious CIA chief who was also implicated in the spying on the Trump campaign, told Politico that the memo was “exceptionally partisan.” Politico claimed the memo “makes no sense.”

“Nunes Memo Accidentally Confirms the Legitimacy of the FBI’s Investigation,” asserted The Intercept. “All Smoke, No Fire,” claimed resistance member Orin Kerr in The New York Times. “The Nunes Memo Continues To Backfire,” declared the hyperpartisan Washington Post editorial board.

Schiff issued a response memo in which he claimed that everything was above reproach in the FISA process. “Nail in the Coffin for Nunes Memo,” declared the headline of a U.S. News and World Report article that effusively praised Schiff.

“Nunes’ memo was a bad joke from the start,” the author wrote, going on to assert that Page was a dangerous agent of Russia, multiple Trump campaign operatives were surveilled for excellent reason, and the ex-British spy secretly Clinton hired to produce the dossier alleging Trump was a secret agent of Russia was simply beyond reproach.

An inspector general report later vindicated Nunes’s memo and discredited each of the claims in Schiff’s memo. Schiff claimed he was “unaware” of the problems the IG found and continues to defend the FBI investigation even now. He has not held a single hearing on the IG report, nor on the conviction of FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith for doctoring evidence for use in a Page spy warrant.

Few Friends

The daily onslaught of Russia collusion stories made life difficult for anyone who stood against the tide. The media were in a constant state of hysteria. Nunes stood mostly alone in insisting there was no evidence Trump had colluded with Russia, but there were strong indications the FBI’s investigation of the issue had been corrupted. It wasn’t just Democrats, media operatives, and leftwing groups who were attacking him but even fellow Republicans.

Sen. Lindsay Graham frequently appeared on television in the last year to complain about the Russia collusion hoax. He even held a couple of hearings in the fall of 2020 — long after it mattered. But back in 2017, Graham went on NBC News to mock Nunes, saying he was running “an Inspector Clouseau investigation.” Republican Rep. Walter Jones called on Nunes to resign from the committee leadership.

National Review’s David French called on Nunes to resign his post, and went on left-wing MSNBC to promote his view that Nunes lacked “integrity, character, and — crucially — competence,” saying it was “time” for Nunes to go. French claimed that Trump voters in his area of Tennessee were extremely worried about Trump’s ties to Russia and would need someone with better traits to dig into the matter.

It was a vicious claim against a member known as a straight shooter. The attacks were difficult for Nunes and his staff. For decades, he had taught his staff that they should always be honest when dealing with constituents, that they should “tell the truth until it hurts.” Constituents may not like the congressman’s position, but they would know what his true position was. “As far as Devin as a politician, ‘straight shooter’ is a little on the nose,” said one former top aide.

MSNBC’s John Heilemann repeatedly suggested Nunes was “compromised by the Russians:”

‘[Nunes is] behaving like someone who’s been compromised, and there are people in the intelligence community, and others with great expertise in this area, who look at him and say, ‘That guy’s been compromised,” Heilemann told [Senator Chris] Murphy.

Heilemann did not note that Nunes has a lengthy reputation as a Russia hawk, having warned that Russian activity was the country’s “biggest intelligence failure since 9/11” and having stridently advocated for a stronger U.S. approach to Putin.

Shep Smith called Nunes’s memo a “weapon of partisan mass distraction, especially at a pivotal moment in American democracy when it behooves the man in charge for supporters to believe the institutions can’t be trusted, the investigators are corrupt and the news media are liars. Context matters.”

As Nunes’s influence grew, he was subject to constant media attacks, including tendentious “profiles” that were error-filled hit pieces. Reporters went after his family. Nunes’ wife received threats after a Democratic operative files a public records request against her to get her work emails (she’s a public school teacher), then published them on the Internet. Then leftwing group Campaign for Accountability cited the emails in an ethics complaint against Devin.

Esquire’s Ryan Lizza published a lengthy story alleging that Nunes had a “politically explosive secret,” that he’s a hypocrite on immigration policy, and that when Lizza went to a small town in Iowa to blow open the conspiracy, he was met by odd townspeople who treated him poorly. It turned out that Nunes didn’t have a secret, that he was not a hypocrite on immigration policy, and that the Iowans Lizza met were wary of him slowly driving around town while children were at play because they discovered Lizza had recently been fired from his job for sexual misconduct.

A Top Political Target for Years

Nunes became a top target of the Democrats, left-wing groups, and the media because they could see early on he’d be a problem for their Russia collusion narrative. His seat even became a top Democratic target in 2018. Nunes had enjoyed comfortable leads in his previous re-election campaigns, even if he treated each race as a serious contest. In 2016, he won with 68 percent of the vote.

In 2018, his opponent was a relative unknown, a prosecutor with no political background who had moved into the district. Thanks to a massive, coordinated nationwide effort from leftwing groups, Andrew Janz raised more than $9 million and gave Nunes the closest race he’d had in a long while. The race earned national attention from the media and other activist groups.

Leftist groups astroturfed regular protests filled with angry people from outside the district posing as constituents at Nunes’s field offices. They overwhelmed his robust constituent service operation with angry calls from across the country. Much of it was Russia focused.

At one point, Janz had an actor pose as a Russian official to give Nunes a “key to Moscow.” Fusion GPS, the group that had been behind the Steele dossier, even admitted that Nunes was the only member of Congress on whom they ran an oppo hit during the 2018 campaign. They gave their information to a McClatchy newspaper and tried, but failed, to link Nunes to a dramatic story involving a separate group of people having a cocaine-fueled fundraiser on a yacht owned by a winery he was loosely associated with.

Targeted in D.C. by media mobs and in his home district by a major coordinated effort to oust him, he kept going. At a time when anybody in D.C. who fought the Russia collusion hoax was hammered and attacked, Nunes went out and pushed for the truth. He did it willingly and refused to quit. He also refused to give in to his many attackers, despite their relentless barrage.

When the White House leaked to the Washington Post about their plans to award Nunes and Rep. Jim Jordan the presidential medal of freedom, the media and political figures who pushed the Russia collusion hoax continued their attacks on him, the same attacks they’d been making for years in an attempt to keep him from uncovering abuses of the intelligence agencies he oversees.

It is unlikely their latest efforts will work any better than their earlier ones.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/01/04/devin-nunes-tells-the-truth-until-it-hurts/,2021-01-04
Wednesday's Riot Is No Pass For Republicans To Surrender,"During and in the immediate aftermath of Wednesday’s shameful attack on the U.S. Capitol building, Republicans and conservatives across the board voiced swift condemnation of the rioters. It was an attack on a sacred symbol of the American legislative branch, Americans were killed, and dozens more were badly injured. It was sad, it was frightening, it was lawless, and no party believed the guilty parties should escape swift justice.

Now, if 2020 memories can be stretched so far, compare this with the night of Aug. 27, when senators, congressman, government officials, volunteers, husbands, wives, and children exited the White House grounds. They had been celebrating the final night of the Republican National Convention, while outside in the darkness raging mobs stalked the streets waiting to attack.

I recall checking in that evening with friends and colleagues in the gardens. It was frightening, they’d said, hearing the chanting, drumming, and taunts surrounding the sacred seat of the American executive branch, and knowing they had to go into those mobs defenseless.

That night, footage showed Sen. Rand Paul and his wife fleeing while police defended them from violent attackers. An old man was punched in the head. One couple I spoke with escaped by following as closely as they could behind an official convoy, while others clung together while running for safety.

In the days after, we heard not a word about our sacred institutions, nor an utterance of insurrection, rebellion, or coup.

The corporate press has scurried to cover for this broad Democratic failure to speak up against left-wing political violence, piecing together scattered denouncements spread over months of rising mayhem. Meanwhile, corporate media glossed over noteworthy incidents like Vice President-elect Kamala Harris helping to raise money to indiscriminately bail out violent rioters, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler claiming Antifa is “a myth,” and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser gifting the White House rioters the base of operations they used to set up a mock guillotine and launch their White House attack.

But fine — here we are. Seven months after The Atlantic declared political riots “The American Way,” and six months after Democrats shot down a Senate resolution condemning mob violence, the left appears ready to finally seriously tackle the danger political violence poses to us all.

This sounds like a positive development for the entire country, but it unfortunately turns out their plan is the mass suppression of opposing speech, the weaponization of corporate donations, the destruction of the Republican Party’s tech infrastructure, the exile of prominent elected conservatives from the legislature, and a general “cleansing” of the GOP.

Over the past few days, we’ve seen Democrats and their corporate allies execute this plan. Social media sites, gun sites, and others have been unceremoniously deplatformed, the essential infrastructure of center-right tech has been shaken, countless independent voices have been silenced, and in addition to impeachment and disbarment, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee suggested adding Sens. Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley to a list of terrorists banned from flying. No evidence has yet been presented that any of the private companies deplatformed were involved in the riots, and the senators’ crime is simply demanding an election-fraud investigation, but no matter.

With a few brave exceptions, the Republican response to this onslaught has thus far been the equivalent of bringing notes of apology to their political hangings. Sens. Pat Toomey and Lisa Murkowski, for example, appear too focused on impeaching the outgoing president to defend their constituents’ constitutional rights.

Unsurprisingly, Democrats aren’t slowing their onslaught. Seeing their political opponents cowed, and further emboldened by impending control of both the legislative and executive branches of government, they’ve tacked even further left, with even fake-moderate West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin declining to rule out statehood for Puerto Rico or Washington, D.C.

With Democrats in control, Republicans are seriously short on options for the next two years. Working to force hard votes, fighting to hold up radical nominees, and bringing unrelenting pressure on the floor and in the media will have to suffice in a time the filibuster’s days are almost certainly numbered.

That doesn’t, however, mean it will not be essential to speak for the half of Americans who are about to lose their power in the federal government. Just two months ago, 74 million Americans — law-abiding, peaceful Americans — voted for President Donald Trump’s second term, and they do not disappear because it appears momentarily easy for Republicans to ignore them in the hope the left eats them last.

We are currently witnessing the biggest corporate-government power-grab in modern history. It’s an attack on our basic rights, it’s a chill on the myth of free competition in tech, it’s devastating to the minority party’s online outreach and fundraising, and it’s downright un-American.

What it is not is some magic wand to erase 74 million of us and call it “unity.” Despite these crackdowns, for now we still live in a two-party, minority-majority country. Now as much as ever, Republican lawmakers must recognize why — and fight for us all.

4 Reasons McConnell's Impeachment Blunder Is Doomed To Failure,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made a terrible mistake Tuesday night when he released word that he was in favor of impeaching President Donald Trump. This mistake goes well beyond a simple political miscalculation. It is the physical manifestation of Washington Republican hubris, wrapped in a fog of frightened groupthink.

Announced the eve of the House impeachment vote in the pages of The New York Times, McConnell’s plan reportedly rested on the belief that impeaching the outgoing president “will make it easier to purge Mr. Trump from the party.” Published just after the No. 3 House Republican, Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney, announced her intention to vote for impeachment, for a moment it appeared the still-Republican Senate might end up joining with the Democrats after all.

By early afternoon the following day, however, the situation on the ground had changed. By the time the sun set in Washington, only 10 of 195 House Republicans — or about 5 percent — had joined with Democrats. Meanwhile, conservative members of the House had begun whipping support for Cheney’s resignation from leadership; and nervous Republican senators were publicly turning against impeachment. Retreating, McConnell declared he no longer knew which way he would vote, and in a statement suggested the Senate might not be able to take up the trial on time after all.

And just like that, McConnell (and Cheney’s) plan to purge the party of the new populist right appears to have unraveled. So how did the worst laid plans of mice and Mitch go so quickly to pieces?

First, the rollout. House Republicans and most senators were caught completely off guard by McConnell’s reported change of heart. While it’s not wise to thumbtack plans to purge the party on the events bulletin board in the hall, Republicans are not accustomed to taking orders to march on their own voters from a newspaper that hates them all — and aren’t prepared to do so now.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, meanwhile, appears to have been caught by surprise by McConnell’s sneak attack, leaving him incapable of whipping House votes even if he’d had the time or inclination to do so. There’s no evidence he had either. Remember, the rank and file of Congress has changed: More than 40 percent of the D.C. GOP has been elected since Trump was the Republican nominee.

This alone didn’t mean that McConnell couldn’t lead impeachment proceedings against the president anyway: Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi already had the numbers to impeach Trump with only Democratic votes. It did, however, send a strong message to Republican senators that the move to knife the man who had just won more votes than any Republican in history was no unified front. And now, it was a vote against nearly 95 percent of their House colleagues.

Second, the plan. McConnell’s plan was a very, very stupid plan; the kind more typically floated by a Politico reporter whose only friends work for Pelosi than by a veteran senator with a reputation for strategically doing nothing in the face of Democratic pressure to make a move.

As Ben Domenech explained in Wednesday morning’s issue of The Transom, the plan here would seriously threaten to rip the party “apart while dramatically increasing the likelihood that Donald Trump forms a third party — something his supporters would overwhelmingly welcome.”

“Eleventh hour impeachment functionally,” he added, “is an act of condemnation less for the president and more for the two-thirds of Republicans who still support him. It tells them they were wrong to cheer and clap and knock on doors and wave flags and make signs and drive in parades. It tells them CNN was right all along.”

Winning message right there, guys. Good plan.

Third, the voters. Trump’s voters are still here. Sure, no longer 74 million of them, but a lot more than it takes to give the majority of DC’s GOP the Georgia treatment. And many of them remember the events of the last four years well.

In Washington, bad memories can fade mercifully fast. A number of people I spoke with Tuesday night hadn’t thought of the leftwing mob’s August attack on the White House in months despite having been there, for example, until a Federalist article that morning drew out that fearful night like some kind of repressed memory therapy.

“Oh yeah,” some thought: “The attack on the Capitol is not the first time a politically goaded mob had violently attacked a sacred symbol of the republic — even if it is the first time CNN has cared.”

A lot of voters, however, did not bury the memory. Americans have been forced to suffer fringe left-wing violence since before Trump even won the nomination. This Inauguration Day will mark the four-year anniversary of Washington riots that left cars burning in the streets. What’s novel here is the reaction of America’s elites, which brings us to the final point.

The left. Since last week’s disgusting attack on the American Capitol, the titans of tech have decided to disenfranchise 74 million American Trump supporters. Not content with merely cancelling Instagram and Twitter accounts, they’ve targeted online payment systems and the very existence of websites they deem objectionable on little-to-no actual evidence of wrongdoing.

We’re beyond censorship now, folks. There’s a new system coming to big cities and small towns alike — and there’s no room for conservatives in it. Why, exactly, is this happening after years of tolerated and often celebrated political violence? Because this time, the mob wore red hats.

Amid this incredible assault on basic freedoms, McConnell and Co. hatched a plan: He would tell The New York Times to announce the Republican impeachment of President Donald Trump. It was not a very good plan, but there will be others. The populist right is still alive and well, and that, the likes of Cheney and McConnell cannot abide.

I Saw Provocateurs At The Capitol Riot On Jan. 6,"The deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol bore the markings of an organized operation planned well in advance of the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress.

A small number of cadre appeared to use the cover of a huge rally to stage its attack. Before it began, I saw from my vantage point on the West Front of the Capitol what appeared to be four separate cells or units:

Plainclothes militants. Militant, aggressive men in Donald Trump and MAGA gear at a front police line at the base of the temporary presidential inaugural platform; Agents-provocateurs. Scattered groups of men exhorting the marchers to gather closely and tightly toward the center of the outside of the Capitol building and prevent them from leaving; Fake Trump protesters. A few young men wearing Trump or MAGA hats backwards and who did not fit in with the rest of the crowd in terms of their actions and demeanor, whom I presumed to be Antifa or other leftist agitators; and Disciplined, uniformed column of attackers. A column of organized, disciplined men, wearing similar but not identical camouflage uniforms and black gear, some with helmets and GoPro cameras or wearing subdued Punisher skull patches.

All of these cells or groups stood out from the very large crowd by their behavior and overall demeanor. However, they did not all appear at the same time. Not until the very end did it appear there was a prearranged plan to storm the Capitol building, and to manipulate the unsuspecting crowd as cover and as a follow-on force.

Eyewitness Account, with No Outside Details

This article is a first-person, eyewitness account drafted the night of Jan. 6 and morning of Jan. 7, so it is not affected by other news coverage or information. The only research aids used in this article were photos and videos that I took from my phone.

I have witnessed and participated in scores of protests since the 1970s when as a high school student I was trained by professional agitators from California. Apart from my professional background and experience, nothing in this article is derived from any third-party information or analysis.

In editing this for publication, I fought the temptation to add new information that I had subsequently learned from my own or from other people’s accounts. Other reports will vary and may contain contradicting information, and will contain far more facts than appear here. Many well-known actions and developments reported in the news do not appear here, as this is purely what I saw and understood between about 11:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. on Jan. 6.

Anti-riot Police Prepared Early, But Presence Was Light

Originally I had planned not to attend any of the several pro-Trump events scheduled for that day. At the last minute, a companion and I decided to see what we could see. Late that morning, at about 11:30, I walked from near Union Station to the Senate side of Capitol Hill on 2nd and D Streets NW and noticed a small number of Capitol Police dressed in full riot gear, with shin guards and shoulder guards. One carried a black baton with side handle.

“That’s old school,” I called to the officer, giving him a thumbs-up. The police appeared to be readying to board a van or bus, although the Capitol was only 2-1/2 blocks away.

I crossed behind the Russell Senate Office Building to Constitution Avenue near the Capitol, past some out-of-towners who pointed at the Capitol and asked if it was the White House, then walked for about 25 minutes up Pennsylvania Avenue toward an empty Freedom Park.

A rally had just taken place there and moved to the Ellipse, the large lawn between the White House and Constitution Avenue NW. President Trump was speaking to a huge crowd at the Ellipse, although the Freedom Park rally had broken up to assemble at the Capitol before we arrived.

For such a massive event, police presence was light. District of Columbia police and a small group of DC National Guard had a relaxed demeanor, keeping a professional distance from marchers and other pedestrians, as they usually do. A few police and National Guard gathered around a mobile device to listen to the president make what sounded like rousing comments.

Crowd Energized and Festive, Not Angry or Incited

A while later we saw from a block away that marchers had begun down Constitution Avenue from the Ellipse to Capitol Hill, mostly along Constitution Avenue. We passed down 13th Street to join them.

Although the march was in protest of fraud in the 2020 election and people were recounting the president’s energizing speech, the mood of the crowd was positive and festive. Strangers stopped to talk to one another along the way, resisting but ultimately giving in to offers from street vendors hawking Trump and MAGA memorabilia, or to taking pictures of Washington landmarks.

Some along the way talked enthusiastically about President Trump joining them on Capitol Hill, as if he had said something about it in his Ellipse speech. I didn’t want to pop their balloon by saying that he undoubtedly would not. There was an expectation in the air that he would be there.

Of the thousands of people I passed or who passed me along Constitution Avenue, some were indignant and contemptuous of Congress, but not one appeared angry or incited to riot. Many of the marchers were families with small children; many were elderly, overweight, or just plain tired or frail—traits not typically attributed to the riot-prone.

Some said they were police officers from around the country. Many wore pro-police shirts or carried pro-police “Back the Blue” flags.

Diverse Cross-Section of America

Among the hundreds and hundreds of flags—perhaps thousands—displayed over the next few hours, I saw only two Confederate battle flags and one white supremacist sign, the latter of which some suspected aloud was a leftist plant. The two flags and one sign, I thought, would feature prominently in news reports to present a false image of the crowd.

A large group of African-American men sported shirts that said “Blacks for Trump.” Figuring that journalists would emphasize the solitary racist sign and Confederate flags, deliberately ignoring the rest, I took note of the fact that many demonstrators were black, Asian, and Latino, with a strong presence of Vietnamese- and Chinese-Americans.

Respect for the City and Streets

The DC government had placed only one portable toilet along the 16-block Constitution Avenue route, and five more near the intersection with Pennsylvania Avenue near the Canadian Embassy. The federal government opened the Ronald Reagan Building so people could use the bathrooms.

The city had provided few trash bins. (DC usually provides a large number of toilets and trash receptacles along march routes.) Yet remarkably little litter could be seen in the streets. People crushed their plastic water bottles and food wrappers and stuffed them in their pockets, and a few marchers picked up the occasional trash along the route.

Observations about the toilets and trash are noteworthy because, in my experience with and among large protest crowds in Washington, the large leftist crowds tend to be angry and leave trash in the streets and urine in the shrubs. None of that anger showed in the Jan. 6 crowd along Constitution Avenue.

The Exceptions: Organized Cadre

Although the crowd represented a broad cross-section of Americans, mostly working-class by their appearance and manner of speech, some people stood out. A very few didn’t share the jovial, friendly, earnest demeanor of the great majority. Some obviously didn’t fit in.

Among them were younger twentysomethings wearing new Trump or MAGA hats, often with the visor in the back, showing no enthusiasm and either looking at the ground, glowering, or holding out their phones with outstretched arms to make videos of as many faces as possible in the crowd.

Some appeared awkward, the way someone’s body language inadvertently shows the world that he feel like he doesn’t fit in. A few seemed to be nursing a deep, churning rage.

They generally covered their faces with cloth masks, as opposed to the pro-Trump people, few of whom wore masks at all. They walked, often hands in pockets, in clusters of perhaps four to six with at least one of them frequently looking behind.

These outliers group looked like trouble. I presumed these fake Trump protesters were Antifa or something similar. However, that entire afternoon I saw none of them act aggressively or cause any problems. At least, not from my vantage point.

A second outlier group also stood out. While many marchers wore military camouflage shirts, jackets, or pants of various patterns and states of wear and in all shapes and sizes, here and there one would see people of a different type: Wiry young men in good physical condition dressed neatly in what looked like newer camouflage uniforms with black gear, subdued patches including Punisher skulls, and helmets.

They showed tidiness and discipline. They strode instead of walked, moving at a more rapid pace than most of the people, sometimes breaking into a short jog, and generally keeping to the left side of Constitution Avenue in pairs of two or small groups of three. Unlike others in old military clothes who tended to be affable and talkative, these sullen men seemed not to speak to anyone at all. As we would see, they were the disciplined, uniformed column of attackers.

Entering the U.S. Capitol Grounds

We walked about three blocks behind the front of the march to the Capitol, with perhaps two or three thousand people ahead of us. The DC Metropolitan police were their usual professionally detached selves, standing on curbs or at street crossings and exchanging an occasional greeting from marchers, but treating the event as routine and at the lowest threat level.

When we crossed First Street NW to enter the Capitol grounds where the Capitol Police had jurisdiction, I noticed no police at all. Several marchers expressed surprise.

Passing by a few days earlier, I had noticed that, with presidential inaugural platform construction underway, the Capitol’s West Front lawn had been blocked off with plastic. On this day, there was no barrier blocking the paved footpath with its high granite curbs on either side leading up the Senate side of the hill. The openness seemed like a courtesy gesture from Congress, which controls security.

But that appearance of low threat level made no sense. American flags flew over the Senate and House chambers, indicating that each house of Congress was in session. Vice President Mike Pence was supposed to be there to certify the electoral votes. For better or worse, this was a historic day in Congress. Yet no Capitol Police appeared anywhere from what we could see, and I commented on to my companion that it was very strange for there to be no police during a joint session of Congress, with or without a gigantic crowd.

At a low point of ground, we crossed on top of what looked like a length of black aluminum fencing that had been placed flat over a wet area of mud or dead leaves in the walkway. It was the only thing out of place in what was becoming a funnel of people marching in from the broad merger of the six-lane Constitution Avenue and four-lane Pennsylvania Avenue and a Senate staff parking lot and park to the footpath. What looked like tens or even hundreds of thousands of people surged down the avenues as far as one could see.

At the West Front of the Capitol: Spirited Disorder

The marchers became denser as greater numbers of people funneled into the paved footpath going up Capitol Hill, but almost everyone seemed talkative and happy. The path was interrupted by a few steps and a handrail in the middle, going on until a second set of steps ended at a plaza at the Capitol’s crypt level.

The first thing we saw was the temporary news media tower built for cameras to transmit the upcoming presidential inauguration. As if at a party, some younger Trump supporters had climbed the tower and were waving American and political flags.

The tower stood before the painted wooden inaugural stand itself, with its VIP section above the balcony-like protrusion where Joe Biden will be sworn in as president. Windbreaks or something similar, made of metal scaffolding and covered with a façade of white cloth or plastic sheeting, rose above the north and south ends of the platform.

No police could be seen on the platform for now. No police could be seen anywhere.

People kept surging in from Constitution Avenue, and the plaza quickly filled up and overflowed onto the lawn. Everyone squeezed closer and closer together, with most in high spirits. Some trouble began up in the front, near the base of the inaugural platform itself, but we could not see what was happening.

Many of us looked on our phones for texts or Twitter messages to find out what was happening, but there was no functioning wireless service—too many people with phones in too small an area overloaded the cell phone transmission facilities.

The Capitol Police

The U.S. Capitol Police recruit a special kind of professional. They are sworn to defend one of the most important building complexes in the country, the U.S. Capitol and its sprawling congressional office buildings. More importantly, their mission is to defend one of the three coequal branches of the federal government, upholding the Constitution.

Every day they deal with thousands of tourists and visitors from around the country and the world. They have to be serious with their mission, but constantly show patience with the often frustrating and even annoying throngs of ordinary visitors and those who consider themselves Very Important People.

Normally, the Capitol Police are excellent at communicating with crowds. Not today.

A contingent of perhaps 30 to 50 Capitol Police emerged at the top of the inaugural platform above the VIP section and worked their way down to the spot where Biden will take his oath of office. It was after 1:17 p.m., according to my camera. They were armed with paintball-type long guns that fired capsules of pepper irritant, teargas launchers, and long guns that I could not identify from my position. Something was happening on the plaza level below them, but we couldn’t see.

To our left on the Senate side, a scuffle had already broken out, but we were so packed so tightly that we couldn’t see or hear. The biggest feature was the imposing edifice of the Capitol itself, the party-like guys up on the camera tower, and the endless crowd of people flowing in with colorful flags—American, MAGA, South Vietnamese, even one from Kazakhstan. Many eyes were on the Capitol police in their black tactical gear, bright yellow-green safety vests, and weapons.

Some out-of-towners wondered why the police were there when they were all pro-police and no Antifa were present. Others said they did see Antifa wearing backward MAGA hats, so the police must have been waiting for them. I quietly wondered why so few police were present for a crowd this or any size.

Confusion as Police Fire Tear Gas at Their Supporters

Then something happened at the front of the crowd, as if a champagne cork popped to release pent-up human energy. It seemed like a scuffle, but from 40 feet back, I couldn’t see. People started chanting “USA, USA,” and other slogans. Some burst with streams of profanity about Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and “the steal.”

For a few seconds I saw what looked like police in a tussle with some of the marchers up front—what appeared to be an organized group in civilian clothes. This organized group are the cell I call the “plainclothes militants.” They fit right in with the MAGA people.

Suddenly energy surged from the front of the crowd as the anti-riot police, above on the inaugural platform, visibly tensed up. Some sighted their pepper ball weapons toward the densely packed people. One fired a teargas canister—not at the plainclothes militants at the front line, but into the crowd itself. Then another. Flash grenades went off in the middle of the crowd.

I had seen anti-riot police in action before. They moved with a decisive sense of purpose. Now, the Capitol Police crew seemed confused, as if without a leader or perhaps inadequate rules of engagement. These professionals seemed directionless.

Some clambered up and down the inaugural platform steps. Others milled back and forth at the swearing-in level. Most of the police ended up leaving the surreal scene. Nobody could tell why.

Pro-Police People Felt Like They Were Being Attacked

No bullhorn or sound system could be heard for the police to communicate with the swelling mass of people.

The tear gas changed the crowd’s demeanor. There was an air of disbelief as people realized that the police whom they supported were firing on them. “What are you doing—we support you,” someone yelled. Tear gas wafted through the crowd, a low-grade irritant, fortunately, as if to send a warning to disperse. But nobody could disperse; some tried to leave the area, but more kept flowing in from Constitution Avenue, making evacuation impossible.

All of a sudden, pro-police people felt the police were attacking them, and they didn’t know why. Instead of running away, the people stood their ground.

Something seemed to break loose a second time toward the front, but we couldn’t tell what it was. Younger members of the crowd climbed the scaffolding inside the north façade of the inaugural platform and waved flags from the top. The crowd cheered.

More tear gas. A canister struck a girl in the face, drawing blood. The pro-police crowd went from disbelief and confusion to anger. A few dozen members of the crowd, mostly young men, raced up a narrow path on the stone steps behind the façade and a limestone wall, facing a few police at the top, who tried to stop them.

The police disappeared and a crowd surged up the stairs to the plaza at the Senate entry level. People inside the façade tore through to wave flags. As another canister of tear gas went off, a few people started pushing against the current of incoming marchers to leave the area.

Provocateurs to Turn Unsuspecting Marchers Into an Invading Mob

Then, a loud, bellowing shout from behind: “Forward! Do not retreat! Forward!”

Retreat? Nobody was retreating. They were trying to escape the tear gas. But the man kept yelling not to “retreat,” as if this were a military operation. In a powerful voice, he exhorted the crowd to remain on the plaza and not to disperse on the lawn or depart down the steps to the footpath. Thousands more people continued pouring in from Constitution Avenue.

Then two other men, standing across from one another on the high granite curbs on either side of the footpath, bellowed variations of “Forward! Don’t you dare retreat!” Some made direct eye contact at people and pointed directly at them, as if trying to psyche them into submitting.

Still more tear gas, this time with green or yellow smoke. I was concerned that my companion, who was recovering from a previously injured foot, might get knocked down if people started to stampede for air. Once someone falls down in a panicked crowd, there’s a dangerous risk of getting trampled to death. I opened the way for others to exit, with other marchers lending a hand. But most of the people stood where they were as more marchers flowed up Capitol Hill.

A third man standing on a chair, also shouting “Forward,” reached down to grab me by the shoulder and barked, “Don’t retreat! Get back up there!” It wasn’t an expression of enthusiasm or solidarity; it sounded like a military order. And it wasn’t from a wild kid; this guy was probably in his 50s. He looked furious with me.

What did he care what I did? What difference would the departure of ten or even a hundred of us make, with so many more surging in. The furious man crouched down and yelled in my face: “We’re going into the Capitol!” I ignored him, broke away, and worked my way down the steps.

“What a stupid idiot,” I thought. “You can’t just walk into the Capitol anymore. Especially not today.” Bystanders helped my companion and me mount the high stone curb to the grass, where we chatted with new people we met and wondered what was happening up front.

What the barking men were doing didn’t hit me until later, when we found out about the attack: They appeared to be part of an organized cell of agents-provocateurs to corral people as an unwitting follow-on force behind the plainclothes militants tussling with police—but who, we would later learn, were actually breaking into the Capitol beneath the Great Rotunda to storm Congress. It was just before 3 o’clock.

These apparent agents-provocateurs placed hundreds of unsuspecting supporters of the president in physical danger. They attempted to block exits for people seeking to escape tear gas. They endangered vulnerable people, including children, the frail, and the elderly.

They funneled and pushed hundreds if not thousands of innocent people into a crush toward the Capitol. They did so with the goal of forcing those people into a confrontation with federal police defending Congress.

Surreal Pandemonium

Nobody seemed aware that the Capitol was physically under attack. The tear gas caused pandemonium. But there was still no stampede, and people helped create or widen paths to allow others to leave the area.

Some, seeing frail or elderly people who had a hard time standing, broke into a pallet of black folding chairs for the inauguration and distributed them. But the mood had gone from patriotic—although contemptuous of Congress—to furious.

Rumors spread. “They say they’re going into the Congress,” someone said. “Good,” someone else said, perhaps more as an exclamation of anger at being teargassed than anything else. “That’s stupid. Cops will never let ‘em in,” said others, or in words to that effect.

Some blamed House Speaker Pelosi for ordering the police to gas her political opponents, then wondered aloud whether she really could do that. Somebody was able to get phone reception to ask if anybody knew what was happening, but couldn’t hear because of the crowd. Texting and social media posting was almost nonexistent because of overloaded towers.

Having spent decades around the Capitol since my days as a junior Senate and House staffer, and loving the building and its history as one of our greatest national treasures, I was confident that the Capitol would remain safe. But the lack of perimeter police presence, and the confused actions of those firing tear gas, flash grenades, and pepper balls from the presidential swearing-in platform had me thinking that something was wrong at the command level.

What if someone did break into the Capitol? Not possible. From out there on the lawn, a breakdown in police command and control was unthinkable.

By now, where we were on the Senate lawn, the mood was more like an outdoor rock concert gone out of control. Someone with a master key took control of a green cherry-picker, raising two people on the crane, who took pictures and waved.

Others kept people back to prevent injuries. Conscientious people looked out for the unaware or foolish. Several young people scaled the basement wall of the Senate to join people who had taken the steps to the top.

For the first time we saw a group of journalists with their cameras, computers, and transmitting gear. A few Capitol Police milled around, some winded as if they had seen action.

Uniformed, Disciplined Cadre Assembles for Attack

Then, from the north, a column of uniformed, agile younger men walked briskly, single-file, toward the inaugural stand. They came within two feet of me. Their camouflage uniforms were clean, neat, and with a pattern I couldn’t identify.

Some had helmets and GoPro cameras. Some uniforms bore subdued insignia, including the Punisher skull. These were the disciplined, uniformed column of attackers. I had seen them in groups of two or three among the marchers on Connecticut Avenue from the Ellipse.

Now there were a good three dozen of them, moving in a single, snakelike formation. They were organized. They were disciplined. They were prepared.

“We’re taking the Capitol!” the first or second announced.

“You’re gonna get arrested,” someone called out.

“They can arrest some of us, but not all of us,” another member of the uniformed contingent shouted to no one in particular.

A few curious younger people left their friends to follow them as the group disappeared under the scaffolding beneath the Rotunda entrance.

Some in the crowd expressed frustrated hope the uniformed men could teach Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a lesson, but nobody seemed to believe that they would actually do it.

I tried to text a friend to report what was happening. The jammed cell phone system made it impossible.

Spectacle of the Weird on the East Front

A small group of us exited toward Constitution Avenue, north of the Senate Wing. Someone said he had seen a person inside a second-floor window holding a “Stop the Steal” sign.

“They got into the House and Senate,” someone told us. “It’s crazy.”

A circus awaited us on the East Front of the Senate Wing. At the foot of the Senate steps, a victorious-looking crowd stood there, hanging around. A semi-naked man in what looked like a fur caveman outfit, with a Braveheart-painted face and Viking horns, struck a weirdly heroic pose as people took pictures.

The crowd there was different. People were talking about how the Capitol had been invaded. A rumor spread that “the cops shot and killed a woman inside.” The rumors were true.

We wanted to stay but decided against it. As we passed by the fountain that formed the glass roof of the visitors’ center below, several dozen Capitol Police, wearing anti-riot body armor and holding transparent shields, accompanied by what looked like DC anti-riot police and about a dozen DC National Guardsmen, walked past us in irregular formation, heading toward the Capitol building.

Some seemed winded, as if they had been in an incident, perhaps where we had been on the other side of the Senate. One officer stayed behind to help a brother policeman, who seemed to have trouble walking; a mask obscured his face but his skin looked swollen and red. He kept on walking.

We didn’t know what to say or do. It didn’t seem real, but it was. The time was 3:32 p.m. We went home in silence.

Minority Parents Fight Erasure Of Gifted Education For ‘Antiracism’,"FAIRFAX COUNTY, Va.—Last week, Harry Jackson signed into a virtual hearing of the Fairfax County Circuit Court to gauge the future of his freshman son’s school, Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. Established in 1985 as a school for gifted students, TJ has been the crown jewel of not only the Fairfax County Public Schools system but also the nation, ranked America’s No. 1 high school last year by U.S. News and World Report.

However, in superficial and dubious response to the killing of George Floyd last year, the Fairfax County School Board’s 12 members recently eliminated the race-blind, merit-based admissions tests to the largely Asian school. They argued high test performance was a “barrier” to black and Hispanic students. Most TJ students have tested in the top 2 percent of nationally normed tests that measure cognitive development, with IQ levels largely ranging from gifted at about 120 to genius at about 160.

School officials have replaced the tests with a “holistic” popularity contest for students who best fit their “Portrait of Student,” with race-based criterion, middle school quotas, and subjective markers about whether a student is an “Ethical/Global Citizen,” “Creative and Critical Thinker,” “Goal-Directed and Resilient Individual,” “Innovator,” “Problem Solver,” “Leader,” “Collaborator” and “Communicator.”

Officials also discussed bringing to the school the “anti-racism” indoctrination of critical race theory, the controversial and divisive ideology sweeping K-12 education across the country. Early data analysis shows the new admissions scheme at TJ will discriminate against gifted students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). In hearings last week, expected to continue Jan. 26, Virginia school officials are not only arguing to eliminate the admissions tests, but also undermine the very mission of the school.

A NAACP member and the first black student admitted to the U.S. Naval Academy from Lancaster County, Pa., years ago, Jackson doesn’t buy this racial politics and gerrymandering. Decades ago, Jackson’s father, a descendant of slaves from West Africa, took an academic test to attend Philadelphia’s Central High School, a magnet school for academically rigorous students. He eventually graduated from the University of Pennsylvania law school, paving the way for future black students.

Jackson is also the parent of one of 17 brave middle-school students who recently sued the school system to restore the tests as the fairest way to evaluate admissions to TJ. Education experts like Dante Dixson, a black assistant professor of school and educational psychology at Michigan State University, and organizations such as the National Association for Gifted Children argue that tests are the most race-blind way to evaluate giftedness.

But about one hour into the hearing, Jackson was shocked by what he heard. Fairfax County Circuit Judge John Tran started to ask the school system’s attorney a question about TJ, beginning, “You would be fine with it being considered a school for gifted students…”

“No!” the lawyer said, interrupting the judge mid-sentence.

“No?” Tran responded. “You’re not?”

“It is not a school for gifted students,” the lawyer insisted, conveniently ignoring decades of state Board of Education documents to the contrary, repeatedly identifying TJ as a school for gifted students. Jackson listened, stunned.

School officials trying desperately to dismiss the lawsuit took a position reflecting a wider attack on gifted students nationwide. Earlier this month, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced he is eliminating the test for the city’s gifted and talented program to also rig the program’s racial demographics, something critics like the Pacific Legal Foundation say is unconstitutional “racial balancing.”

This past fall, lobbied personally by the architect of “anti-racism,” author Ibram X. Kendi, Boston education officials eliminated their test to the academically advanced Boston Latin School and other selective schools.

“The attack on gifted education is not only a loss for students, but it’s a loss for our country. It’s a national security issue,” says Jackson. “As a nation, we should be supporting and nourishing our greatest minds. They will be our scientists, engineers, inventors, and innovators of industry. Their contributions will cross so many sectors: IT, defense, health care, government, and the arts. Our TJ graduates have an outsized positive impact on society for their numbers. They should be supported, not punished.”

Jonathan Plucker, a professor of talent development at Johns Hopkins University and president of the National Association for Gifted Children, has warned that an “ideology is turning against excellence” and “institutionalizing anti-intellectualism.” Indeed, last month, one of the chief proponents of critical race theory, Nikole Hannah-Jones of The New York Times’ controversial 1619 Project (and an Ivy League graduate) wrote on Twitter, “Gifted programs should be eliminated,” sparking a firestorm of criticism from California to New York. She previously bragged about the benefits of getting a “gifted and talented” education.

Around the country, parents are organizing to oppose ideological indoctrination in our schools and advance educational excellence. In Boston, parents have created the Boston Parent Coalition for Academic Excellence. In New York, PLACE NYC will host an Education First Mayoral Candidate Forum on Jan. 28 to pose tough questions to candidates, including former presidential aspirant Andrew Yang.

PLACE NYC cofounder Lucas Liu says, “Attacking higher-performing students under the guise of ‘equity’ grabs headlines, but won’t result in improving elementary school education, which is the where the inequity problem starts. For those ‘equity’ advocates, ‘equity’ is nothing more than a fashion accessory to make them look attractive, hiding the failures of Departments of Education to improve the academic outcomes of our most vulnerable students.” In California, Wenyuan Wu, executive director of Californians for Equal Rights, opposes the attack on gifted students as a “race to the bottom.”

In northern Virginia, where my son is a student at TJ, we’ve created Coalition for TJ, speaking at board meetings, hosting socially distant rallies where we wear facemasks that say, “JUSTICE” and #SAVETJ,” and support lawsuits, like the one filed by Jackson and the other parents. Nationally, we have strategized in Zoom calls, and have an #AdvancingExcellence campaign ready to launch as soon as we can get a breather from putting out fires set by school officials in our local communities. (I invite parents to contact me with their tips about indoctrination in K-12 schools.)

What Jackson says is true. Over the past three decades, TJ students and graduates have won national Science Bowls, geography bees, science fairs, and the bulk of northern Virginia’s National Merit scholarships, sent a satellite to space, launched technology startups like Robinhood, and pioneered advances in science, technology, engineering, and math. They’ve kept America competitive.

Earlier this month, President-elect Joe Biden named an Ethiopian-American TJ graduate, Yohannes Abraham, executive director of the Biden-Harris Transition, to be chief of staff of the National Security Council. This past weekend, Biden named scientist Eric Lander, a 1974 graduate of a specialized school in New York with a race-blind admissions test, as head of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and elevated the position to cabinet level.

In Fairfax County, school officials have said unabashedly that the new “holistic” admissions are designed to make TJ more “demographically representative” of the county, where Asian students are about 20 percent of the population. Yet rather than fixing their long-documented failures in educating black and Hispanic students, the board and school officials are simply dropping the academic bar for admission to TJ — and instituting new discrimination.

Like children with special needs, “gifted” is a legally protected class of learning because these students, too, are at-risk for bullying and dropping out of school. Nowadays, they are the target of ridicule and attack by educrats and activists from the ideology of “critical race theory” that claims “systemic racism” if there aren’t equal outcomes based on racial demographics.

For parents like Jackson, watching school officials gut gifted education in Fairfax County, Va., eliminating the very programs that uplift students isn’t the answer. He is working with the Black Student Fund, a nonprofit based in nearby Washington, D.C., to support and advance the talent overlooked in black and Hispanic communities with a STEM tutoring program that offers small student-teacher ratios, financial support, and wrap-around support beyond academics, to build the pipeline to schools like TJ.

Like so many minority parents, Jackson doesn’t want the academic bar lowered. He wants school officials to start doing their job and educating all students at the highest levels possible. Later this month, he’ll tune in again to the Fairfax County court proceedings to support one objective: education, not ideological activism.

Of Course We Don’t Need A 9/11-Style Commission On The Capitol Riots,"In the wake of the tragic riots at the Capitol on Jan. 6, there has been no shortage of hyperbolic response. We had an absurd and pointless impeachment, 25,000 troops were sent to Washington, D.C., and talking heads prattled on pretending we had been minutes away from the destruction of the republic. The latest nonsensical notion is that we now need a 9/11-style commission to investigate the events at the Capitol.

We have heard from Nancy Pelosi, Hillary Clinton, a whole host of TV hosts and left-wing politicians demanding this kind of sweeping commission is deeply needed. It’s ridiculous and dangerous. First of all, the Capitol riots were on a drastically smaller scale than 9/11. We lost 3,000 Americans in that attack, iconic New York buildings were leveled, and a hole was blown into the Pentagon. The comparison would be laughable if it were not so insulting.

In addition, thus far law enforcement, including the FBI, has been enormously successful in finding and arresting the fools who forced their way into the seat of our government. More than 100 have been arrested with more arrests happening daily. There is simply no reason to believe that American law enforcement is not capable of getting to the bottom of the attack, which is exactly what their job is.

Importantly, the 9/11 commission was formed at a time when our country was incredibly unified. There were no sides; there was very little politicking. If we followed that model, with an equal number of Republicans and Democrats on a commission to get to the bottom of what happened, would they even be able to agree on issues of scope of the investigation, or who should be targeted? Clinton thinks Trump might have been on the phone with Putin. Members of Congress have baselessly accused their colleagues of coordinating the attack. What exactly would be investigated?

But the deeper civil liberties fear would have to do with those who only attended the peaceful rally and march and never set foot in the Capitol — perhaps even anyone who ever supported Trump whom many on the left seem to think need “deprogramming.” How deeply will these Americans’ lives be investigated and for what?

Will the commission be looking for signs of white supremacy? Because leftists see white supremacy literally everywhere. They find it in statues of Abraham Lincoln commissioned by freed slaves, they find it in all of our great works of literature, and they certainly find it in anyone who does not support progressive political positions. Do we have any doubt that they will find this white supremacy in any of the tens if not hundreds of thousands of Americans who attended Trump’s rally?

The violence at the Capitol was roundly and all but universally condemned by American conservatives even as it was going on. There were no attempts to justify or couch the actions in some cloak of justice. As a result of this, there have been no copycat events, no attacks on state capitols, no hordes gathered across the Potomac ready to lay siege to our nation’s capital. Jan. 6 was a shambolic mess of poor security in which a handful of very bad actors failed miserably to rally support for their cause.

If incoming President Joe Biden’s desire truly is to lower the temperature and bring some measure of unity, then this commission is the worst thing that his Democratic allies could possibly do. A wide-sweeping investigation of whether 75 million Americans are racists ready to overthrow the government will not lower the temperature. It will make the fever spike.

For four years, the left predicted that the country could not survive a full term from president Trump and did all in their power to thwart his administration. Nonetheless, he leaves office with some remarkable accomplishments, including the creation of the vaccines that will end the nightmare of COVID-19 deaths and lockdowns. There is no reason to put the country through a divisive circus of a commission meant mostly to attack and embarrass Trump and his millions of supporters.

Let the country move on now. Let our politicians work to better the lives of the American people, not to relitigate the past four years. Trump’s supporters will not be convinced that he was anything but a great president, and his poll number among Republicans show that. Progressives will always view him and his supporters as white supremacists. No commission will ever change that basic dynamic. It is now time to look forward, not to look backward in an attempt to settle scores.

Here’s The Full List Of Every Lie Joe Biden Has Told As President,"Updated June 23, 2021

As President Joe Biden assumes the Oval Office, The Federalist will continue its rigorous coverage of the new White House, keeping the administration accountable with substantive fact-checking throughout Biden’s tenure.

59: White House Suggests Republicans, Not Democrats, Tried To Defund The Police

After last year’s summer of rage, Jen Psaki suggested that Republicans, not Democrats, were trying to defund the police.

“Part of his announcement is also ensuring their specific guidance to communities across the country to ensure that they have funding to get more community police around the country, something that was supported by the American jobs plan that was supported, that was voted into law by Democrats, just a couple of months ago. Some might say that the other party was for defunding the police,” Psaki concluded during a White House press briefing.

Here’s Jen Psaki suggesting REPUBLICANS were trying to defund police pic.twitter.com/m8pus7BS9O — Kylee Zempel (@kyleezempel) June 23, 2021

Psaki’s comments come after a year of leftist-led crusades to “defund the police” after the death of George Floyd.

Biden acknowledged the left’s quest to remove power from policing but warned civil rights leaders in December that it was the ‘defund the police’ push that granted Republicans victories in many down-ballot races on Nov. 3.

“That’s how they beat the living hell out of us across the country, saying that we’re talking about defunding the police,” Biden said in a leaked call.

58: Biden Says Corporate Media Reporters Are The Smartest People In The Entire Country

President Joe Biden told reporters on Wednesday following his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin that he thinks they’re the smartest people in the entire country.

“You all are some of the brightest people in the country,” Biden said. “I mean it, I’m not being solicitous. But it makes no sense for me to negotiate with you!”

Biden’s affirmations for his Democrat cronies in the corporate media came minutes after he told the CNN White House Correspondent she was in the wrong business, and lobbed insults at the press pool for “never” asking a positive question.

Just a few weeks ago, reporters fawned over Biden as he munched on a chocolate chocolate chip ice cream cone.

57: Biden Repeats Lie That Rioters Killed Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick

During a press conference following his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Biden once again repeated the lie that the Jan. 6 rioters killed a Capitol police officer.

“It’s one thing for literally criminals to break through [sic], go into the Capitol, kill a police officer, and be held unaccountable and than it is for people objecting, marching on the Capitol and saying ‘you are not allowing me to speak freely. You’re not allowing me to do A, B, C, or D.’ And so they’re very different criteria.”

President Biden says the ""criminals"" on Jan. 6 killed a police officer Medical examiners determined Officer Brian Sicknick died of natural causeshttps://t.co/os0fRXFpMO pic.twitter.com/C0Ml5NrooE — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) June 16, 2021

While the White House continues to tout Officer Brian Sicknick’s death as a reason to condemn Capitol rioters, the Washington D.C. chief medical examiner revealed in April that Sicknick, who died on Jan. 7, suffered two strokes and died of natural causes later at the hospital. The report followed months of erroneous coverage promoted and propelled by corrupt corporate media institutions and Democrats.

Biden’s false claim follows a deflection from Putin who mentioned the Jan. 6 riot and Ashli Babbitt’s death in response to a reporter who asked why many of his own political opponents are are “dead, imprisoned, or jailed.” Biden called Putin’s comparison “ridiculous.”

56: Biden Keeps Saying That The Economy Was Tanking Before He Arrived At The White House

Throughout his campaign for congressional Democrats to jam his expensive infrastructure proposal through both chambers, Biden has repeatedly claimed that the economy was tanking before he arrived in the White House.

“Remember, when I took office in January, our economy was in a tailspin,” Biden said last week.

As the Wall Street Journal reported, “Biden uttered these words eight days after his own Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that U.S. real gross domestic product ‘increased at an annual rate of 6.4 percent in the first quarter of 2021.'”

Biden claims his infrastructure plan will be good for the U.S. and even potentially stimulate the economy but as noted by The Tax Foundation, federal spending costs will eventually outweigh the benefits for Americans.

“We estimate the infrastructure spending would increase long-run GDP by 0.3 percent, but this positive economic effect is entirely offset by the increase in corporate taxation, resulting in less corporate investment which reduces GDP by 0.5 percent in the long run, reduces wages by 0.5 percent, and eliminates 101,000 full-time equivalent jobs,” the Tax Foundation’s analysis of The American Jobs Plan suggests.

55: Biden Repeats Claim Capitol Riot Days Before Inauguration Was Worst Assault On Capital Since Civil War

While demanding a 9/11-style commission to study the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol, President Joe Biden appeared to forget about 9/11 altogether.

Speaking to reporters outside a Cleveland-area ice cream parlor, Biden repeated his claim the riot was “the greatest assault since the Civil War on the capital.”

On Sept. 11, 2001 however, 125 people died instantly with 64 passengers on a plane flown into the Pentagon by Al-Qaeda terrorists. Only one person died at the 2021 riot at the Capitol when they were shot by security.

54: Psaki Claims ‘Number Of Officers’ Died On Day Of Capitol Riot. Zero Did.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a May 21 briefing that a “number of officers lost their lives” on the day of the January Capitol riot.

“Obviously, the president’s view is that a number of officers who lost their lives paid a tremendous sacrifice on a day that will be a stain on our democracy for many years to come,” Psaki said.

That number of officers, however, is zero.

While Democrats, in their second Trump impeachment, pointed to Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick’s death the day after the riot based on a debunked report in the New York Times, the D.C. medical examiner concluded in April that the officer died of natural causes.

53: Biden Appears to Make up Amtrak Story

At a 50th-anniversary event for Amtrak in Philadelphia, President Joe Biden said that when he was vice president, a train conductor congratulated him for traveling 1.5 million miles on Amtrak. A Fox News report out on May 5, however, pokes holes in the president’s account.

“When I became vice president, one of the Capitol Hill newspapers estimated that I had taken more than 7,000 round trips on Amtrak over my career,” Biden said. “I think that’s an exaggeration. I’m going to rely on those two conductors. … One of them was a guy named Angelo Negri.”

Biden continued, telling the audience Negri estimated Biden had traveled 1.5 million miles on Amtrak trains around his fourth or fifth year as vice president, which would have been in 2013 or 2014.

“My mom was sick, and I used to try to come home almost every weekend as vice president to see her,” Biden said. “I got on the train and Angelo Negri came up and he goes, ‘Joey, baby,’ and he grabbed my cheek like he always did. … He said, ‘Joey, what’s the big deal? One-point-three million miles on Air Force Two? Do you know how many miles you traveled on Amtrak?’ I said, ‘No, Angie, I don’t know.’ He gave me the calculation and he said you traveled 1.5 million miles on Amtrak.”

As Fox News pointed out, however, an obituary for Negri says the conductor retired in 1993, decades before Biden’s supposed story took place, while he was still a senator from Delaware. Biden’s mother died in 2010.

52: White House Says Trump Admin Spurred Border Crisis

Psaki said Trump created “an immigration system rooted in destructive and chaotic policies” that spurred the border crisis.

“Our administration immediately jumped into action to address the influx of migrants at the border, something that began during and was exacerbated by the Trump administration,” Psaki said.

While apprehensions under Trump’s leadership did begin increasing in fall 2020, border crossings surged during the first few months of Biden’s presidency. Not only did U.S. Customs and Border Protection take more than 172,000 illegal aliens into custody in March, but data also shows increases between February and March forced the CBP to stretch its chart to accommodate the largest numbers it has seen in at least two decades.

51: Biden Claims $1.8 Trillion American Families Plan Won’t Add to Deficit

Biden claimed in Virginia on May 3 while promoting the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan that the Democrats’ latest behemoth wish-list bill “doesn’t add a single penny to our deficit.”

“It’s paid for by making sure corporate America and the wealthiest 1 percent just pay their fair share,” Biden said.

According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, however, the plan “includes $1.5 trillion of offsets, resulting in a $300 billion net deficit impact over a decade.”

50: Biden Says Anyone Making Less Than $400k Doesn’t Have to Pay Taxes

Biden said that anyone making less than $400,000 a year doesn’t have to pay taxes.

“Anybody making less than $400,000 a year will not pay a single penny in taxes,” the Democrat said. “And we will not increase the deficit either, unlike the last gigantic tax cut which increased the deficit by $2 trillion.”

https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1389279329335529476?s=20

Biden’s words may be a gaffe, but even experts agree that his promise not to raise taxes on those making less than $400,000 a year is ambitious and not realistic. Even if the Democrats concentrate on “taxing the rich,” those who fall below the $400,000 mark are subject to consequences from a highly taxed economy.

49: Biden Blames Trump for the Border Crisis (Again)

During his interview with NBC News, Biden claimed that the “one god-awful mess at the border” was created by the Trump administration.

“Hey, look, here’s what happened – the failure to have a real transition. The two departments that didn’t give us access to virtually anything were the immigration [department] and the Defense Department. So, we didn’t find out they had fired a whole lot of people, that they were understaffed considerably,” Biden said.

This statement, Former Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said, is false.

“At the Department of Homeland Security, we provided the transition team with more than 200 extensive briefings on homeland security issues, the majority of which dealt with the border, immigration policy, and the processes and procedures we had in place to secure the border and reduce asylum fraud. … During the transition, the incoming Biden administration was made fully aware of the consequences of undoing the effective policies that had fixed the previous crisis and driven illegal crossings down substantially,” he said.

Biden is quick to shift the negative media coverage of the disaster at the border to his predecessor, but Trump is not responsible for the thousands of people crossing the border. Not only have the number of illegal aliens surged to record highs since Biden assumed office, but migrants have admitted that the reason they came is that they knew the Biden administration wouldn’t turn them or their families away. Even though illegal migrants may be hopeful about a future in the U.S., Biden and his team are struggling to keep up with housing the aliens in safe and clean conditions.

48: Biden Claims the Border Is ‘Under Control’

Despite his belief that Trump created the border crisis, Biden falsely claimed that it is “getting urgent action now.”

“For example, a month ago, we had thousands of young kids in custody in places they shouldn’t be, and controlled by the Border Patrol. We have now cut that down dramatically,” Biden said in an interview with NBC News.

As noted by Heritage, even if the “number of unaccompanied minors in Customs and Border Protection custody has decreased, the numbers are clear: most of those minors are simply being transferred from one government agency to another — in this CBP custody to the Department of Health and Human Services.”

47: Biden Says Trump Admin Didn’t Adequately Plan for Border Crisis

During his interview with NBC News, Biden claimed the Trump administration did not plan for the border crisis.

“For example, we have — they didn’t plan for, which it comes every year, this flow, whether it is 22,000 or 10,000, they didn’t have the beds that were available. They didn’t plan for the overflow. They didn’t plan for the Department of Health and Human Services to have places to take the kids from the Border Patrol and put them in beds where there was security and there were that people who could take care of them. So, there is a significant change right now, a significant change in the circumstance for children coming to and at the border,” he said.

As noted by Former Acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan, “This is an outrageous claim.”

“In November 2020, CBP under the Trump administration had fewer than 800 unaccompanied alien children, family units, and single adults in custody. In March of this year, that number had exploded to more than 10,000. Even though apprehensions started increasing in 2020, as growing numbers of illegal migrants gambled on a potential Biden election victory and subsequent amnesty, the Trump administration had strong policies in place to quickly and responsibly process and deport most of these individuals. This meant there was no systemic issue with backlogs or overcrowded CBP or HHS facilities,” Morgan said.

46: Biden Claims His Administration Has Control of the Border Crisis

In an interview with NBC’s Craig Melvin on “Today,” Biden falsely claimed his administration successfully reigned in the southern border crisis.

“It’s way down now, we’ve now gotten control,” Biden said.

“Do not send your kids, period. … they're in jeopardy going, making that 1000-mile trek.” -President Biden’s message to parents sending their children across the border pic.twitter.com/stHHQeUiWl — TODAY (@TODAYshow) April 30, 2021

Instead of facing the fact that U.S. Customs and Border Protection took more than 172,000 illegal aliens into custody in March, making it the busiest month for the agency in more than 20 years, Biden blamed the previous administration for not preparing for the influx exacerbated by Democrat rhetoric.

“They didn’t plan for, which comes every year, this flow, whether it’s 22,000 or 10,000,” Biden said. “They didn’t have the beds that were available, they didn’t plan for the overflow. They didn’t plan for the Department of Health and Human Services to have places to take the kid from the border patrol and put them in beds where there’s security and there were people that could take care of them.”

Biden promised that the White House and other federal agencies are taking “urgent action now,” a record-breaking 18,890 unaccompanied teens and children have been packed into overcrowded shelters plagued by COVID-19 spread and “dangerous” conditions for longer than the 72-hour limit permitted by federal law.

45: Biden Says Banning ‘Assault Weapons’ Reduced Gun Violence and Mass Shootings

Biden said that former President Bill Clinton’s ban on assault weapons contributed to the decline in gun violence and mass shootings over 10 years in his joint address.

“A ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired off in seconds … we beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined. Check out the report over 10 years,” Biden said.

President Biden once again touts the lie that former President Clinton's ban on ""assault weapons"" reduced gun violence and mass shootings over 10 years. Rep. @laurenboebert knows this is false. You can read @KatiePavlich's fact-check on the claim here: https://t.co/ALfjLcD7UM pic.twitter.com/1zCgpJ6MMN — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) April 29, 2021

As noted by Townhall’s Katie Pavlich, a 2004 University of Pennsylvania Center of Criminology study funded by the Department of Justice found that the “ban cannot be credited with a decrease in violence carried out with firearms.”

“We cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence. And, indeed, there has been no discernible reduction in the lethality and injuriousness of gun violence, based on indicators like the percentage of gun crimes resulting in death or the share of gunfire incidents resulting in injury,” the report stated. “The ban’s impact on gun violence is likely to be small at best, and perhaps too small for reliable measurement. AWs [assault weapons] were used in no more than 8% of gun crimes even before the ban.”

Biden’s claim that semiautomatic rifles with “high capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds … can be fired off in seconds” is also disputed. While a semiautomatic rifle may be able to fire off 100 rounds in less than a minute, speechwriters chose to use “seconds,” which implies a smaller timeframe than what is actually required to go through that much ammo.

President Biden is about to lie to the American people about guns. Again. My favorite here is the blatant lie that ""high capacity magazines"" enable semi-automatic rifles to fire 100 rounds in seconds. It's just not true.https://t.co/nIeYNXhF9L — Amy Swearer (@AmySwearer) April 29, 2021

44: Biden Brags That COVID Spending Bill Was Bipartisan Effort. It Wasn’t.

During his first address to a joint session of Congress, Biden said his $1.9 trillion COVID spending bill was a bipartisan effort.

“What else have we done in those first 100 days? We kept our commitment — Democrats and Republicans — of sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85 percent of American households. We’ve already sent more than 160 million checks out the door,” Biden said.

No Republicans, however, voted for the bill, which was jammed through the Democrat-controlled Congress using budget reconciliation. While Biden met with members of the GOP about the legislation to discuss changes, he ultimately refused to compromise on its price.

43: Biden Claims Jan. 6 Riot ‘Worst Attack on Our Democracy Since the Civil War’

Biden claimed in his first State of the Union address before Congress that the Jan. 6 riot was “the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.”

By the death toll, however, the United States has seen far worse.

Five died who were present at the riot, four of whom through natural causes, including the Capitol police officer whose death was weaponized by Democrats to impeach then-President Donald Trump. One Capitol rioter was killed by a police officer.

The terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, killed nearly 3,000 people after two commercial airliners flew into the New York’s World Trade Center buildings, one into the Pentagon, and one into a field in Pennsylvania.

The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, killed more than 2,400.

42: Biden Admin Repeats Fake News Russia Bounty Story to Justify Sanctions

The White House used a recently discredited narrative to justify enacting sanctions against Russia.

New reports state that U.S. intelligence had “low to moderate” confidence in a story claiming that Russia offered members of the Taliban bounties in exchange for killing American soldiers, but the Biden administration cited the narrative as one of the reasons Russia should be punished. Not only was the Russia bounty story mentioned in the White House “fact sheet” detailing the sanctions but it was also echoed by government officials.

Despite former President Donald Trump’s insistence in 2020 that the story was “fake news,” corporate media immediately latched onto the narrative and promoted it as fact. Many of the same news organizations that peddled the story have yet to walk back their previous coverage.

41: Biden Makes Misleading Statements About Gun Delay for 2015 Charleston Shooter

During his announcement of new gun control executive orders, Biden claimed that it was a three-day FBI background check delay called the “Charleston loophole” that allowed Dylann Roof to execute the 2015 Charleston church shooting.

“What happened is someone was allowed to get the gun used to kill those innocent people at a church service,” Biden said. “If the FBI didn’t complete the background check within three days. There was a process. If it wasn’t done in three days, according to the Charleston loophole, you get to buy the gun.”

As the Washington Free Beacon notes, not only did Roof shoot up the church more than two months after his background check was delayed, but “the FBI did not find the records that should have prohibited him from buying a gun” due to a mistake by the agency.

40: Biden Insists Gun Manufacturers Can’t Be Sued

Biden insisted during his gun control executive order announcement that gun manufacturers can’t be sued.

“People don’t realize the only industry in America, a billion-dollar industry, that can’t be sued, that are exempt from being sued, are gun manufacturers,” Biden said. “This is the only outfit that is exempt from being sued.”

As noted by the Washington Free Beacon, multiple gun manufacturers such as Remington and Sig Sauer have been sued over design flaws and defects in their products. The Free Beacon also noted that while the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act protects manufacturers from lawsuits “stemming from the criminal misuse of guns by third parties,” other industries including pharmaceutical companies tasked with creating the COVID-19 vaccine are protected have immunity under the 2005 Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act.

39: Biden Says Gun Show Purchases Don’t Require Background Checks

During his announcement introducing multiple gun control executive orders, Biden said background checks are not required for purchases at gun shows.

“Most people don’t know when you walk into a store and you buy a gun, you have a background check but you go to a gun show, you can buy whatever you want with no background check,” Biden claimed.

BIDEN: ""You go to a gun show, you can buy whatever you want–no background check."" pic.twitter.com/TbvfDPEwlp — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) April 8, 2021

While private firearm sellers in some states may complete gun show transactions without a background check, what many Democrats often label as the “gun show loophole,” any gun dealers with a federal firearms license are required to run background checks on customers investing in a weapon.

When confronted with a fact-check on Biden’s comments, the White House denied the president’s words just minutes after he stated them.

“No, it’s not his belief,” Psaki said. “He believes that gun that background check should be universal. … We know what his position is.”

A reporter just asked Jen Psaki why Biden lied and said, ""You go to a gun show, you can buy what you want and no background check."" Psaki just said the complete OPPOSITE and said ""it is not his belief."" These two comments were made within 60 mins of each other.

38: Biden Repeats Spurious Claims About Georgia’s New Election Law

Biden told ESPN that Georgia’s new election reform law not only bans water and food in polling lines but also closes polls early so working people can’t vote.

“This is Jim Crow on steroids, but they’re doing it in Georgia and 40 other states,” Biden said. “Imagine passing a law saying you cannot provide water or food for someone standing in line to vote. Come on. Are you going to close a polling place at 5:00, where can people just get off? This is all about people, working folks, ordinary folks that I grew up with, from being able to vote.”

Despite Biden’s claims, nothing in the new legislation suggests that voting hours should end early. In fact, the law mandates that polls be open at least 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. during early voting and offered counties the option to extend those hours to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. if necessary, a provision the Washington Post fact-checkers even acknowledged. The new law also provides exceptions for “poll officers” to give voters food and water as long as they are not provided by political interest groups.

37: Biden Insists ‘No One Making Under $400k Will See Their Federal Taxes Go Up’

During his introduction of a $2 trillion infrastructure plan, Biden repeated the lie that “no one making under $400,000 will see their federal taxes go up, period.”

“This is not about penalizing anyone. I have nothing against millionaires and billionaires. I believe in American capitalism. I want everyone to do well,” Biden said. “Right now a middle-class couple, a firefighter and a teacher with two kids, making a combined salary of say $110,000 to $120,000 a year pays 22 cents for each additional dollar they earn in federal income tax. But a multinational corporation that builds a factory abroad, jobs overseas … is bad for American competitiveness, deeply unfair to the middle-class families, wrong for our future.”

BIDEN: ""No one making under $400,000 will see their federal taxes go up, period."" pic.twitter.com/3offgNfVEY — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) March 31, 2021

Despite months of promises from Biden and his team on the campaign trail and from the debate stage, White House press secretary Jen Psaki recently clarified that individuals making $200,000 a year who are married to someone making similar amounts will be subject to the proposed tax hike.

36: Biden Repeats Falsehoods About Trump’s Tax Cut

Less than one week after he stated the claim during his first press conference, Biden insisted that “83 percent of the money went to the top 1 percent” because of Trump’s tax cuts.

Biden says again that in Trump tax cuts, ""83% of the money went to the top 1%."" That's a think tank projection of what would happen in 2027 if its individual cuts expired after 2025 as scheduled, not what has happened already; estimate is top 1% got 21% in 2018, get 25% in 2025. — Daniel Dale (@ddale8) March 31, 2021

As previously noted by The Federalist and other outlets, Trump’s tax plan not only benefitted Americans across the working, middle, and upper classes, but it also contributed to a large decrease in unemployment and underemployment. The 83 percent figure often touted by Biden, fact-checkers determined as early as 2018, is “true for 2027 but only because most of the individual income tax changes expire by then,” but not other years.

35: Biden Says Georgia’s Election Law Cuts Back Voting Hours for Working Americans

Biden is spreading misinformation that Georgia’s new election law ends voting hours early, making it difficult for working Americans to get to the polls after they leave their jobs for the day.

“What I’m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It’s sick. It’s sick … deciding that you’re going to end voting at 5:00 when working people are just getting off work,” the president said during his first press conference.

Biden repeated the falsehood in an official statement released just one day after his presser, claiming that “among the outrageous parts of this new state law, it ends voting hours early so working people can’t cast their vote after their shift is over.

While Biden insists the new law is “un-American” and “sick,” nothing in the new legislation suggests that voting hours should end early. In fact, the law mandates that polls be open at least 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. during early voting and offered counties the option to extend those hours to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. if necessary, a provision the Washington Post fact-checkers even acknowledged.

34: Biden Insists He Is Tough on China

During his first presser, Biden claimed he will “deal with China effectively” by “investing in American workers and American science” and “hold China accountable.”

The Committee on Ways and Means, however, says, “China’s corporate income tax rate is 25 percent, despite being a Communist nation” and that Biden’s promise to “increase our federal rate to 28 percent, on top of state corporate taxes, exposes American firms to takeovers from competitors based in Communist China.”

The committee also noted that Biden “has so far not committed to any action to enforce the China Phase One Agreement achieved during the Trump Administration, which included very specific requirements that protect American workers.”

33: Biden Makes Misleading Claim About R&D Investments

In his first official press event nine weeks into office, Biden claimed that research and development investments have consistently fallen since the 1960s.

“Back in the 1960s, America invested more than 2 percent of GDP in pure research and investment in science. Today it is 0.7 percent,” Biden stated.

Research and development spending, however, is at its highest point and accounted for more than 3 percent of the real GDP before the COVID-19 economic shutdown.

32: Biden Falsely States Top Corporations Don’t ‘Pay a Cent in Taxes’

During his first press conference, Biden said top corporations in the United States don’t put any money toward taxes.

“Ninety of the Fortune 500 companies making billions of dollars are not paying a cent in taxes,” Biden said, “reducing taxes to a point that people who are making, you know, if you’re a husband and wife, school teacher, and a cop, you’re paying at a higher rate than the average person making a billion dollars a year.”

The Committee on Ways and Means, however, said that the claims Biden made relied on information that “continually confused the difference between taxable income and financial statements.”

“From sales taxes to property taxes to payroll taxes, Fortune 500 companies pay billions of dollars in taxes to local, state, and federal government,” they wrote in a fact check. “Federal tax laws provide important bipartisan tax incentives to encourage specific economic activity — including investments in R&D, energy innovation, low-income housing, and distressed communities — which reduces taxable income without changing financial statement profits.”

31: Biden Says Trump’s Tax Cuts Only Helped the Rich

During his press first official press event, Biden falsely claimed that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 did not put “money in ordinary people’s pockets” and instead only helped the “top 1 percent.”

“Do you hear them complain when they passed [a] close to $2 trillion Trump tax cut, with 83 percent going to the top 1 percent? Do you hear them talk about that at all?” Biden asked.

Not only did Trump’s tax cut benefit Americans across the working, middle, and upper classes, a fact even corporate media outlets noted, but it also contributed to a large decrease in unemployment and underemployment. The 83 percent figure often touted by Democrats, fact-checkers determined in 2018, is “true for 2027 but only because most of the individual income tax changes expire by then,” but not other years.

30: Biden Says Majority of Migrant Families that Cross Border Are Sent Back

Biden said in his first press conference 64 days after inauguration that a majority of the migrant families crossing the border illegally are sent back.

“If you take a look at the number of people are coming, the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of people coming to the border and crossing are being sent back,” Biden said at the White House. “We’re sending back the vast majority of the families that are coming.”

According to Customs and Border Protection data, however, a fraction of the 20,000 family units apprehended have been sent back.

Further, Michelle Hackman, who covers immigration for the Wall Street Journal, reported on March 23 that an internal document she reviewed with her colleagues found that the weekend prior to Biden’s press conference, “only about 10 percent of families were being expelled.”

29: Biden Says Trump Admin Didn’t Address Communist China’s Human Rights Abuses

During his first official press conference, Biden implied that his predecessor former President Donald Trump did not address communist China’s human rights abuses.

“I made it clear that no American president, at least one did, but no American president ever backed down from speaking out of what’s happened to the Uyghurs, what’s happened in Hong Kong, what’s happening in the country. That’s who we are,” Biden said. “The moment a president walks away from that, as the last one did, is the moment we begin to lose our legitimacy around the world.”

The Trump administration, however, did directly condemn China’s actions against the minority Muslim population located in the Xinjiang province as a genocide before leaving office. Following investigations into the CCP’s use of mass imprisonment of more than 1 million people, forced labor, forced sterilization, torture, and limits on religious freedom, freedom of expression, and freedom of movement, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared that the United States has definitively evaluated and labeled these actions by the CCP as “crimes against humanity.”

Secondly, the Biden regime just deleted the State Dept page highlighting China’s human rights abuses: https://t.co/Py9yNKPFsD — R.J. Kassam (@RaheemKassam) March 25, 2021

The Trump administration previously issued sanctions against China shortly after Trump signed the “Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020” into law in June of 2020.

28: Biden Says Migrants Not Flooding the Border Because of Him

During his first press conference, Biden claimed illegal aliens are not crossing the southern U.S. border because of his rhetoric and open border policies, but because migrants’ chances of “dying on the way because of the heat in the desert” are lower in January, February, and March and because of the instability in their home countries.

“I guess I should be flattered people are coming because I’m a nice guy. … The truth of the matter is, nothing has changed. … That’s not the reason they’re coming. The reason they are coming is that it’s the time they can travel with the least likelihood of dying on the way because of the heat in the desert, number one,” Biden said. “Number two, they’re coming because of the circumstances in [their] country.”

Biden believes surge in migrants is due to conditions in their countries & weather that's better for traveling not because he's seen as a ""nice guy"" who's lax on the border

While Biden might be convinced people are flooding to the U.S.-Mexico border in a normal immigration cycle, Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador recently said it is the new president’s migration policies and rhetoric that sparked hopeful “expectations” and created the border crisis.

“Expectations were created that with the government of President Biden, there would be a better treatment of migrants. And this has caused Central American migrants, and also from our country, wanting to cross the border, thinking that it is easier to do so,” López Obrador said, just weeks after he told reporters that many of those crossing the border illegally view Biden as “the migrant president.”

Some illegal aliens who crossed the border have also testified that Biden was the deciding factor for why they chose to come to the U.S.

“So did you come here because Joe Biden was elected president?” ABC’s Martha Raddatz pressed.

“Basically. Basically,” one migrant father replied. “The main thing was the violence in our country. And the second thing, I think, was Joe Biden.”

27: Biden White House Claims Regular Talks With McConnell

White House press secretary Jen Psaki claimed at a March 24 briefing that the president regularly speaks with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

McConnell’s office, however, told NBC News reporter Julie Tsirkin that the two have only spoken once since the inauguration in January, which focused on the military coup in Myanmar.

26: Biden Lowers Tax Hike Threshold After Promising It Would Only Affect People Making Over $400K

While the president recently told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that his bid to increase taxes would only apply to “anybody making more than $400,000,” and that any individual making less than that amount “won’t see one single penny in additional federal tax,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki recently clarified that individuals making $200,000 a year who are married to someone making similar amounts will be subject to the proposed tax hike.

This revelation comes after months of promises from Biden and his team on the campaign trail and from the debate stage that their attempts to raise taxes would not affect individuals making under $400,000 a year but eventually morphed into households making under $400,000 a year. Studies from at least five economic analysis institutions suggest, “Biden’s proposals would increase taxes, on average, for households at every income level” and that his intention to repeal Trump’s tax cuts would only further this outcome.

25: Biden Makes Sweeping Projection About Child Poverty

During his March 11 address, Biden said the COVID-19 spending bill “will cut child poverty in this country in half, according to the experts.”

While researchers at certain think tanks and universities conceded that portions of the American Rescue Plan have the potential to “reduce child poverty by more than half in 2021,” the provisions in the bill apply only to this year, leaving the long-term effects of the spending bill on child poverty a mystery. There is no current evidence to suggest that the policies included in the plan will have a long-lasting effect on child poverty.

24: Biden Overreports Number of Vaccinated American 65 and Older

In his address on March 11, Biden lied about when the COVID-19 vaccine first became available in the United States. He also misspoke about the number of Americans 65 and older who have received the vaccine.

“When I took office 50 days ago, only 8 percent of Americans — after months — only 8 percent of those over the age of 65 had gotten their first vaccination,” Biden said. “Today that number is 65 percent.”

The vaccine, however, was not available for months before Biden took office. The first COVID-19 vaccine dose in the United States was administered on Dec. 14, just one month before the new president transitioned into the White House. Not only was Biden wrong about when the shots first became available, but he also lied that 65 percent of Americans 65 years old and above have been vaccinated. As of Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that only 62.4 percent of those 65 and older received at least one round of the vaccine, not 65 percent.

23: Biden Claims US COVID Death Toll Exceeds Three Wars and 9/11

During his address to the nation on March 11, Biden falsely claimed that the total number of coronavirus deaths in the U.S. was more than those in World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, and 9/11.

“I carry a card in my pocket with a number of Americans who have died from COVID to date. It’s on the back of my schedule.

As of now, total deaths in America: 527,726. That’s more deaths than World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, and 9/11 combined,” Biden stated.

President Biden notes the more than 527,000 COVID-19 deaths in the United States: ""That's more deaths than in World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War and 9/11, combined."" https://t.co/Zv4cfRYdhW pic.twitter.com/NKcXVzZcyy — PBS NewsHour (@NewsHour) March 12, 2021

While Biden is correct in saying that at least 527,726 Americans have reportedly died from coronavirus, the nation’s death toll does not exceed the fatalities that resulted from the three wars and one terrorist attack he mentioned in his speech. Even without 9/11 included, more than 580,000 people died fighting in the aforementioned wars. “World War I: 116,516 deaths, World War II: 405,399, Vietnam: 58,220” the Washington Post reported.

22: Biden Claims Coronavirus Was Met with Silence

In his prime time address to the nation on March 11, Biden claimed the novel Wuhan coronavirus “was met with silence and spread unchecked.”

The Trump administration, however, convened a White House coronavirus task force, which CNN complained was too white, while congressional Democrats were pursuing partisan impeachment proceedings.

Biden begins his speech by attacking the Trump administration with lies: ""A year ago, we were hit with a virus that was met with silence and spread unchecked. Denials for days, weeks, then months.

21: Biden Says Goal of 100 Million Vaccine Shots in 100 Days Was Tough for Him to Meet

Biden claimed his administration’s initial goal of administering 100 million shots in his first 100 days was difficult to meet in his prime time address on March 11.

“When I came into office, you may recall, I set a goal that many of you said was kind of way over the top,” Biden said. “I said I intended to get 100 million shots in people’s arms with my first 100 days in office.”

That vaccination pace, however, had already been met by his White House predecessor. About 1.3 million Americans were vaccinated on Biden’s first full day in office.

20: Biden Says COVID Spending Bill Garnered Bipartisan Support

Shortly after Democrats in the Senate passed the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 spending bill, Biden falsely claimed in a celebratory speech that the legislation garnered bipartisan support.

“Quite frankly, without the overwhelming bipartisan support of the American people, this would not have happened. Elected officials heard overwhelming public support. Every public opinion poll showed overwhelming support for this plan,” Biden said.

Just watched his whole 10-minute monologue and this did happen. Also tries to describe bill as bi-partisan even though not a single Republican in either chamber voted for it https://t.co/P6HFBIePqD — Julie Kelly 🇺🇸 (@julie_kelly2) March 6, 2021

Despite Biden’s rhetoric pretending that the legislation received support from people on both sides of the political aisle, every Republican senator voted against passing the massive bill. Last month, the White House agreed to meet with 10 Republicans to discuss a smaller relief proposal that cut spending by almost two-thirds. Biden, who launched his presidency on a platform of unifying the country and toning down partisanship, however, did not budge on his decision to push the legislation through both chambers of Congress without GOP support.

19: Biden and White House Deny Border Crisis as Crossings Surge

Biden denied that there is a crisis at the border after departing a White House briefing in early March evaluating how to provide more than 20,000 beds for the largest projected influx of unaccompanied migrant children who are crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.

“We’ll be able to handle it,” Biden told reporters as he was escorted out of the room by his vice president.

When asked if there’s a border crisis, Biden says “no”https://t.co/1r8KjY5OKR pic.twitter.com/itA90NEAyo — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) March 2, 2021

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas also told reporters at the beginning of March that there is no crisis at the southern border, despite his own agency’s projections that more than 117,000 unaccompanied minors will attempt to cross the U.S.-Mexico border this year, numbers that are on track to exceed the current record of minors in federal custody by 45 percent. More than 13,000 of them are expected to come to the United States in May, giving the Biden administration just two months to sort out its plans for housing migrant minors after refusing to expel them.

“Do you believe that right now there is a crisis at the border?” a reporter asked.

“No,” Mayorkas said. “There is a challenge at the border that we are managing. … The men and women of the Department of Homeland Security are working around the clock seven days a week to ensure that we do not have a crisis at the border, that we manage the challenge, as acute as the challenge is.”

18: Biden Says Administration Not Opening New Migrant Centers

Biden falsely claimed during a February interview with Univision that the new administration is merely reopening migrant camps operational during the Trump administration even as the Biden White House creates new ones.

“They opened up one, one that was a former one used in the administration in the last administration,” Biden said. “Our hope and expectation is that won’t stay open very long and that we’ll be able to provide for every kid who comes across the border safely.”

https://twitter.com/BonillaJL/status/1365450210227458051?s=20

Border agents opened up a new facility in Donna, Texas, three weeks ago, according to the Washington Post, while creating new camps in Del Rio, Texas, and Arizona.

17: Biden Repeats False Claim That Trump Told Public to Inject Bleach

Biden repeated the debunked story, rated false even by left-leaning PolitiFact, that President Donald Trump recommended during a White House coronavirus press briefing to inject bleach.

“I think there’s a growing awareness that injecting bleach into your system doesn’t do it for you,” Biden said in remarks to black essential workers.

Trump, however, said no such thing, as Biden also asserted last summer. Instead, Trump was speaking on the role of disinfectants help in preventing serious infection with viruses such as the novel Wuhan coronavirus.

Speaking w/ Black essential workers, Biden says, ""I can't tell you how much a difference you're making. We have met with people all over the country…I think there's a growing awareness that injecting bleach into your system doesn't do it for you.""

16: Biden Lies Again About Not Inheriting a Vaccine Plan

During his visit to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing plant in mid-February, Biden once again falsely claimed that his administration did not inherit a vaccine plan from former President Donald Trump.

“Just over four weeks ago, America had no real plan to vaccinate most of the country,” Biden said. “My predecessors — as my mother would say, God love ’em — failed to order enough vaccines, failed to mobilize the effort to administer the shots, failed to set up vaccine centers. That changed the moment we took office.”

Despite this repeated claim from Biden as well as Vice President Kamala Harris and White House press secretary Jen Psaki, officials such as Anthony Fauci have reassured the public that the Trump administration and Operation Warp Speed did not leave the Biden administration empty-handed.

“We’re certainly not starting from scratch, because there is activity going on in the distribution,” Fauci said, disputing the White House’s claims.

Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration’s project to facilitate the creation and distribution of the vaccine, also passed along a plan to Biden and his team once they assumed office.

15: Biden Says There Is ‘Overwhelming Consensus’ to Pass Excessive COVID Spending

During a February CNN town hall with Anderson Cooper, Biden claimed there was “overwhelming consensus” to pass a coronavirus spending bill with excessive funding.

I’m committed to pass — look, here’s — some of you are probably economists or college professors or you’re teachers in school. This is the first time in my career — and as you can tell, I’m over 30 — the first time in my career that there is a consensus among economists left, right, and center that is over — and including the IMF and in Europe, that overwhelming consensus is, in order to grow the economy a year, two, three, and four down the line, we can’t spend too much.

A column in the Wall Street Journal published in January disproves Biden’s erroneous assertion by highlighting remarks from several of Biden’s own political allies on the left who refute the idea of passing a gargantuan package.

Another article in the New Yorker published days before Biden’s CNN appearance cited warnings over Biden’s $1.9 trillion relief package by prominent economists.

“The 1.9 trillion program could overheat the economy so badly as to be counterproductive,” Olivier Blanchard, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, tweeted.

14: Biden Denies Psaki Said Schools Should Open Just One Day a Week

The same night he claimed a COVID-19 vaccine was not created until after he joined the White House, Biden denied that White House press secretary Jen Psaki ever said schools should be open just one day a week, claiming it was simply “not true” and eventually clarifying his statement to say it was “mistaken in communication.”

Asked about @PressSec saying that schools should be open one day a week, Biden says ""that's not true"" and it was a ""mistaken in communication."" The quote from Psaki: pic.twitter.com/TVbeo80JnB — Philip Melanchthon Wegmann (@PhilipWegmann) February 17, 2021

At the beginning of February, Psaki proudly declared that Biden’s goal to have children back to classroom learning by his 100th day in office, in April, only applied to half the country’s schools and only requires one day of in-person learning — meaning just 50 percent of kids attending school for about five days total would accomplish the “goal.” When a reporter asked her to clarify the Biden administration’s position, Psaki doubled down on the plan to require just one day of in-person learning per week in “the majority of schools.” Days later, the White House flip-flopped its position on school reopenings, and Psaki told reporters that Biden’s plan was to ensure every school would be open “five days a week.”

13: Biden Claims COVID Vaccine Wasn’t Around When He Assumed Office

During a CNN town hall on Feb. 16, Biden falsely claimed the United States did not have a COVID-19 vaccine when he transitioned into the White House in late January.

President Biden said in reference to a vaccine — ""Which we didn't have when I came into office."" That's just blatantly false. @CnnTown — Beverly Hallberg (@BeverlyHallberg) February 17, 2021

Against faulty predictions from journalists, so-called experts, and verified Twitter users who cast doubt on former-President Donald Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, the first round of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was administered in the United States to health care workers in mid-December following the Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use and mass distribution approval. The FDA also applied emergency authorization to the Moderna vaccine in mid-December, approving it for widespread distribution and use long before Biden joined the White House.

Biden received both doses of the Pfizer COVID vaccine before he was inaugurated.

12: Biden Statement on Impeachment Falsely Attributes Officer’s Death to Capitol Riot

Biden’s statement on Trump’s impeachment acquittal opened with the assertion that a Capitol police officer who died on the day of the January riots was killed by the mob of Trump supporters storming the congressional complex.

“It was nearly two weeks ago that Jill and I paid our respects to Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who laid in honor in the Rotunda after losing his life protecting the Capitol from a riotous, violent mob on January 6, 2021,” Biden said.

There is absolutely no evidence to prove, however, that Sicknick was brutally killed by the mob that day, a claim amplified by Democrats throughout the impeachment proceedings with the help of legacy outlets such as the New York Times, which quietly later issued a correction as the trial came to a close.

Amazing: the NYT just quietly appended this so-called ""update"" – which is really a correction if not a retraction – to its Jan 8 article about Officer Sicknick's death.

11: Kamala Harris Repeats Bogus Claim New White House Starting ‘From Scratch’ on Vaccines

Vice President Kamala Harris repeated the bogus claim that the Biden White House has been forced to start “from scratch” to handle the coronavirus vaccine rollout.

“We’re starting from scratch,” Harris said, “on something that’s been raging for almost an entire year.”

Even National Institutes of Health Director Anthony Fauci rejected the assertion made by White House officials in January, as the Trump administration reached the 1 million shots-a-day threshold Biden has attempted to claim credit for.

10: Biden Said He Would Fire Staff ‘On the Spot’ for ‘Disrepect.’ Hasn’t Fired Deputy Press Secretary

Biden issued a stark warning to about 1,000 presidential appointees upon taking the reins of the Oval Office.

“If you’re ever working with me and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect or talk down to someone, I promise you, I will fire you on the spot — on the spot. No ifs, ands, or buts,” Biden said.

On Feb. 12, however, Vanity Fair reported White House deputy press secretary TJ Ducklo threatened a Politico reporter inquiring about a romantic relationship with an Axios political reporter tasked with covering the vice president after leaving the Biden beat.

“I will destroy you,” Ducklo reportedly threatened Politico’s Tara Palmeri, if the paper published the story.

Instead of unemployment, however, Ducklo was given a one-week suspension without pay.

9: Biden Said He ‘Misspoke’ When Claiming US Would Reach Only 100 Million Vaccines in 100 Days

Biden said during a Jan. 25 press conference he “misspoke” when claiming the United States would reach only 100 million coronavirus vaccine shots given out within the administration’s first 100 days, a pace reached by the Trump administration. Biden then emphasized a hope of reaching 150 million instead.

The White House COVID-19 Response Team tweeted two days later, however, that the Biden administration’s goal of 100 million doses in 100 days hasn’t changed.

The President set an ambitious goal of administering 100 million shots in our first 100 days. To get there, we’ve got to average about a million shots per day.

8: Biden Trashed Trump’s China Travel Ban as Xenophobic Before Signing His Own

When Trump implemented a travel ban on China in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, then-candidate Biden railed against the executive action as “xenophobic,” claiming such restrictions do not work.

Less than a year later, Biden has implemented his own travel bans on South Africa, Brazil, Great Britain, and 26 other European countries in the second week of his presidency.

7: Biden Team: Trump Vaccination Plan ‘Worse Than We Could Have Imagined’

After Biden staffers lied, telling CNN there was “nothing for us to rework” in terms of a vaccination distribution plan, White House press secretary Jen Psaki admitted at the podium during a Jan. 25 briefing that there was a plan — they just won’t give credit. Psaki told reporters the plan from the Trump White House was “much worse than we could have imagined.”

The plan inherited by the Biden White House, however, has already put the new administration on a trajectory to reach its goal of getting 100 million people vaccinated within its first 100 days.

Below is the chart outline for the distribution process under Operation Warp Speed, which produced not one, but two coronavirus vaccines in record time.

6: Biden Warns Pandemic Will Worsen After Pledging to Shut Down Virus

Biden spent the entire campaign last year running on a platform to shut down the novel coronavirus, only to back away from the signature pledge on day three of his White House tenure with a bold admission.

“There’s nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months,” Biden said on Jan. 22.

Not only did Biden’s official campaign promise acknowledge that “the trajectory of COVID-19 in America is headed in the wrong direction” and that his administration would be the solution, but Biden also pledged numerous times to “immediately put in place a national strategy that will position our country to finally get ahead of this virus and get back our lives.”

5: Biden Claims Federal Government Never Acted with Urgency to Combat Pandemic

Joe Biden claimed the federal government failed to “act with the urgency” that was necessary to combat the coronavirus pandemic, apparently neglecting to mention the Trump White House’s Operation Warp Speed that produced two viable coronavirus vaccines by the year’s end.

Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn also pointed out that Congress passed trillions in stimulus, providing funds for pandemic efforts and economic recovery.

4: Biden Team Tells CNN Trump Offered No Plan for Vaccine Distribution

Sources within the Biden administration told CNN they inherited no vaccine distribution plan from the previous White House.

“There is nothing for us to rework. We are going to have to build everything from scratch,” one source reportedly told CNN’s MJ Lee, except there was, as outlined in Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, included below.

The Biden team’s statements were also contradicted by Dr. Fauci the same afternoon.

“We’re certainly not starting from scratch, because there is activity going on in the distribution,” Fauci told reporters.

3: Biden White House Claims Elites ‘Celebrating’ Is Exception to Mask Edict

White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki justified Biden’s decision with his family to forgo face masks at the Lincoln Memorial after signing an executive order requiring them on all federal lands.

“He was celebrating a historic day in our country. … We have bigger things to worry about,” said Psaki, whose dismissal of the face mask as an insignificant issue was contradicted by the White House edict passed hours earlier.

Though Biden has received both shots of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines stipulate that vaccinated people are to continue wearing face masks, citing a lack of research showing whether those vaccinated can still spread the virus. While Biden likely did not need to wear a face mask, considering he was outside and adequately distanced from others, the absence of a mask flies in the face of Biden’s executive order, in which “celebrating” is not listed as an exception.

2: Biden Falsely Claims ‘All’ Media Smeared Vaccine Plan as ‘Impossible’

Joe Biden defended his administration’s goal to vaccinate 100 million Americans within his first 100 days in office after a reporter questioned whether the target was too modest.

“When I announced it, you all said it wasn’t possible. C’mon. Gimme a break, man,” Biden snapped.

1: Biden Vows to Be Unity President After Smearing GOP Sens. as Nazis

Biden launched his first term as commander-in-chief by branding himself as the unifier-in-chief while aggressively pursuing a partisan progressive agenda promoting left-wing ideas of “social justice” after smearing two Republican senators as Nazi collaborators.

“To all those who did not support us, let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart,” Biden pleaded with the American people.

Less than two weeks prior, however, the “unity” president smeared Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas as Nazis.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/01/22/heres-the-full-list-of-every-lie-joe-biden-has-told-as-president/,2021-01-22
McConnell's Impeachment Ploy Was An Attack On The Base,"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell “got a load off his chest” with his speech closing out Friday’s second failed impeachment attempt against former President Donald Trump. “Unfortunately,” however, “he [also] put a load on the back of Republicans. That speech you will see in 2022 campaigns.”

Who’s responsible for that quote? It might surprise some it wasn’t Donald Trump Jr. or Rep. Matt Gaetz — it was Sen. Lindsey Graham, a moderate, hawkish Republican not up for re-election for six whole years.

“I would imagine if you’re a Republican running in Arizona or Georgia or New Hampshire, where we have a chance to take back the Senate, they may be playing Sen. McConnell’s speech and asking about it as a candidate,” Graham said on “Fox News Sunday.” “And I imagine if you’re an incumbent Republican people will be asking if you’ll support Mitch McConnell in the future.”

McConnell isn’t a man used to public rebukes from the corporate wing of his party, but after the past month’s antics they are rightly deserved. Friday’s floor speech was no quick tantrum: It was the last stupid moments of the minority leader’s plan to purge the GOP of Donald Trump — a plan that began to unravel nearly immediately after its poorly conceived Jan. 12 rollout in the pages of The New York Times.

So what’s all behind this? After four years of yelling “MAGA!” while pushing his own classic, corporate Republican policies, McConnell had hoped to rid himself and his conference of the conservative populist nationalism the former president had championed and go back to the way things were. He wants a return to promising to tackle illegal immigration before winking at corporate America that nothing will change. He wants to raise money on fighting the abortion of our infants while comfortably lifting nary a finger. He wants to shrug and change the subject when asked about men dominating women’s sports and using women’s bathrooms. He wants fewer taxes and more wars. Hell, he wants someone to blame for the Republican losses in the Georgia special election, and with them the loss of his seat at the head of the Senate.

Instead, his push to impeach ended with rebuke from his own conference. Angry and embarrassed, he blamed his own colleagues as well as the former president, performing a 20-minute attack ad for the left to use on Republicans for the next election cycle and beyond.

Observers might call this stand selfless statesmanship, but a true statesman distinguishes himself from the operative, ideologue, or even philosopher by mediating between the real and ideal, prudently seeking out the possible without regard to his own interests. After five years of Russian and Ukrainian conspiracy theories and loudly cheered mob violence against Americans, Washington Democrats sought to smear the president and his supporters as the sole culprits of our divisions. They’d been hurling these accusations for years, and the terrible mob attack on the Capitol combined with Trump’s refusal to accept a finished-if-deeply-flawed election gave them the sword to make one last, unconstitutional try of it. McConnell tried to swing that sword.

“I think his speech is an outlier regarding how Republicans feel about this, “Graham said Sunday. “…The process they used to impeach this president was an affront to the rule of law… The trial record was a complete joke, hearsay upon hearsay, and… if you use this model I don’t know how [Vice President] Kamala Harris doesn’t get impeached if Republicans take back the House because she actually bailed out rioters and one of the rioters went back to the streets and broke somebody’s head open. So we’ve opened Pandora’s Box here and I’m sad for the country.”

Graham is right. The second impeachment trial was the final act in years of Democrats trying to usurp the former president and isolate and ostracize his supporters. After January’s shocking $8.3 million post-election fundraising haul — driven largely by small gifts averaging $32 a person — the decline of corporate and PAC influence in favor of base voters’ influence is starkly visible. Corporate politicians like McConnell don’t like this shift because it makes them responsible to that base, so this year, instead of trying to lead a changing party, he stamped his approval on Democrats’ attacks on it.

Far from over, as so many in power would prefer, the lines of the populist conservative fight for the Republican Party and the country are more clearly and publicly drawn than ever before. When they eventually take back the Senate as the pendulum of voter anger inevitably swings back against the current Washington rulers, Senate Republicans would do well to remember the opening months of 2021 — and remember Mitch McConnell.

"After Just One Month In Office, Biden Orders Airstrike In Syria","Just weeks after President Joe Biden promised that “diplomacy is back at the center of our foreign policy,” he ordered a U.S.-led airstrike in Syria targeting a building used by Iranian-backed militant groups on Thursday.

Defense officials told numerous corporate media outlets that the strike was meant to incapacitate the militia and prevent them from carrying out future attacks. They also claimed the strike was a defensive response to multiple recent attacks in Iraq, which threatened American lives.

“These strikes were authorized in response to recent attacks against American and Coalition personnel in Iraq, and to ongoing threats to those personnel. … The operation sends an unambiguous message: President Biden will act to protect American and Coalition personnel. … At the same time, we have acted in a deliberate manner that aims to de-escalate the overall situation in both eastern Syria and Iraq,” Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement. Kirby also said the action was meant to “de-escalate the overall situation in both Eastern Syria and Iraq.”

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters on Friday that he was the one who recommended the airstrike to Biden. “I’m confident in the target that we went after, we know what we hit,” Austin said, noting, “We’re confident that that target was being used by the same Shia militants that conducted the strikes” in February in Iraq, injuring a U.S. service member and other coalition personnel and killing a civilian contractor. Despite the high-profile nature of the strike and the implications it has for Biden and the United States just one month into the new president’s term, some corporate media outlets brushed off prioritizing the issue.

Just last year, Biden also criticized Trump numerous times for taking action against Iran and terrorist Quds force leader Qasem Soleimani without congressional approval. “Let’s be clear: Donald Trump does not have the authority to take us into war with Iran without Congressional approval. A president should never take this nation to war without the informed consent of the American people,” Biden wrote on Twitter. Corporate media such as the New York Times, Washington Post, and MSNBC also mischaracterized Trump’s decision to take out Soleimani as an “assassination,” labeling the terrorist a “revered military figure,” and hysterically hinting that the next world war was fast approaching. Some outlets even echoed talking points from Iranian propagandists in their coverage.

Biden Administration Refuses To Say Middle East Militias Are Iran-Backed,"President Joe Biden’s Pentagon press secretary John Kirby refused to link Iran to Shia militias operating in Iraq that launch frequent attacks on U.S. troops and other allies in the region.

Speaking to reporters Wednesday after an attack on Iraq’s Ain al-Asad Airbase, where an American contractor died of a heart attack this week, Kirby refused to say the Shia Iraqi militias, which likely carried out the strike, were aligned with Iran.

“When you say Shia-backed militias, do you mean Shia militias or Iran-backed?” one reporter asked to clarify during Wednesday’s briefing.

“I mean Shia-backed militias,” Kirby said.

Somehow it’s okay to offend tens of millions of Shiite Muslims but not call out the brutal regime in Iran.🤦‍♂️ — Mark Dubowitz (@mdubowitz) March 5, 2021

The attack on Iraq’s Ain al-Asad came after a similar episode at the Erbil International Airport in Kurdistan Region, Iraq, in February, which killed a civilian contractor and wounded several Americans. This attack preceded U.S. airstrikes in Syria.

“Obviously it’s a rocket attack and we have seen rocket attacks come from Shia-backed militia groups in the past,” Kirby said of the strike in Iraq this week. “We’ve long been open and honest about the threats that arise from these rocket attacks that are being perpetrated by some Shia-backed militia. And we’ve not been bashful about calling it out when we’ve seen it.”

The refusal to link Iran with the Shia militias, however, signals a softer policy on Iran from the Biden White House, which immediately embarked on jumpstarting negotiations to rejoin the Iran deal, opening the door for the Middle Eastern sponsor of terrorism to obtain a nuclear weapon.

"Media, Police Rumors Of Another Capitol Attack Prove To Be A Dud","Prophecies of another attack on the Capitol on March 4, reportedly spread by QAnon, went unfulfilled Thursday, leaving the federal grounds devoid of any action and people other than members of the National Guard.

The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI issued a joint memo just one day before the allegedly potential attack, reportedly warning that “domestic extremists” were ramping up to “take control of the U.S. Capitol and remove democratic lawmakers on or about the 4th of March.”

Capitol Police also signaled the threat of a breach, while federal agents conducted investigations into “whether there was an increase in the number of hotel rooms being rented in Washington, as well as monitoring flights to the area, car rental reservations and any buses being chartered to bring groups into the capital.”

Some law enforcement officials including Timothy Blodgett, the acting House sergeant-at-arms, said there was “no indication that groups will travel to Washington D.C. to protest or commit acts of violence,” but some including Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi alleged these reports as gospel truth, even canceling Thursday’s session, a fact she downplayed later.

Corporate media outlets including The New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, and MSNBC also latched onto and amplified the narrative that militias would “attack” the Capitol and declare former President Donald Trump the leader of the nation once again. Contrary to their predictions of a rebellion on March 4, DC streets remained relatively empty as razor-wire topped fences, National Guard members, and other performative deterrents have been stationed around the Capitol grounds and parts of the city for multiple weeks now.

“This threat is credible. It’s real,” Democrat Rep. Michael McCaul told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Wednesday.

I was told there was going to be an insurrection? Guys you're making me feel kinda silly down here. pic.twitter.com/E2peIa6gvc — Christopher Bedford (@CBedfordDC) March 4, 2021

March 4 wasn’t the only day the media wrongly predicted violence and chaos by Trump supporters. Shortly before the Democrats’ second attempt to impeach Trump, Politico warned, on the word of unnamed sources in the National Guard, that there were rising “impeachment security concerns” such as rowdy demonstrations that would occur starting at the beginning of the trial in February. The same excuse was used during President Joe Biden’s inauguration, which was heavily guarded and restricted.

Even though the DC streets and Capitol remained devoid of any of the formerly predicted “insurrectionists,” Capitol police asked the National Guard to stay in the city for at least two more months due to unspecific “security concerns.”

Defense officials say the Pentagon is reviewing the proposal to extend the National Guard's mission at the U.S. Capitol by 60 days. The more than 5,000 Guard members currently in Washington, D.C., are currently slated to go home on March 12. https://t.co/7c0ZwFwFba — The Associated Press (@AP) March 4, 2021

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott Attacks Free Speech Social Media Platform Gab,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, joined by two state legislators, launched an attack against the free speech social media platform Gab on Wednesday, promoting legislation that reportedly “fights antisemitism” in the Lone Star State.

“Antisemitic platforms like Gab have no place in Texas and certainly do not represent Texas values,” the Republican said in a video posted on Twitter on Wednesday. In the clip, Abbott is shown sitting in front of an Israeli flag. “What does represent Texas values is legislation like this by Rep. King and Rep. Goldman that fights antisemitism in Texas.”

Anti-Semitic platforms do not represent Texas values. Proud to support @PhilKingTX & @GoldmanCraig’s bill to fight anti-Semitism in our communities. #txlege pic.twitter.com/ZVri3z0Wis — Gov. Greg Abbott (@GovAbbott) March 11, 2021

It is unclear which legislation Abbott is referencing. While Rep. Craig Goldman recently introduced a bill discussing the Texas Holocaust and Genocide Advisory Committee, the bill does not mention Gab nor antisemitism.

Gab defended itself by directly responding to Abbott’s tweet and explaining how it supports “the political speech of all Americans.”

“Gab is not an ‘anti-semitic’ platform,” the social media company replied. “We protect the political speech of all Americans, regardless of viewpoint, because in this age of cancel culture nobody else will. That means unpopular viewpoints may be found on the site.”

https://twitter.com/getongab/status/1369825514064666629?s=20

Gab’s CEO also blasted the governor for targeting the company for no apparent reason.

“There are many Jewish Gab users and customers, whose lawful speech we protect with just as much zeal as we would protect the lawful speech of any person of any faith, ethnicity, or creed,” Andrew Torba said in a statement topped with a header resembling Texas’s unofficial but popular “come and take it” flag design. “This is what America used to be like: a place where The People could speak freely regardless of their faith, ethnic background, or beliefs. This is the America Gab is fighting to preserve. Apparently, Gov. Abbott doesn’t agree.”

Torba also noted how the governor is sending mixed messages by denouncing Gab, a social media platform dedicated to free speech, just days after he announced legislation meant to curb Big Tech’s efforts to censor or deplatform users they disagree with, specifically conservatives.

“The enemies of freedom smear us with every name in the book because they hate America and they hate free speech. It’s a shame to see a GOP politician fall for this trap when conservative values are under sustained attack all over the country,” Torba continued. “People smear Gab for the kinds of people we host. They never smear Gab for the kinds of people we ban. That’s because we don’t have political tests for our users. Ban decisions are made on an individual basis. Our test for political speech is whether it is legal or not. Pretty simple rule.”

U.S. Military Just Made A Political Attack On Joe Biden’s Opponents,"After a cable news host irresponsibly attacked the U.S. military for aiding in the “death of the republic” by taking to the streets of the U.S. capital for use against the American people, the coordinated response from the Department of Defense through its public affairs channels was swift and unforgiving.

The headline in the Defense.gov news article said it all: “Press Spokesman Destroys Host for Despicable Suggestion about US Military Use.” This was a response to an MSNBC cable show host using her show to denigrate the contributions of the U.S. military in quelling riots and potential insurrection on the streets and to imply that their actions are contributing to the “death of the republic.”

“Let me be clear,” the spokesman angrily replied. “The U.S. military’s mission is to defend the nation against all threats, foreign and domestic. At the same time, it guarantees the people’s liberties to peacefully protest and to petition the government for redress of their grievances. We would never use them to squash First Amendment-guaranteed liberties. Any suggestion by this cable news host to the contrary is scurrilous and an absolutely outrage.”

Senior uniformed military leaders were quick to join the chorus of condemnation. “I’ll remind everyone that her [Rachel Maddow’s] opinion — which she has a right to — is based off of actually zero days of service in the armed forces,” said the command senior enlisted leader of a U.S. Combatant Command in a video posted to his official military Twitter account.

A service chief said in his 38 years of military service, he had never heard such a despicable calumny about how the U.S. military operates: “To suggest we would ever employ our brave men and women in uniform to suppress peaceful protest is disreputable and an insult to our fighting force.”

After nearly 40 years in and around this career field, I have never seen such an unprecedented display by the Department of Defense to rhetorically firebomb a member of the Fourth Estate for disagreeing with the U.S. military. Through news articles, Twitter feeds, public affairs talking points, and messages to senior military leaders, the department weaponized its public affairs arm to launch an unprecedented PR offensive to denigrate a journalist and perhaps cancel her for her views.

Wait—the Trump Department of Defense never did any of this in response to those actual words of Rachel Maddow linked above: No spokesman denunciation, no coordinated reaction by senior military leaders, no complaint that she should keep her mouth shut because she never served a single day in uniform.

The Trump DoD never did any of this. But Joe Biden’s DoD just did.

Attacking a Pundit for What He Didn’t Say

Last week, Fox cable host Tucker Carlson called out DoD for introducing a flight suit for visibly pregnant women. Flight suits are worn by pilots to wage our nation’s wars. It seemed incongruous that the military would issue flight suits to pregnant women, who most assuredly do not fight our nation’s wars.

When the unit I served with in Iraq learned that two of our female soldiers were pregnant, the U.S. military put them on the highest priority to be evacuated back to the United States. Within 24 hours, they were sent home. They wanted to stay—God bless them!—but the DoD would not hear of having pregnant women in a war zone.

Whether Carlson was right or wrong or presented his views in a strident manner is immaterial. He had an absolute right to say it. The Department of Defense’s leaders disagreed. What should have been a one-line refutation in a run-of-the-mill daily press briefing became an all-hands public affairs campaign to destroy Carlson.

Defense.gov posted an article celebrating how “Press Secretary Smites Host that Dissed Diversity in the U.S. Military.” Carlson did nothing of the kind. He took issue with sending pregnant women to war, which is what is implied by designing flight suits for pregnant women.

Press Spokesman John Kirby, who knows better as a retired public affairs Navy admiral, could have issued a simple correction saying, “No, the U.S. military does not send pregnant women to war. Pilots may wear flight suits in day-to-day duties stateside and this does not imply we send pregnant women to war.” Instead, he chose to excoriate Carlson for what Carlson did not say, which was that women should not be sent to fight our nation’s wars.

From Information to Disinformation

Defense.gov is a DoD tool for commanders to inform the troops and the American public about what is going on in the military, as they have an obligation to do. “The mission of Defense.gov is to support the overall mission of the Department of Defense by providing official, timely and accurate information about defense policies, organizations, functions and operations. Defense.gov is the single, unified starting point for finding military information online” (emphasis added). Or, in this case, for finding military disinformation and misinformation online.

Reporter Jim Garamone’s article noted that Kirby remarked a “Fox cable show host used his show to denigrate the contributions of women in the military and to say the Chinese military is catching up to the U.S. military because it does not allow women to serve in the percentage the United States does.”

Is that what Carlson did and, even if it was, is it the DoD’s responsibility to find fault with him for that opinion? It is not. Remember, Defense.gov is run by the government. Garamone is a federal career civil servant, not a political appointee as Kirby is. The federal government just used its career professionals to target a working journalist for destruction.

Using the Military to Attack Political Viewpoints

It is unseemly, of course, for a DoD spokesman to so venomously misrepresent what an opinion journalist said and then to question why the journalist dared to say it. This is even worse than that. It is an atrocious assault on the operation of a free press to then coordinate a department-wide propaganda campaign to smear a journalist for saying things he didn’t and to dissent from DoD policies with words he did say.

The military's social media attack against Tucker Carlson was coordinated. https://t.co/80RpjHO0dd — Max (American Jew) (@MaxNordau) March 14, 2021

Kirby runs the DoD public affairs operation. He ordered his staff to issue public affairs guidance in the form of messages and talking points that were disseminated throughout all the services within the Department of Defense. These encouraged senior military leaders to publicly call out Carlson for what he did not say. We call this disinformation, misdirection, and misinformation.

This is a gross violation of DoD’s own Principles of Information against engaging in propaganda. Congress specifically prohibits military public affairs from functioning as a public relations firm for the DoD. That is why it is called public affairs and not public relations. Despite this, the DoD has just abused its public affairs resources to arguably violate statutes and DoD regulations. It unarguably violated longstanding norms of propriety and its own principles of information.

How the Military Is Supposed to Talk to Media

There is a hierarchy of credibility when service members speak to the press. To the news media, the most credible member of the Armed Forces the foot soldier. He speaks his mind. The problem with that comes when he speaks his mind about things that he is not informed about, such as DoD policies.

He can give a reporter his opinion, whether it is uninformed or not. But public affairs’ job is to remind him he should stay in his lane, and to speak honestly and frankly only about things he knows about or for which he is responsible.

The higher up the military chain of command one goes, the more likely reporters are to find military people who don’t speak their mind, but only state what their command, service, or the DoD wants them to say. And that’s OK. They are not being paid to give out personal opinions, but to speak out on behalf of and in support of the institution.

They are often the most informed about the institution, so are highly credible in speaking about its policies. They are not to lie or dissemble, but may explain why they might be constrained in answering a question directly.

When a flag officer (general or admiral) speaks, you can be assured he is not freelancing his views. They have much more important and reputable things to do with their time. If they are speaking out, it is because they are giving the DoD position on an issue.

In this case, they ought to have recognized that their place is not to share their personal views on a spat between an opinion journalist and the Department of Defense. But they have. By echoing and supplementing political views, they’ve let themselves become a tool of the political appointees at DoD.

Damaging Military Effectiveness and Credibility

Let’s not be coy about this, either. Gen. Paul E. Funk III may think he is being clever in his tweet against Carlson below. Instead, he is damaging his own credibility and that of the military service he has dedicated his adult life to. His troops who see this campaign for what it is—a campaign to silence a critic—will have much less respect for him for letting himself be played.

Although it is usually not advisable, civilian political appointees may engage in a war of words with someone who figuratively buys “ink by the barrel.” But Kirby did more than that here. He engineered a propaganda campaign to slam down the full weight of the DoD to silence one opinion journalist for daring to utter his, well, opinion.

This is more than disturbing. It is downright scary.

Carlson is a big enough cable news host that he can survive this onslaught. But what of lesser-established journalists? They have bills to pay and families to feed. They are not going to risk that when they witness this awesome destructive display of organized vitriol by the DoD.

A Shot Across the Bow

In addition, does anyone think this is a one-off? It is a proverbial “shot across the bow” by the Biden DoD: Oppose us and we will destroy you. If not vehemently opposed, it will become precedent-setting.

Plenty of journalists utter views contrary to what Biden’s DoD prefers. Is it prepared to go after all of them? Or will it just target journalists on the right? For all the cries of fascism regarding Donald Trump’s government and his many ill-advised tweets, his DoD, for instance, never attempted to destroy Maddow for speaking her mind, even when she questioned DoD policies or campaigns. That may change now.

Why does it matter? Military folks pride themselves as being the ones who fight our nation’s adversaries to ensure all Americans can speak freely and the news media can publish without fear of government retribution, as in repressive societies.

This week, our military knowingly spoke out to destroy a journalist for exercising his free speech right. If let to stand, it will serve as an existential threat to our republic and to our military.

This Is a Fight to Engage

There must be fallout from this. Reporters of all stripes need to apply maximum outrage and pressure upon the DoD for this, lest it become standard operating practice. Senators must use all the tools at their disposal to demand accountability.

Soon senior military leaders will be testifying on the DoD and individual services budget requests. Senators must put them on the hot seat. “General, what other strident opinions do you think you should comment upon?” Senators can then list a compilation of strident comments from reporters against whom the DoD did not launch a campaign of verbal and written destruction.

“Sounds like they ‘disrespected’ the military there. Shouldn’t you have called them out? How about this one? And this one? Oh, I see, you don’t think so. Would you characterize this as more inflammatory and strident than Carlson’s opinions? If his opinion was less egregious, why did you lead a coordinated effort to destroy him and not these other journalists? Is it because those journalists’ views seem more in line with the present administration? General, you military guys like to say that we enjoy First Amendment speech and a free press because you military folks fight enemies of those hallowed freedoms. Was that what you were doing when you sought to destroy this opinion journalist for uttering opinions? Could you draw me up a list of other ‘enemies of the DoD’ that you would approve destroying?”

Retired Military Should Also Speak Out

I am not a fan of retired military people speaking out on political issues, unless they are running for political office, which they are entitled to do, as any citizen is. When they speak out on military issues, even when they include “retired” next to their name, they are still lending the prestige of their former rank to a given issue.

Yet there are times actions taken by leaders in the military are so disgusting that retired military leaders must speak out. They rightly condemned the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, which was an assault on our government. Now they must speak out again in no uncertain terms to denounce the government’s attack on a free press.

Without carefully weighing the consequences, DoD may have just unleashed a whirlwind against itself this week. This will harm the institution, the public’s support, and our service members’ ability to do the jobs our nation calls them to do.

In a just climate, on Monday Kirby would admit the abuse, apologize, promise DoD public affairs will never do this again, and promptly resign. Falling on his sword would protect the true instigators and enablers at the highest levels of DoD and the White House.

https://twitter.com/InezFeltscher/status/1370917703834349568?s=03

The military’s reputation has suffered a tremendous self-inflicted hit. We must use our voices to ensure those running it understand this is never to be repeated.

Patrick A. Swan is a retired military and federal civil service public affairs professional with more than 39 years’ experience around the career field both stateside and in combat zones. For a time in the mid-1990s, he served as director of the Army News Service, an official government entity chartered to inform soldiers similar to how the Associated Press serves to inform the public.

3 Key Takeaways From The U.S.-China Summit In Alaska,"The Biden administration’s first high-level meeting with Communist China in Anchorage, Alaska, last week opened with a war of words, then closed with nothing meaningful to show in the end. Still, there are some critical takeaways from this important summit.

1. Diplomacy Is Political Theater for Domestic Audiences

The traditional understanding of diplomacy is that through dialogue and negotiations, countries seek to influence each other’s behaviors to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome while avoiding war. Diplomats are not soldiers. Therefore, when diplomats speak, especially in front of a camera, their tone tends to be measured, and their words tend to be vague. They generally avoid insulting the other side publicly, to leave room for negotiation and compromise.

The Chinese delegation’s behavior, however, broke this diplomatic norm. Even though China agreed to the summit schedule in advance, including a four-minute opening statement, Yang Jiechi, director of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Chinese delegation lead, ignored the schedule by speaking for more than 15 minutes.

He filled his long remark with insults to the United States, including insisting that the United States “does not have the qualification to say that it wants to speak to China from a position of strength. The U.S. side was not even qualified to say such things even 20 years or 30 years back.” Yang’s contempt for the U.S. delegation and the nation they represent couldn’t have been more obvious.

Yang’s offensive words, his tone, and his attitude were all part of a performance meant for the audience back home, including his boss, the CCP’s leader Xi Jinping. Ever since he came to power, Xi has presented himself as the strongman China needs and the only one who will “return” China to its former glory. Xi unleashed a group of Chinese “wolf” diplomats to show Chinese people that his government knew how to stand up to those western powers that “humiliated” China in the past.

These Chinese “wolf” diplomats often break diplomatic protocols by acting aggressively and making offensive remarks to threaten human rights activists, journalists, and even government officials. They are combative and treat every criticism of China, no matter how legitimate it is, as a mortal threat to the longevity of the CCP’s rule in China.

They exploit Western social media’s openness by promoting CCP propaganda and spreading misinformation and conspiracies while suffering no consequences. Understandably, these “wolf” diplomats haven’t won many friends for China internationally, but they help Xi solidify his popularity among the growing Chinese nationalists.

Yang’s disdain of the United States in Alaska in front of the worldwide press served two purposes at home. First, it pleased Chinese nationalists. Yang’s condescending remarks were widely reported in China. The Global Times, a Chinese state media that often speaks on behalf of China’s nationalist movement, praised Yang for teaching the United States a good lesson by refuting the U.S. “arrogance in public.”

Second, many suspect Yang did what he did to benefit his career. Yang is part of Politburo, a 25-person decision-body of the CCP. But the CCP and China’s real power lies with Politburo’s Standing Committee, which is led by Xi and has only six other members. Yang’s performance in Alaska will undoubtedly burnish his nationalist image, win further favors from his boss Xi, and lay the groundwork for Yang’s possible elevation to the Standing Committee.

2. Communist China Employs U.S. Left’s Rhetoric to Attack America

During his long remarks, Yang often employed rhetoric from the American left to attack America. He lectured American diplomats on democracy, stating, “Many people within the United States actually have little confidence in the democracy of the United States, and they have various views regarding the government of the United States.”

On the topic of human rights, Yang claimed it is the United States, not China, that needs to improve.

“The fact is that there are many problems within the United States regarding human rights, which is admitted by the United States itself as well … the challenges facing the United States in human rights are deep-seated. They did not just emerge over the past four years, such as Black Lives Matter,” he said.

In a recent editorial about the Alaska summit, China’s Global Times claimed: “everything Washington talks about is centered on the US and on white supremacy.” U.S. adversaries have long regarded race divisions as a soft underbelly of the United States and have exploited it to undermine the United States’s global leadership and sow self-doubt and division among Americans.

What’s more challenging today than the Cold War between the United States and the former Soviet Union is that the American left has gone beyond simply criticizing America’s imperfections. Today’s extreme leftist rhetoric condemns America’s founding and its founding principles. American people have been told that America is fundamentally and irredeemably racist, that the United States is a nation founded on white supremacy and white nationalism, and a country that has always oppressed people of color because of “systemic racism.”

This rhetoric ignores the universal appeal of our nation’s founding principles, including the progress our country has made toward achieving equality and liberty for all, the fact that we’re the most diverse and welcoming nation on this planet, and that millions of U.S. immigrants still believe in the American dream.

Unfortunately, the Biden administration has accepted the American left’s rhetoric as truth, has repeated this rhetoric in many official capacities, and lets it drive policy decisions. Therefore, when Yang used this rhetoric to attack the United States at the Alaska Summit, both National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken gave weak responses.

Joel Pollak, editor-at-large of Breitbart News, tweeted “Biden’s team is learning a hard lesson here: when you spend years talking about how awful America is, how we suffer from ‘systemic racism,’ blah blah, it undermines our standing on the world stage. Moral self-confidence is a strategic asset.” We cannot expect U.S. officials to defend America forcefully on the international stage if they don’t have moral confidence in our country.

3. The Biden Administration’s China Policy Lacks Clarity

The great power competition between the United States and China should be one of the Biden administration’s highest priorities. Yet it has been three months since Biden was sworn into office, and there is no clarity on what his China policy is. As a presidential candidate and now as the president, when asked about his China policy Biden’s answer has always been that he will “work with allies.”

Both Sullivan and Blinken reiterated the same point at the Alaska summit. But “working with allies” is not a strategy. It is, at best, a means to achieve strategic goals. Sometimes it is not even a reliable means because some allies are not reliable.

For example, the European Union signed in principle a comprehensive investment deal with China last December, despite the incoming Biden administration’s concerns. Sullivan urged the Europeans to delay the agreement’s signing and request a consultation with the United States.

The Biden administration hoped the United States would work with the EU to counter Communist China’s aggression at home and abroad. But the EU chose a different path because it couldn’t resist China’s mass consumer market. If “working with allies” is a strategy, it failed at its first test.

Biden’s insinuation Trump failed to “work with allies” is also unfair. Biden held his first meeting with leaders of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, a strategic alliance created to counter China’s aggression in the Indo-pacific region, also known as the Quad. Former President Trump enjoyed good relationships with Quad member states Australia, India, and Japan.

By working with these allies, the Trump administration made a historic breakthrough in the Middle East peace process by facilitating several peace deals between Israel and a few Arab nations, an accomplishment many previous U.S. administrations aspired to but failed to achieve.

To protect our national interests and preserve world peace, the Biden administration should try to build upon where Trump’s foreign policy succeeded rather than abandoning these policies out of contempt for Trump.

Xi is clear about what he wants. He wants to establish a new Sino-centric world order, replacing the liberal world. But the lack of clarity in Biden’s China policy makes America vulnerable to China’s attack.

American people deserve to know: besides providing China’s “wolf” diplomats with a world stage to insult U.S. diplomats, what did the Biden administration accomplish at the Alaska summit? The longer it takes for the Biden administration to clarify its China policy, the more it will endanger our national security while strengthening Communist China’s hand.

The United States may lose even more allies and partners to China as a result. The Biden administration should do its best to avoid such outcomes.

The Truth About Nation Of Islam Complicates That Capitol Attack Media Want To Forget,"There was an attack at the Capitol last week by a devotee of Louis Farrakhan, the 87-year-old in charge of the Nation of Islam. Noah Green bought a knife and rammed his car into the barriers on Good Friday, injuring one Capitol Police officer and killing another, Billy Evans, who leaves behind two young children.

How could he do this? What would motivate him to buy a knife, drive his car into the Capitol, murder one officer, and try to murder others? It’s all a great unsolved mystery to authorities and corporate media.

“Suspect in attack at U.S. Capitol described as average jock whose mental health appeared to quickly unravel,” a Friday night USA Today headline read.

“Green’s motives are not entirely clear,” a Monday story in The Hill read. “A U.S. official told the Associated Press over the weekend that Green had been suffering from delusions, paranoia and thoughts of suicide.”

“The suspect’s motive isn’t known,” The New York Times reported Wednesday morning, “but he posted on social media about his struggles during the pandemic.”

In a Monday statement professing the peaceful nature of the Nation of Islam, the organization blamed mental illness for the attack. “I am sure had he been blessed to come through the crisis that he was going through,” Farrakhan said, “he would have been a star in the mission of the resurrection of our people. We need to know what happened to our brother.”

Too bad, indeed. “He would have been a star.”

For those as unfamiliar with the tenets of the Nation of Islam as its leaders would like, it preaches some things like self-empowerment and self-sufficiency, but it does all this toward black supremacy, virulent racism, shocking antisemitism, and conspiracy theories that would be hysterical if so many angry, vulnerable young men didn’t believe them.

Its creation story tells of white people being made by an ancient mad scientist over centuries in his laboratory to torment the noble black race. It all begins well over 6,000 years ago, when Islam (which, they might be surprised to learn, is only a 1,400-year-old religion) controlled Africa and Asia, which were just one massive continent back then. The American Indians were bad Muslims so the black Muslims sent them to North America, but they’re generally still cool with the Nation. And the white devils, who are subhuman and have no souls, by the way, were kicked out to live in caves in Europe where our love of bestiality birthed apes and, somehow, donkeys I guess.

It’s an obviously ridiculous and deeply hateful religion, and it’s sold to vulnerable young black men in prison, on the streets, and increasingly on the internet, where Green appears to have begun his “studies.”

“For us, human life is sacred,” the organization claimed, and a lot of people might buy it.

The New York Times, one of the few corporate outlets showing any interest in the story since Easter, describes Nation of Islam as “a black nationalist movement that has advocated African-American self-sufficiency” and preaches on the coming fall of the United States. Hardly the definition they might give for a white nationalist militia group.

The Associated Press seemed to struggle with the concept that a black supremacist had killed a police officer at all, tweeting Monday that Evans died “when a car rammed into him and another officer.”

It’s all reminiscent of the Pulse Nightclub shooting, when authorities just couldn’t discern why a man who said “I did it for Islam” did it. Or the Mall of America stabbings, where the first charging documents didn’t list a motive, though he would go on to confidently tell the judge he was answering “the call for Jihad.”

Or when CNN claims, “White supremacy and hate are haunting Asian Americans,” despite no evidence that anything other than prostitution played a role in a sick and sex-addicted man’s March massage parlor shootings. Or how when it emerged that the national surge in attacks on Asian Americans isn’t driven by white Americans after all, NBC explained how that’s not a hate crime. Or how the corporate media struggles to confront black attacks on Orthodox Jews.

It’s rare that just one thing plays into a person’s radicalization or racial violence. Financial problems, COVID lockdowns, mental illness, terrible parenting, and the rest are all worthy of any serious investigation. But when hateful, conspiratorial, anti-American cults and religions pray on just those very people, well, it seems a crucial detail. And when white supremacy is far from a driving force in rising hate crimes, it seems important to focus on what is.

But crucial details can complicate the narrative. And we couldn’t allow that, could we?",https://thefederalist.com/2021/04/08/the-truth-about-nation-of-islam-sure-complicates-that-capitol-attack-corporate-media-would-like-to-forget/,2021-04-08
FBI Director Wray Refuses To Say If Antifa Has Organized Finances,"Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Christopher Wray refused to disclose whether Antifa has the capability to organize, receive funding, and coordinate attacks during the House Intelligence Committee’s annual public World Wide Threats Hearing on Thursday.

Wray began his answer about Antifa by declaring it is a “real thing.”

“There are certainly local and regional nodes, individuals who self-identify with Antifa and commit violent attacks, citing that as their motivation, and we have a number of predicate investigations into such individuals and Antifa is a real thing. It’s not a fiction,” Wray admitted, despite Democrats and their media allies previously calling Antifa a “myth.”

When pressed by Republican Rep. Michael Turner of Ohio about the organizing, training, and financing of Antifa, however, Wray was reluctant to divulge information.

“Again we have seen individual instances and small regional nodes of people coming together to train in some cases,” Wray said. “There’s not some big national structure responsible for the violence.” Wray also noted that “the financing issue is something we continue to investigate, but there’s nothing that I can share at this time with the committee on that.”

Turner, however, continued to press Wray to answer whether Antifa received funding on a local or national level.

“They have obviously been deployed throughout the United States. We’ve seen them burning federal buildings, the self-professed members, claiming members of Antifa — do they or do they not have organized financial support?” Turner asked. When Wray repeated that the FBI continues to investigate, the Republican questioned whether Antifa had the capability to coordinate and target specific locations.

“At the local level, in some cases, the regional level we have seen organized activity, people working together,” Wray conceded.

The tense exchange comes as rioters, some of whom are reported to be “self-identified Antifa members,” made their way to the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center to cause destruction in response to the fatal shooting of Daunte Wright.

During the hearing, Wray admitted that while these Antifa members may have traveled in from other cities to wreak havoc, he still might classify them as “local.” “My definition of local doesn’t mean people who just live in the same city,” Wray said.

“So like, if you travel across the country to perpetrate violence, you become local where you perpetrate the violence?” Turner asked.

“When I say local or regional, I’m including people from the surrounding area,” Wray continued. “And that may or may not include people from other parts of the state, for example.”

Staples Won't Condemn Lebron’s Attack On Cop Who Saved Black Girl,"National office supplies retailer Staples, which owns the naming rights to the arena that hosts the Los Angeles Lakers, refused to denounce Lakers star Lebron James’ targeted attempt to incite violence against a police officer who saved the life of a black teenage girl.

James has once more stirred up racialized political controversy. James has since deleted a tweet in which he posted a picture with the caption “YOU’RE NEXT #Accountability” in regard to the Columbus, Ohio police officer who on Tuesday appears to have protected a black teen from being stabbed by another by shooting the assailant as the teens fought.

Police officers convicted in the court of public opinion over applying force to black Americans have received death threats and in the past year cities across the nation have been looted, trashed, and burned in riots over such incidents.

A high-profile ESPN on-air employee who spoke on condition of anonymity told The Federalist in an interview that “it’s a very dangerous thing that the most prominent player in the sport [NBA] is doing something like this.”

“Is he backing [his tweet] up with statistics, or is it just based on emotion? It’s obviously based on an argument that is the popular argument to make. How is that not a threatening tweet?” The employee said. “This is where, you know, especially people in sports lose a lot of their fans. Kind of like this selective outrage. David Stern [the former NBA commissioner] must be spinning in his grave.”

Spokeswoman Julie Haff for the Republican Party of Los Angeles said James’s comments were “irresponsible and very counterproductive for any conversation related to policing or race relations.”

“Sending out a tweet like that is just very irresponsible,” Haff added.

Staples Center, which paid the Lakers $100 million for endorsement and naming rights in 1999, had no problem involving itself in other political controversies when it was bound to earn plaudits from the left. Since acquiring the arena’s rights, Staples has provided a venue for the Lakers, in addition to the Los Angeles Clippers and other minor league teams.

Data from 2014 showed earnings of $345 million for the arena, making it the number one venue in the United States by revenue. The Staples Center carried a price tag of $70.5 million in taxpayer money when it was built. The publicly financed stadium’s sponsor is clearly comfortable weighing in on political issues — but not in weighing in when its most lucrative client’s employee openly incites violence.

The Federalist emailed and called Staples after James deleted the tweet to understand if it agrees the NBA star was out of line. The company responded, “Staples stands behind our corporate values, which include respect for all people.”

Staples Stores tweeted its support for “black communities” during the summer of Black Lives Matter’s rioting and looting, but is unwilling to voice its support for the black community at a time a police officer ought to be commended for saving a black life. James perhaps realized his tweet was in poor taste, given his deletion, but one of the key corporations earning millions due to a contract with him has not.

“Staples stands with our Black colleagues, neighbors and friends,” the company said in a statement in June. “We do not and will never tolerate hatred, prejudice or discrimination. We are committed to supporting Black communities in both learning and working, and are donating funds and resources to both Black teachers and minority-owned small businesses. We must do better as a community and a nation, and Staples is committing to doing so.”

The Federalist also contacted The Staples Center arena directly to receive a comment, but did not hear back after being transferred to a few different individuals over the phone.

The corporation’s silence instead of support for the black teenager who gets to live another day thanks to this police officer speaks volumes about its so-called position of being “committed to supporting Black communities.”

On Wednesday evening following the deletion of his tweet, James blamed “the entire system” and said he is “so desperate for more ACCOUNTABILITY.” The Lakers star essentially doubled down and declined to admit that his prior tweet calling out a police officer was unethical and with a high potential to cause violence.

I’m so damn tired of seeing Black people killed by police. I took the tweet down because its being used to create more hate -This isn’t about one officer. it’s about the entire system and they always use our words to create more racism. I am so desperate for more ACCOUNTABILITY — LeBron James (@KingJames) April 21, 2021

“LeBron and others live to promote the victim narrative, so much so they will post without any verification if it meets their self-fulfilling narrative,” Brandon Tatum, a former police officer in Tuscon, Arizona, who hosts “The Officer Tatum” show on YouTube, told The Federalist. “This goes to show these celebrity athletes are out of touch. I believe the only reason he deleted it was because the obvious nature of self-defense could make him liable in a defamation lawsuit.”

The ESPN employee added that LeBron “is beholden to the league itself and to its players who are African American,” and that leftist virtue-signaling from corporations like the NBA “has backfired from a financial standpoint.”

“[The NBA] is taking cues from LeBron and ESPN wants to maintain a good relationship with LeBron,” the employee added.

Israel Defense Forces Take Out Hamas Commander Amid Conflict,"Israel killed a leading Hamas commander in a strike on Tuesday as significant conflict erupts between Israel and Hamas.

“We just killed the commander of the Hamas anti-tank missile unit, Iyad Fathi Faik Sharir,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement. “He was in charge of carrying out anti-tank missile attacks on Israel. Our aircraft are currently striking additional terror targets in Gaza.”

The Islamist terrorist group Hamas fired hundreds of rockets into Israel from the Gaza Strip, including targeting Jerusalem. Israel then launched strikes Monday, hitting over 130 Hamas installations, as well as intelligence and weapons manufacturing sites.

“Overnight, in response to continuous rocket fire from the Gaza Strip at Israeli territory, the IDF struck over 130 terror targets belonging to terror organizations in the Gaza Strip,” IDF said in a statement.

“In the first and second stages of the strikes, IDF fighter jets, attack helicopters and aircraft struck weapons manufacturing sites belonging to the Hamas terror organization. In the third stage, targets belonging to the Hamas terror organization and the Islamic Jihad were struck, including: weapons manufacturing sites and military facilities belonging to the Hamas terror organization and the Islamic Jihad. A Hamas battalion commander was also targeted,” IDF said.

Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., was accused of “stoking tensions” by Israel Ambassador to the U.S. Gilad Erdan.

“Congresswoman @RashidaTlaib maybe you should open your eyes to the whole picture? Islam’s 3rd holiest site is being used to stockpile Molotov cocktails and rocks that are being lobbed at the police and at Jewish worshippers praying at the Western Wall, below the Temple Mount,” Erdan tweeted.

As reported by Axios over the weekend, Israel told the Biden administration to remain on the sidelines of the conflict, citing a lack of trust that the U.S. would help. Israeli officials said Israel’s National Security Advisor Ben Shabbat allegedly instructed the U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan that “international intervention is a reward to the Palestinian rioters and those who back them who were seeking international pressure on Israel.”

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday the U.S. is “deeply concerned about the rocket attacks” Hamas fired after it issued an ultimatum to Israel to remove police from Jerusalem. The Israeli military summoned 5,000 members on reserve to active duty amid Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying Israel will “increase both the intensity of the attacks and the rate of attacks” to combat the terrorists.

Former President Donald Trump reacted to the conflict Tuesday, noting the attacks highlight how the world is becoming “violent” and “unstable” under the Biden presidency.

“Biden’s weakness and lack of support for Israel is leading to new attacks on our allies. America must always stand with Israel and make clear that the Palestinians must end the violence, terror, and rocket attacks, and make clear that the U.S. will always strongly support Israel’s right to defend itself,” Trump said in a statement. “Unbelievably, Democrats also continue to stand by crazed anti-American Rep. Ilhan Omar, and others, who savagely attack Israel while they are under terrorist assault.”",https://thefederalist.com/2021/05/11/israel-defense-forces-take-out-hamas-commander-amid-conflict/,2021-05-11
"Trump Slams Biden, Democrats For Weakness After Israel Was Attacked","Former President Donald Trump slammed the Biden administration for failing to stand up for Israel after it was attacked by the militant Palestinian group Hamas this week.

“When I was in office we were known as the Peace Presidency, because Israel’s adversaries knew that the United States stood strongly with Israel and there would be swift retribution if Israel was attacked,” Trump said in a statement on Tuesday. “Under Biden, the world is getting more violent and more unstable because Biden’s weakness and lack of support for Israel is leading to new attacks on our allies.”

Trump not only condemned these attacks but said that it is America’s duty to aid and support Israel.

“America must always stand with Israel and make clear that the Palestinians must end the violence, terror, and rocket attacks, and make clear that the U.S. will always strongly support Israel’s right to defend itself,” Trump said.

The Republican also denounced Rep. Ilhan Omar and other Democrats who “savagely attack Israel while they are under terrorist assault,” as Trump said.

Many will tell you Israel has a right to defend itself, to safety and security, but are silent on whether Palestinians have those rights too. Until we can defend the rights of Palestinians just as we do Israelis, we have no leg to stand on when it comes to justice or peace. — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) May 10, 2021

Under Trump, peace in the Middle East began in September when the Republican signed the Abraham Accords and facilitated formal diplomatic agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Israel and Bahrain. Under the once-thought-impossible peace deals, all three nations sought to “establish embassies, exchange ambassadors, and begin to work together as partners.” Other priorities in the normalization agreements included promoting freer travel and religion.

Just one month after the historic peace deals, Trump ordered that Sudan be removed from the U.S. State Sponsors of Terrorism list and ensured the nation would deepen Sudan’s engagement with the West by building relationships with Israel. In addition to normalizing relations and ending “belligerence between their nations,” Trump’s administration also facilitated an agreement promoting trade and cooperation negotiations between the nations that he said will bring “peace in the region.”

When Biden’s State Department spokesman Edward “Ned” Price took over, however, he adamantly refused and deliberately avoided naming the former president’s foreign policy achievements.

“They’re normalization agreements,” Price repeated numerous times in a press conference last month. “Look, we call them – we call them normalization agreements. That’s precisely what they are.”

“There’s a specific name that they all signed onto. I believe you know what it is,” the reporter pressed. “Why do you not use the name that the leaders of these countries signed onto, which is the Abraham Accords? Why is that?”

“I’m not averse to using that,” Price claimed. “I’m describing what these are … Of course I can say the term ‘Abraham Accords,’ Matt, but we call them normalization agreements.”

While the Biden administration cowers, other nations such as Germany have issued statements in support of Israel.

Foreign Minister @HeikoMaas on the sidelines of his visit to Rome: Firing rockets at #Israel is absolutely unacceptable and must end immediately.

How NYT Manufactures Lies For Democrats To Attack Their Opponents,"Glenn Youngkin pulled ahead of his competitors, winning a surprise victory in the Virginia Republican primary Monday night. Within moments, Terry McAuliffe, the former governor and the strong favorite to win the 2021 Democratic nomination, attacked. On economic, immigration, taxation, or infrastructure plans? Nope: McAuliffe called Youngkin a “Big Lie believing” election conspiracy theorist.

Let me introduce you to Glenn Youngkin: Glenn's a Ted Cruz and Corey Stewart-endorsed, self-funding, Big Lie believing Trump loyalist who'll stop at nothing to advance the GOP's extreme agenda. What he’s definitely not? The next Governor of Virginia. I'll make sure of that. — Terry McAuliffe (@TerryMcAuliffe) May 11, 2021

He’d used the attack before, when in February Youngkin rolled out his proposed Election Integrity Task Force. Of course, “conspiracy theorist” is not an unusual attack to see in politics, and especially since Sen. Barry Goldwater’s unsuccessful 1964 run for president, it’s been a favorite for Democrats to use against Republicans.

While during the Clinton White House years broad accusations of “the vast right-wing conspiracy” were sufficient to help dull Republican attacks on the president, more substantive and specific attacks are always more effective. Typically, that job falls to opposition research firms paid by the candidates and their parties to dig up dirt on their opponents, but sometimes you don’t need those as much, for example: when you have The New York Times on your side.

Enter the Times: At Virginia’s Republican gubernatorial debate on April 27, the moderator opened with a question that had been submitted by the Republican Women of Greater Richmond. “Please explain in detail your plan to ensure we have election integrity in Virginia,” the moderator read, “and in particular, if Dominion voting systems and machines are used on Nov. 3, 2021, will you immediately pursue an independent audit of the results when you are sworn in as governor?”

The question referred to nationally recognized — and angrily contested — questions on the integrity of 2020 election in states like Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, specifically referencing accusations of rigged Dominion voting machines, which were never proven true. As any practiced politician or debater knows, however, the specifics of the question matters less than the answer given.

“Ladies and gentlemen, this is the most important issue we’re going to talk about right now,” Youngkin, the second candidate to speak, began.

It’s the first issue we talked about in our candidacy. Our Election Integrity Taskforce was launched week one. This is not a Republican issue. it’s not a Democrat issue. Now remember: Hillary Clinton complained like crazy ‘they stole the election from me.’ Folks, this is a democracy issue, and we launched right out of the box five steps to restore our trust in our election process. Number one, our Department of Elections will be made independent and transparent. Number two, the voter rolls will be updated every 30 days and if you’ve sadly died or moved away, guess what, you’re not allowed to vote. You will have actually have to show up at every election with a Commonwealth of Virginia photo ID. This is not a controversial — you need one to get a library card in Virginia. If you need a mail-in ballot, you’ll fill out your application and prove you’re a citizen and there will be two signatures when you send it back in. And finally, those voting machines will indeed be tested before and audited within 30 days and it will be made public so everybody will know that this election was fair.

New York Times reporter Trip Gabriel was watching, and live-tweeted the evening’s back-and forths, including Youngkin’s answer, writing:

Ok, so first q for GOP candidates is about what you'll do if Dominion voting machines are used in November general election. ""Will you immediately puruse an independent audit?""@GlennYoungkin says, ""Ladies & gentlemen, this is the most important issue we're going to talk about"" — Trip Gabriel (@tripgabriel) April 27, 2021

The problem with this characterization is while the Republican Women of Greater Virginia cited Dominion voting machines in their question, and some of the candidates referenced Dominion in their answers, Youngkin did not, choosing instead to focus on broader election integrity issues and reforms that aren’t unlike what a number of states have worked to implement over the past 20 years. That kind of answer — one that tackles some of the issues while ignoring others — doesn’t flow naturally; it’s thought-out and it’s intentional.

While the Republican group writing the question had focused on Dominion, worries about voting machine integrity are as old as their introduction, have been asked by both major parties and outside observers, and are important.

But that kind of essential nuance didn’t bother Gabriel, and his mischaracterization was immediately echoed by BlueVirginia.us, a blog run by progressive Virginian Democrats and founded by a professional Democratic consultant. “Excellent job by NY Times reporter Trip Gabriel,” the post began.

Ten days later, Gabriel followed up on his tweets with an article introducing his take on the Virginian Republican candidates for the Times’ loyal readers.

“One candidate brands himself a ‘conservative outlaw,'” Gabriel began the piece, titled “Virginia G.O.P.’s Choices for Governor: ‘Trumpy, Trumpier, Trumpiest.'”

Youngkin, it continued, “asked about Dominion voting machines — the subject of egregious conspiracy theories on the right — called them ‘the most important issue’ of the campaign.”

And he wasn’t finished. Days later, when Youngkin won the nomination, Gabriel inserted his Dominion claim — accented with a completely editorialized accusation that the candidate’s election integrity plan means he “aligned himself with… lies” — into his story on the victory.

At the recent candidates’ forum, Mr. Youngkin aligned himself with Mr. Trump’s lies about a rigged 2020 election, declaring ‘voter integrity’ a top issue and referring to Dominion voting machines — the subject of conspiracy theories on the far right — as ‘the most important issue’ of the campaign. … Although Mr. Youngkin is expected to pivot to reach independent voters, Democrats are sure to remind them in the fall of his most Trumpy declarations from the nominating race

It’s the kind of editorializing that might make sense for the bloggers at BlueVirginia.us, or that the candidates and surrogates of the Democratic Party will try to stick to Youngkin, but in an ethical media world the claim — particularly that Youngkin was “referring to Dominion voting machines” — would earn a newspaper a strong fact-check.

As if. Don’t expect one of those, of course: Facebook and its allies strongly discourage center-right fact-checkers from going after left-wing claims no matter how misleading, and left-wing outlets very rarely go after their friends on the things that actually matter.

In a complete perversion of what would happen in an ethical media world, rather than a fact-check on Gabriel, Youngkin might expect the Times article to be used in some of the cheaper checks that will be deployed against him when he works to push back against the barbs McAuliffe flings on the trail.

It’s the kind of thing Republicans have to deal with every step of the way too, from Kristi Noem and the massive deadly factory outbreak that never happened to Ron DeSantis and the vaccine corruption that also never happened.

This reality isn’t going anywhere, but it’s always good to take a peek at the reporters behind the curtain. These kinds of things aren’t one-offs, they’re how corporate media and the Democratic Party work in tandem to defeat their conservative opponents; seeing how it’s done is just the first step to fighting back.

NYT Stealth Edits Headline Claiming 'Attacks On Jews' Are Bad Because They Help Conservatives,"The New York Times made a title change to an opinion piece published Monday after the original headline insinuated the increasing antisemitic attacks on Jewish people are a “gift” to conservatives.

The op-ed, authored by columnist Michelle Goldberg, has since been re-titled as “The Crisis of Anti-Semitic Violence.” Previously, the title was “Attacks on Jews Over Israel Are A Gift To The Right.”



Goldberg’s article claims the targeting of Jewish people “threatens to undermine progress that’s been made in getting American politicians to take Palestinian rights more seriously.” In other words, the author deducts that rampant anti-Semitism across the country is really only bad because it hurts the left’s anti-Israel causes.

In addition to defending Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who has backed the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement and said Israel is engaging in “terrorism” for retaliating to actual terrorists — Goldberg said Human Rights Watch’s notion that Israel is engaged in apartheid is correct. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., likewise claimed Israel is “promoting racism and dehumanization” and operates under an “apartheid system.”

The Times did not issue a correction or an update on its decision to change the title of Goldberg’s piece, and did not respond to The Federalist’s request for comment.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/05/25/new-york-times-stealth-edits-headline-claiming-attacks-on-jews-are-bad-because-they-help-conservatives/,2021-05-25
"To Defend Its Freedom, Taiwan Must Create A National Guard","Taiwan is a self-ruled democratic republic of almost 24 million people and one of the freest nations on the planet. Unfortunately for Taiwan, it sits some 90 miles away from the People’s Republic of China across the Taiwan Strait.

The 1.4 billion people of the PRC are ruled by the Chinese Communist Party in a one-party totalitarian state under Chairman Xi Jinping. For more than a generation, the PRC has considered Taiwan a renegade province to be retaken, by force if needed.

Over the past two years, Taiwan’s determination to maintain its defenses was boosted as it watched the PRC violate its international agreements promising to maintain Hong Kong’s “One Country, Two Systems” arrangement. This recent absorption of Hong Kong into the PRC with little in the way of consequential international condemnation reaffirmed to Taiwan that Beijing cannot be trusted, while potentially signaling to the CCP it might do the same to Taiwan with fewer negative ramifications than previously anticipated.

Indeed, witnessing Hong Kong’s loss of freedom at the hands of the PRC accelerated a long-term trend of increasing Taiwanese nationalism. Today, 83 percent of Taiwanese, a record high, view themselves as uniquely “Taiwanese” and not “Chinese” or both. Relatedly, 77.6 percent of Taiwanese said they would fight for their freedom should the PRC invade Taiwan.

A willingness to fight and actually fighting are two entirely different things, however. Taiwan’s active-duty military stands at about 165,000 with another 1.7 million reservists. This is down considerably from 2014, when Taiwan’s active force was about 290,000, reflecting a shift away from a reliance on conscripts to an all-volunteer force.

On paper, Taiwan’s reserve strength appears impressive. But it has fundamental weaknesses that render it vulnerable in the most likely scenarios Taiwan may face when defending itself against a vengeful PRC led by the Chinese Communist Party.

Woefully Inadequate Training

In an announcement made three months ago, Taiwan’s military command said it will call up its reservists for two weeks of training every year, but only as a test for 3,000 reservists before a full-scale launch by 2024. Today, a portion of the 770,000 military reservists who left active duty within eight the past years receive only five to seven days of training every other year.

By comparison, in the United States, the 535,000 soldiers in the U.S. Army Reserve and Army National Guard train a minimum of 38 to 39 days a year. Many soldiers serve more than that as they prepare for mobilization or attend specialty and leadership courses. As such, Taiwan’s reservists today receive about 8 percent of the annual training their U.S. Army counterparts. By 2024, if Taiwan’s program to increase training is implemented, Taiwanese reservists will train about 36 percent as much as do American reservists.

This is simply not enough training. When reservists receive well-planned and realistic military training, their proficiency and morale improve. Just as important, when a larger segment of the community — professionals, business people, and workers — are seen preparing to defend the nation, it also galvanizes the public.

To be sure, training and equipment are of vital importance to the effectiveness of a reserve force, yet military doctrine is crucial as well. America has the luxury of strategic depth. Its reserve forces have the gift of time in that most major conflicts requiring their mobilization will develop overseas. This allows for an orderly and considered mobilization and train-up period before deployment.

Taiwan does not have the luxury of time. The PRC can initiate hostilities in minutes, bringing the entirety of Taiwan under intense missile fire and airstrikes. Furthermore, the PRC’s battle plans likely include a focus on Taiwan’s command, control, and communications systems. The ability for Taiwan’s government to call up its reserves and deploy them in a meaningful way will be extremely difficult in a conflict. In short, it is quite doubtful Taiwan’s reserves will provide any militarily significant contribution in the decisive first ten days of battle.

On the contrary, early mobilization of Taiwan’s reserve forces based on intelligence warnings and indicators on an impending PRC attack will be politically problematic. As CCP General Secretary Xi has ordered his military forces to ramp up air and naval operations in and around the Taiwan Strait, the heightened threat posture reduces Taiwan’s reaction time while deadening Taiwan’s military leadership to an imminent attack (something Egypt successfully did to Israel in the six months leading up to the 1973 Yom Kippur War).

Why Reorganizations is Needed

The PRC’s increased operational tempo also produces a “psychological attack” effect against Taiwan. This psychological warfare intends to reduce Taiwan’s will to fight, although the opposite can occur as well as a nation rises to meet the threat.

Were Taiwan’s civilian leadership to consider mobilizing the reserves, there would be tremendous pressure from the island’s business community not to disrupt its workforce or the markets. The political ramifications could be severe as well.

Yet there is a much better way for Taiwan to organize its reserves if Taiwan is willing to have a sharp break from its past. Previously, the Nationalist military from mainland China was viewed by many native Taiwanese as an occupying force at the same time Chiang Kai-shek’s army viewed much of the populace as untrustworthy. Understandably, this led to a system that eschewed local defense organizations since those organizations could become the seeds of rebellion.

Since the sense of Taiwanese identity has grown, the chance of a decentralized reserve system becoming a threat to the government is minimal, although vetting would be needed to prevent PRC sympathizers from gaining operational control of a local Guard unit.

As a result, Taiwan should immediately consider establishing an Army National Guard-like reserve model. As in America, this model would feature local armories housing platoons (40-50 personnel), companies (120 to 200), as well as battalion and brigade headquarters. Frequent training would be conducted in the armories, where virtual training equipment would be located. The facilities would also prove useful in recruiting as well as in responding to natural disasters.

Preparing for the Worst

Each local Taiwan Guard unit would be made responsible for defending key points and infrastructure upon mobilization or at the first sign of an attack by the PRC. Taiwan’s geography has long been assumed to be a force multiplier that favors the defense, something that became increasingly clear during an extensive map exercise and war game I designed for Taiwan as part of my research to write my book, “China Attacks.”

In the event of a surprise attack, Taiwanese Guard soldiers would self-report without orders. Units would be equipped as infantry taskforces with rifles, mortars, antitank missiles, antiaircraft missiles, UAVs, communications gear (including the ability to upload live feeds via satellite), and older armored vehicles.

Even if half these units were to successfully mobilize and take up defensive positions, it would greatly complicate the goal of the People’s Liberation Army to rapidly defeat Taiwan’s active army after a successful amphibious and airborne assault. As a conflict progressed, these local units could be aggregated into larger maneuver units, either as part of the Taiwan Guard or active duty elements.

Due to the growing PRC missile threat, however, an armory’s weapons and equipment would be vulnerable to destruction at the onset of an attack. A solution to this would be to use mobile storage safes or armored carriers.

For instance, rifles would be stored in one container while rifle bolts and ammunition would be stored in the other with separate keys, or combinations, needed to unlock both. This would make it more difficult for the small full-time cadre — typically, two to four personnel — to be overpowered by criminal elements intent on stealing military hardware. At the same time, it would make it nearly impossible for the PRC to destroy the essential equipment of the reserves in the opening moves of an attack.

Lastly, a Taiwan Guard initiative could benefit from an international exchange program started in 1993 as the Cold War ended. The State Partnership Program paired state National Guard commands with counterparts in Central and Eastern Europe.

For instance, during my service as an intelligence officer in the California Army National Guard, I had the opportunity to train with counterparts from Ukraine. Ukraine sent its reservists to California to train and the California Guard sent its Guard members to Ukraine. Furthermore, the use of citizen soldiers in this capacity would be less provocative than an active-duty exchange while at the same time providing confidence to the Taiwanese of the utility of a professionally trained reserve force.

The opening days of a PRC attempt to conquer Taiwan will be critical. Signs of successful resistance, broadcast both internally and internationally, will largely shape the domestic will to fight as well as the international willingness to come to Taiwan’s aid.

If Taiwan survives its encounter with the PRC, the potential for unrest in mainland China would be extreme. A viable Taiwan Guard force would serve as a strong deterrent to the Chinese Communist Party’s aggressive designs aimed at snuffing out Taiwan’s vibrant democracy.

Hate Crimes Against Catholics Are Multiplying (But The Left Doesn't Want To Talk About It),"If you’ve been trapped in an airport, incarcerated abroad, or in some other way been forced to watch CNN over the past few years you may have heard that America is suffering from a surge of “hate crimes.”

A lot of these hate crimes are fake: Nooses that turn out to be garage pulls, bleach attacks that were staged, graffiti that turned out to have been left by the supposed “victim” herself. But there are real hate crimes that take place in America, and the best way to tell they’re real is that the press isn’t talking about them — or isn’t talking about them honestly. But while few may know it, over just the past six weeks America has seen a vicious spate of hate crimes targeting Catholics in the United States.

In the Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn, a vandal hopped the fence surrounding St. Athanasius Church, toppled a beautiful wooden crucifix, shattering it, and then for some reason burned an American flag.

In the nearby Windsor Terrace neighborhood, in the peaceful garden of a church administrative building, a statue of the baby Jesus in his mother’s arms was beheaded.

A week before that, in San Diego, California, three of the century-old stained glass windows in Sacred Heart Catholic Church were shattered, but the vandal wasn’t done: A statue of a kneeling St. Juan Diego, the first indigenous American saint, was decapitated with a stolen fire extinguisher and a dozen other windows were smashed.

One day before that, back in Brooklyn, a statue of Fr. Jerzy Popiełuszko, a Polish martyr beaten to death in 1984 by Communist authorities for daring to stand for freedom, was spray-painted with anti-Polish messages and covered in trash. It wasn’t the first time it had been attacked: In 1990, a vandal spray-painted on the names of Stalin and Lenin, two butchers of the Christian faithful.

On the night of May 2, at St. Charles Borromeo Church in Waltham, Massachusetts, a statue of Christ was decapitated in its church garden.

The Catholic Action League of Massachusetts said when they first started tracking anti-Catholic attacks in the Bay State five years ago, there was about one a year. Since then, they have steadily increased. In the past year, there have been 15 attacks — just in Massachusetts.

In March, there were attacks in Boston, Fort Worth, Texas and Spokane, Washington. In February, in Youngstown, Ohio, Floyds Knobs, Indiana, Denver, Colorado and El Paso, Texas. In January, a statue of Our Lady of Guadalupe — the patron of the Americas and a very important image particularly across Latin America — was shot six times at Houston’s Queen of Peace Catholic Church, there was a graffiti and arson attack on a cathedral in Toledo, Ohio and vulgar Marxist messages scrawled on St. Patrick’s in Manhattan. All told, in the past year there have been at least 67 anti-Catholic attacks nationwide.

The term “hate crime” gets used too often these days. More often enough than not, if you hear the term “hate crime” you can rightly assume it’s an attention-seeking fraud by the loudest “victim” in the room, be they a student at Harvard or an actor in Hollywood.

So why use the term at all? Because the above are crimes committed with the intention of instilling fear among Catholics: To let us know that the Church is not welcome here, to let us all know that Christianity — in its oldest and most visible institution — is not welcome here, and to let you know that God and beauty and morality and freedom and dignity and God’s faithful are a target in your community.

But it’s not just about vandalism and wanton desecration: There’s an even darker aura emanating from our nation’s halls of power. In 2017, when future Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett was first nominated to the Court of Appeals, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein complained that “the dogma lives loudly” within her.

In 2019, President Donald Trump nominated Brian Buescher for a federal court seat. Buescher was, and is, a member of the Catholic men’s organization the Knights of Columbus, and to Sen. Mazie Hirono and then-Sen. Kamala Harris, that made him an extremist, unwelcome in American life.

Harris peppered Buescher with questions about the group. Was he aware, she asked, that the Knights of Columbus are opposed to abortion? Was he aware, she asked, that the Knights of Columbus think marriage involves one biologically male-at-birth man being bound to one biologically female-at-birth woman? Was. He. Aware. That the Knights of Columbus believe in the teachings of the Catholic Church, unchanged for millennia?

According to Hirono, these teachings were “extreme positions” unworthy of a federal judge to hold. Presumably, that means that any sincere Catholic is unfit for any office. And in this new United States that the left is building, that is exactly the case.

It’s especially sinister that this is happening while supposed Catholics hold the nation’s highest offices. Last summer, an Antifa mob in San Francisco ripped down a statue of St. Junipero Serra. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who calls herself a Catholic, ignored the incident. “I’m trying to save the world from coronavirus,” she said when asked on the Feast of St. Serra about the attacks on the religion she pretends to believe and in the district she pretends to represent. Three days later, another mob in Sacramento, California toppled another statue of Serra.

Who was Junipero Serra? He was a missionary who, in the 18th century, traveled from California to Mexico City by foot to plead the case of the American Indians and to protest their mistreatment by Spanish soldiers. It was a perilous journey he took, there and back, to aide a suffering people he dedicated his life to helping.

Pelosi likely knows this. Rewind just a few years, and there’s a photo of then-Speaker of the House John Boehner, Rep. Steve Scalise, and Pope Francis reflecting in front of a Vatican statue to this great man. Who’s standing right next to them in deep reflection? Then-Vice President Joe Biden and then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.

But now, back in power, Pelosi is happy to indulge teenagers, man-children and violent, anti-Catholic bigots who are happy to commit targeted and hateful destruction while claiming it’s all for the benefit of distant indigenous peoples they claim to represent. Neither she nor now-President Biden are hapless bystanders — they’re among the most powerful people in the world.

Trump wasn’t Catholic and never much pretended to be a devout man, but when Catholics were attacked, and when the Christian church across the street from the White House was set ablaze, he spoke up loudly, he stood up to the hateful masked thugs, and he gave leave for enforcement to do the same.

Biden says he’s a Catholic but seems to care about attacks on Catholic symbols and Catholic officials as little as he cares about Catholic beliefs. Search online for then-candidate Biden’s harsh condemnation of the desecration of St. Serra’s statue, its toppling, and the threats to return to break into the church and scatter the saint’s remains into the Pacific Ocean. The only thing you’ll find if you search this is his picture looking solemn for the Vatican photo-op in 2015.

“The devil has changed his tactics,” Msgr. Charles Pope, a Capitol Hill priest and one of the archdiocese’ three exorcists, said in late 2020. “He’s no longer hiding in the shadows.”

It’s a frightening thought, but isn’t surprising. Since 2016, influential members of America’s elite in politics, media, entertainment and business have excused and even encouraged violence in America, and under this elite cover, anti-Christian attacks have multiplied and spread.

Satan isn’t afraid right now, and why would he be? Evil is taught so freely in our society it’s celebrated and those who stand up for innocent life, traditional marriage, the family, man and woman, and Christianity are hated. It makes sense that they’re hated, too: When you live in darkness so long your eyes get used to it, the light burns.

It’s sad, because when people are in need, when legal or illegal immigrants need help, when our communities are suffering from homeless and drugs and hungry, and when people are victimized by bigotry, Catholics are — and have long been — on the the front line.

When Catholic leaders have marched against violence and hate and hunger, politicians have been proud to walk with them. When the clergy gives communion during Mass, politicians have been eager to be seen in line. After all, they like the photos such opportunities provide. But when churches are desecrated, when believers are humiliated, when The Washington Post came after a local D.C. priest for tending his flock during lockdowns, those same politicians lick their fingers, put them in the air, and decide to keep quiet.

It’s Past Time Anthony Fauci Sit In Front Of Bret Baier On Fox News,"One of the last times Anthony Fauci went on Fox News was March 14 when the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) joined Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday.”

That day was long before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lifted recommended restrictions on vaccinated individuals, long before CDC emails showed explicit collusion with teachers unions on school reopenings, long before the Wuhan lab-leak theory emerged as a plausible origin among legacy media, long before Facebook lifted its ban on content pointing to the theory, and long before a treasure trove of Fauci’s personal emails were made public to expose “America’s Doctor” as a political animal who operated in his own self-interest to suppress dissent to his Faucian prescriptions and cover his own possible role in the pandemic itself.

Still, the public deserved real answers about Fauci’s endless back-and-forth recommendations throughout the prior 12 months. Why the endless flip-flopping on masks? Why the endless flip-flopping on schools? Why should the public trust the NIAID director after he admitted to making up numbers for the vaccine threshold needed for herd immunity?

Instead, Wallace’s interview with Fauci included questions such as, “How much of a difference will it make if President Trump leads a campaign for the people who are the most devoted to him to actually go out and get the vaccine?”

Fauci appeared on the network one time after that, still long before any of the items listed above came to fruition, where he faced real questions from Neil Cavuto, who pressed a clearly frustrated Fauci on the idea of masking through 2022 and yearly COVID-19 shots in a brief network interview.

Fauci didn’t appear on the network after that, and once the emails dropped in May, a lot more questions about the NIAID director’s role in funding bat coronavirus research at the Chinese military-collaborative Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) remain to be answered.

Shortly after more than 3,200 pages of emails to and from Fauci’s inbox became public, exposing the government bureaucrat as a dismissive physician who rose to fame to cover his own scandal, the media-savvy politician masquerading as a public health official immediately recalibrated his schedule of press appearances to go on friendly outlets.

According to the temporary co-hosts of The Hill’s YouTube show “Rising,” Federalist Culture Editor Emily Jashinsky and The Intercept’s Ryan Grim, Fauci canceled his scheduled interview on the program set for June 3 the day before. Instead, Fauci went straight to MSNBC for his first post-email scandal interview with Nicolle Wallace, who fawned over the 80-year-old bureaucrat with predictable praise.

“I read through your emails that were released,” Wallace said, emphasizing Fauci passed “the test very few of us would pass” where “the true mark of someone is if they look good even when their personal emails come out.”

MSNBC’s @NicolleDWallace scores the first interview w/ Fauci since his emails were made public and uses it to say: “The true mark of someone is if they look good even when their personal emails come out, so you pass the test very few of us would pass."" pic.twitter.com/SNMXBrXm5v — Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) June 2, 2021

Wallace apparently missed the emails where Fauci dismissed early evidence that COVID-19 came from a Wuhan lab with funding from his own NIAID, disregarded early indications the virus was beyond containment, and contradicted his explanation for discouraging masks early on as merely concerned about their supply for health care workers.

A week later, Fauci gave another interview to MSNBC as calls grew on Capitol Hill for the NIAID director’s firing and a thorough investigation into the Wuhan lab-leak theory, which Fauci had tossed cold water on until late May. The appearance possessed some real Emperor Palpatine “I am the Senate” vibes, characterizing attacks on him as “attacks on science.”

“A lot of what you’re seeing as attacks on me quite frankly are attacks on science because all of the things that I have spoken about consistently from the very beginning have been fundamentally based on science,” Fauci told the network’s Chuck Todd. “So if you are trying to get at me as a public health official and a scientist, you’re really attacking not only Dr. Anthony Fauci, you are attacking science.”

In other words, Fauci himself is “science.” The arrogant, angry tenor of Fauci’s response speaks volumes about the NIAID director who, from the very beginning, capitalized on the Trump Resistance media to manipulate the press into coronating him the arbiter of COVID-19 while intimidating dissenters.

But now, Fauci owes the American people answers. In particular, he owes them to Fox News’ Bret Baier, who remains among the few Beltway journalists who would dare give Fauci a serious, hard-hitting interview.

In an email dated Apr. 17, 2020, Fauci appears to respond to a message from National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Francis Collins under the subject line, “conspiracy gains momentum.” The entire exchange remains redacted except for a Mediaite link to a story on Baier’s reporting that U.S. intelligence sources were increasingly confident that the novel Wuhan coronavirus came from a Chinese lab.

Fauci's response is redacted. pic.twitter.com/G8F7SUB23U — Jason Leopold (@JasonLeopold) June 1, 2021

Instead of sitting before friendly interviewers gushing over their appointed arbiter of science, Fauci owes it to the public to answer real questions from Baier on Fox News.

Why did Fauci dismiss the lab-leak theory for more than 14 months?

What was his response to Collins’ email identifying Baier’s reporting as a “conspiracy”?

Does Fauci, the long-time defender of gain-of-function research who wrote in 2012 it was worth risking a pandemic over, still think it’s a good idea to conduct lab research on viruses that makes them more infectious than they are in the wild? Does he still stand by his 2012 defense of such research?

Does he still think the U.S. should be funding research at overseas labs doing collaborative work with the Chinese military?

Does he regret lying to the public about masks?

What else did he lie about?

Does he regret lying about the possible origins of the virus?

On any given day, how much time did Fauci spend over the course of the pandemic doing media interviews, TV hits, magazine profiles, and book writing?

Does Fauci still trust China to allow for a genuine, transparent investigation of the Wuhan lab into COVID-19’s origin?

Does Fauci still trust the Chinese-dominated World Health Organizatio which botched its first origin probe?

Why did Fauci continue to defend the WHO even after it became clear it was acting in bad faith at the Chinese Communist Party’s behest?

If Fauci were a genuine public health official as opposed to a political hack, he would take questions from all major networks, not just the ones that promise to elevate his status.

House Republicans Call For Censure Of ‘Squad’ Democrats Over Anti-Israel Comments,"Members of the House GOP are seeking to censure Democrat members of the “Squad” who have made inflammatory comments against Israel as the country faces attacks from the terrorist group Hamas and other Islamic groups.

Reps. Mike Waltz of Florida, Claudia Tenney of Florida, and Jim Banks of Indiana put forth a measure Monday calling out far-left Democrats for defending Palestinian groups and egging on antisemitism domestically.

“We cannot turn a blind eye to members of Congress openly defending terrorist attacks by Hamas against our close ally Israel nor their dangerous rhetoric which has contributed to anti-Semitic attacks across the country,” Waltz said, adding that making equivalencies to Israel and the American military is “shameful and should be condemned.”

Democrat Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan have been critical of Israel as it defends itself against terror attacks. There were more than 4,000 rockets fired toward Israel, with hundreds falling in Gaza as well.

Omar claimed in a June House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing that Israel and the U.S. are comparable to Taliban and Hamas and have committed “crimes against humanity.” Likewise, Tlaib said Israel is guilty of “war crimes” and both Ocasio-Cortez and Pressley joined colleagues in calling Israel an “apartheid” state.

House Republicans are also considering whether or not to strip Omar of her committee assignments. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is weighing putting forth a privileged resolution to remove her specifically from the Foreign Affairs Committee. A spokesman for McCarthy declined to comment further on the matter.

“Reps. Omar, Talib, Pressley and Cortez have repeatedly denigrated America and our closest ally. Democrat leadership finally responded to their unhinged comments last week—with a press release,” said Banks. “Actions speak louder than squishy words. Speaker Pelosi can let members vote on our resolution, or she can cover for the Hamas Caucus and their anti-Israel and anti-American rhetoric. We’ll see.”

Twelve Jewish House Democrats released a statement last week condemning Omar for her rhetoric. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrat leadership will not take action against the Minnesota Democrat. Pelosi said “she has a point that she wanted to make and she has a right to make that point.”

Omar has taken the most heat lately. Eight GOP members urged Pelosi in a letter last week to also remove Omar from her committee assignments.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/06/14/house-republicans-call-for-censure-of-squad-democrats-over-anti-israel-comments/,2021-06-14
Biden Gets Played By Vladimir Putin Over Ransomware Attacks,"As President Joe Biden wrapped up his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva, the U.S. leader was played by his Kremlin counterpart who in turn, denied the entire premise of the meeting between the two world powers.

Speaking to reporters after, Biden said the two engaged in productive talks where the American president handed Putin a list of 16 entities “off-limits to attack, period, by cyber or any other means,” after the a ransomware attack which compromised the Colonial Pipeline last month was found to come from Russia. The attack shut down the United States’ largest pipeline for five-days leading to gas outages in 14 states and declared states of emergency in 17.

“So we agreed to task our experts in both our countries to work on specific understandings about what’s off limits, and to follow up on specific cases that originate in either of our countries,” Biden said. “I looked at him and said ‘how would you feel if ransomware took on the pipelines from your oil fields.’ He said it would matter.”

Biden went on to take questions from a list of pre-selected reporters “as usual,” where he claimed the meeting made substantial progress in the bilateral relations with the U.S. and Russia that would, in turn, deter subsequent cyberattacks on American entities.

Putin on the other hand, reportedly left the meeting and again denied any Russian involvement in the ransomware attacks to hit the U.S. in a separate press conference.

“We have to put aside any insinuations,” Putin said, of Russian involvement behind ransomware plaguing American systems. “We know about the cyberattack on the American pipeline … but was does Russia have to do with it?”

After the entire point of the meeting from Biden’s perspective was to establish “guardrails” on peacetime infrastructure attacks, Putin walked out and denied its entire premise.

Biden later lost his temper when CNN’s Kaitlan Collins pressed the president on what made him confidant Putin would change his behavior.

“What do you do all the time?” Biden said, rejecting Collins’ assertion. “When did I say I was confident?”

https://twitter.com/alexsalvinews/status/1405227707714215940?s=20

“Given his past behavior has not changed,” Collins said, “and in that press conference after sitting down with you for several hours, he denied any involvement in cyberattacks, he downplayed human rights abuses, he even refused to say Alexei Navalny’s name, so how does that account to a constructive meeting?”

Biden snapped again before stepping out.

“If you don’t understand that, you’re in the wrong business,” Biden said.

Biden gave Putin the gift of U.S. approval for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany just days after the attack on the Colonial Pipeline in the run-up to the summit. Russian fuel will now flow into the European market and likely erode American energy diplomacy as the Biden administration forfeits new pipelines stateside.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/06/16/biden-gets-played-by-vladimir-putin-on-world-stage-over-ransomware-attacks/,2021-06-16

"Twitter Suspends Nation Of Islam For Being Anti-Vax, But Not Antisemitic","The Nation of Islam, an extremist antisemitic group ran by Louis Farrakhan, was banned from Twitter for criticizing mRNA vaccines. Twitter previously declined to ban Farrakhan’s personal account or the group account for their routine harassment of Jewish people.

Twitter moved to ban the account last week after being targeted for promoting “misinformation.” In reaction to the ban, a high-ranking member in the group tweeted, “Unsurprisingly, Twitter, Inc. has suspended The Nation of Islam’s official account: @OfficialNOI.”

A report cited by the White House this month said that 12 Twitter accounts are responsible for 65 percent of supposed anti-vaccine content. One of the 12 listed was Rizza Islam, a Nation of Islam member. While Twitter took action against the group after perpetual mRNA vaccines criticism, it remained silent on its previous anti-semitism.

A Twitter spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.

https://twitter.com/InezFeltscher/status/1419717882125107206

Nation of Islam has a history of attacking Jews and making incendiary comments. Farrakhan said at a speech in 2018, “the powerful Jews are my enemy” and “white folks are going down. And Satan is going down. And Farrakhan, by God’s grace, has pulled the cover off of that Satanic Jew and I’m here to say your time is up, your world is through.”

In 2018, Farrakhan tweeted a video clip of a speech where he compared Jews to termites and called them stupid. He captioned the video: “I’m not an anti-Semite. I’m anti-Termite.”

Even though his tweet violated Twitter’s policy around “dehumanizing” tweets, which specifically includes “comparing groups to animals and viruses (animalistic),” a Twitter spokesperson told BuzzFeed News the rules were not yet taken effect at the time of the tweet, so Farrakhan’s language was not in violation of any extant policy. Farrakhan is still on the platform as of this writing.

Several Democrats have previously held ties to the radical group, such as House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., who was on a stage in 2011 with Farrakhan. In 2018, Rep. Danny Davis, D-Ill., called Farrakhan “an outstanding human being” who “does outstanding things.”

Another notable Farrakhan ally is Democrat Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, who said in 2013 his group’s “voice has been important for the development of Black theology.” Warnock’s office did not respond to a request for comment.

The black nationalist group and its leader frequently tweet offensive content. Farrakhan once said, “The FBI has been the worst enemy of Black advancement” and “The Jews have control over those agencies of government.”",https://thefederalist.com/2021/07/26/twitter-suspends-nation-of-islam-for-attacking-vaccines-but-not-attacking-jews/,2021-07-26
"German Police Brawl With Anti-Lockdown Protesters, Amid Growing Opposition To COVID Mandates","Thousands of German civilians protested new government COVID-19 lockdowns and vaccine passports across 13 separate demonstrations in Berlin on Sunday. Local authorities had banned such weekend protests, but countless Germans refused to be forced into silence and proceeded to demonstrate anyways, causing German authorities to deploy approximately 2,000 police officers onto Berlin’s streets in riot gear.

Over a year into lockdowns, Germany requires that individuals show vaccine passports, proof of recovery from COVID-19 or proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test, in order to dine indoors or book a hotel room, among other activities.

According to video footage obtained on Twitter, Berlin police officers brawled with anti-lockdown civilians, who have grown tired of tyrannical rules, throughout Berlin’s streets.

Police told the press that they were “harassed and attacked,” while protesters allegedly ignored roadblocks. Video footage shows both law enforcement and civilians initiating confrontations, which many establishment media outlets omitted.

Police detained protesters, but the crowds kept marching from Berlin’s Charlottenburg neighborhood toward Brandenburg Gate. Around 600 protesters were detained in total, while the police used irritants and batons to try to quell the crowds.

In one instance, a 49-year-old man collapsed and died, shortly after breaking through a street barrier. According to The Guardian, his cause of death is still unknown.

Is Germany Spying on Anti-Lockdown Groups?

Among other demonstrations, local authorities preemptively banned the Querdenker movement, the “most visible anti-lockdown movement in Germany,” according the Associated Press, from organizing a protest over the weekend. The movement has gathered thousands of Germans from across the political spectrum to challenge the government’s mandates. They view the government’s response to COVID as being fascistic and condemn vaccine mandates as a modern form of apartheid.

The German government sees the Querdenker movement as a threat to its power. Not only has Germany limited its citizens’ speech when it comes to protesting COVID-19 mandates, but the BBC recently reported that Germany’s domestic intelligence service is spying on members of the Querdenker movement, “amid concerns [that] they may be trying to delegitimize the state” and that their opinions could be dangerous to the status quo.

AP reports the movement includes “those opposing vaccinations, coronavirus deniers, conspiracy theorists and right-wing extremists.” However, the Querdenker movement’s founder, Michael Ballweg, vehemently rejects this portrayal of his group, arguing that “[he and his colleagues] are a peaceful movement and not a political party.”

Members of the German elite nonetheless find Ballweg’s movement threatening. Germany’s Parliament President Wolfgang Schäuble recently mouthed off about protesters, suggesting they should let the experts do all the thinking.

“If practically all experts worldwide say the coronavirus is dangerous and vaccination helps, then who actually has the right to say, ‘Actually, I’m smarter than that?’” Schäuble asked. “To me, that is an almost unbearable level of arrogance.”

Schäuble’s rhetoric does not appear to have put his people at ease, and more demonstrations in Germany are planned.

Global Opposition to COVID-19 Mandates

The German people aren’t the only ones to challenge their government’s COVID policies. For the third weekend in a row of protests, over 200,000 individuals gathered in France on Saturday to challenge their country’s vaccine mandates. The weekend prior, over 80,000 frustrated civilians similarly protested in Italy.

Such protests have persisted for weeks. As Federalist intern Shawn Fleetwood recently reported, civilians have challenged forced lockdowns and vaccine passports everywhere from Australia and France, to Italy and the United Kingdom.

Protesters in Sydney, Australia recently chanted “freedom,” while holding signs with quotations like “unmask the truth” and “no forced vaccines, no vax passports.” In France, tens of thousands of protesters gathered on July 24, with some of them shouting “Liberty! Liberty!” on Bastille plaza. Italian citizens recently gathered across Italy to protest the country’s vaccine passports, with many of them chanting “Freedom” and “Down with the dictatorship.”

One U.K. protester recently told Breitbart News that, “The vaccine passport system is the final straw, it’s the thin edge of the wedge. …Deaths have dropped, people are getting vaccinated, and in theory, that’s supposed to protect us, and here we still are.”

“I see no end to it, they are never going to let go of the powers that they have stolen, they are loving it too much,” she lamented.

The people of Slovakia, Ireland, and Greece, among others, have also pushed back strongly against vaccine passports.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/08/02/german-police-brawl-with-anti-lockdown-protesters-amid-growing-opposition-to-covid-mandates-across-europe/,2021-08-02
"Canada’s Top Anti-Lockdown Politician Fights Leftist Media, Political Right","Canadian anti-lockdown politician Max Bernier is doing something that’s now illegal in the Great White North: standing up for freedom. Bernier is currently on his pre-election Mad Max Tour, with a Canadian election possible as early as this fall.

“We are under attack by the Trudeau Liberal government, under attack also by the mainstream media, under attack by the radical leftists, under attack by the woke, and under attack – it’s sad to say – by the Conservative Party of Canada that is not conservative anymore,” Bernier said recently at a rally in the small city of Duncan, British Columbia.

When Bernier says “under attack,” it’s not just rhetoric. He recently appeared on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” following his arrest in June in Manitoba for trying to go speak to supporters at an outdoor rally. He was charged with exceeding public gathering limits and violating Manitoba’s requirement to self-isolate upon entering the province.

Throughout the West, Bureaucrats Limit Liberty

Bernier’s warnings apply to citizens throughout the West, from America to Italy: Power-hungry bureaucrats and lying insiders are trying to strangle our economy and liberties under the new COVID regime. Bernier’s situation is very similar to that of former President Trump. He faces a deranged leftist media spreading lies, an establishment conservative party that’s all talk and no action, and an overbearing leftist culture and administrative state that seeks to crush all opposition.

For another thing, “Mad Max” is a definite underdog, mocked and dismissed by most of the “respectable” pundits and analysts. Large swathes of Bernier’s base support President Trump, and – like Trump – he’s broken through the left-right divide via something akin to national populism fueled by anti-elite energy.

In an interview before his Duncan rally, Bernier said he admires Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and past leaders like Britain’s Margaret Thatcher for standing up to tyrannical leftist ideologies.

“Socialism is everywhere. In school, in journalism – we don’t have journalists anymore, we have leftist activists,” Bernier warned. “We need to wake up.”

When Bernier slams Canada’s establishment “Conservative” party, he also knows what he’s talking about. Like Americans who warned for years about RINOs (Republicans in Name Only), Bernier has been sounding the alarm over fake conservatives for years, saying they’re against freedom and don’t care enough about the national interest. Sound familiar?

Why Bernier Split from the Conservative Party

Bernier split off from Canada’s so-called “Conservative Party” over ideological differences in 2018 and formed the People’s Party of Canada. Basically he realized the party was just going to toe the leftist line while expressing token objections.

Bernier wanted actual action and a right-leaning alternative for Canadians, not just talk and stuffed suits on TV. Informed by libertarian populist beliefs and a Canada First platform, he is gaining increasing momentum across Canada for speaking up against the draconian lockdowns, vaccine passports, and the current authoritarian trend of Canada’s progressive government under United Nations-worshipping Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

The People’s Party of Canada did not win any seats in Parliament in the 2019 election and support is nowhere near the level of the MAGA movement – not yet anyway – but things can change fast. Bernier believes the most important thing Canadians and Westerners must do is educate themselves.

“First, educate yourself. Second, fight and speak to your friends and family,” he said.

According to Bernier, Western liberals want to bring a Chinese Communist-style system to our nations and crack down on all the most basic liberties, including freedom of assembly and medical choice. Canada’s far-left corporate and government-run media have both falsely implied that Bernier is a political extremist and racist, and a defamation lawsuit is currently proceeding against Canadian pundit Warren Kinsella. Canada’s groupthink media has slammed Bernier for his desire to not sign the UN migration compact and to cap immigration at the very reasonable and high amount of 150,000 people per year.

Lockdowns Led to More Deaths of Under 65 than COVID Did

With overdoses, despair, and crushed small businesses during its long lockdowns, the trajectory that Canada is on should worry Americans because the United States is unfortunately on a similar path under the medical regime of Anthony Fauci and crew.

Sixteen months of Canada’s ultra-strict lockdowns have been an utter disaster. In fact, lockdowns appear to have killed more Canadians under 65 than COVID-19 , according to provisional government statistics.

From the end of March 2020 to the beginning of April 2021, there were 5,535 “excess” deaths than expected without a pandemic. Over that period, 1,380 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19 in those younger than 65. That suggests “that the excess mortality is, in large part, related to other factors such as increases in the number deaths attributed to causes associated with substance use and misuse, including unintentional (accidental) poisonings and diseases and conditions related to alcohol consumption,” according to Statistics Canada.

“Thousands have died from the knock-on effects of lockdowns, with thousands more projected to die,” Canadian journalist Tristin Hopper noted. “Between April and December of 2020, 5,148 Canadians died of an overdose, a rise of 89 percent over the same period in 2019” and “in Quebec, the province’s health ministry has estimated that up to 4,000 people have gone undiagnosed with cancer as a result of a sharp dropoff in mammograms, pap smears and colorectal cancer screens,” according to Hopper.

Economically, “downtown cores have been gutted, and a significant share of small businesses aren’t coming back.” The closure of the Canadian border to Americans and requirement of incoming Canadians from abroad to quarantine at hotels for a week for up to $2,000 of their own money has also been widely panned.

Bernier wants to get the word out and let people know the facts. If what Bernier calls the “globalists” take over, he believes Canada and the West could end up in a nightmare scenario including forced vaccinations and stricter censorship.

“I’m fighting against globalism, against these policies. For me, I believe in Canada, I believe in Canadian sovereignty. I don’t want the UN or any international organization to impose their vision on us,” Bernier said.

Video Shows Manhattan Hatchet Attack On 51-Year-Old Man Using ATM,"Warning: This article contains graphic material.

Surveillance footage obtained by the New York Post shows a masked man walking into a bank in Manhattan and attacking a customer with a hatchet.

The attack occurred inside a Chase Bank in New York City’s Financial District on Tuesday. In the video, which the Post obtained on Tuesday, a man pulled a hatchet from a bag and targeted another man.

After the first blow, the bloodied victim tried to evade the attacker, shifting around the room. Upon beating the man several times, the unidentified attacker smashed the cash-dispensing machines and left his bag and hatchet on the floor. Police confirmed to the Post that the weapon was left behind.

“A man was there with a hatchet and [hit] my head … and my leg,” the victim told the Post while reportedly “dazed” and “with his head wrapped in a large bandage.”

Police arrested a man, 37, who matched the description of the attacker at 10:00 p.m. on Tuesday after they caught him breaking car windows, according to sources who spoke to the Post.

Ryan Girdusky, a New Yorker and the author of “They’re Not Listening: How The Elites Created the National Populist Revolution,” told The Federalist it is time for Democrats to get serious about fighting crime.

“Crime in this city is getting worse, but it’s also becoming more brutal,” Girdusky said. “People are detached from their humanity. We need more than just restoring our police budgets and undoing Cuomo’s bail reform.”

Back in May, Democrat New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Manhattan’s three biggest problems are “crime, crime, [and] crime.” The remarks came amid a 73 percent increase in shootings and a 47 percent spike in robberies, according to data from the New York Police Department.

Cuomo has been roundly condemned for his bail reform policy that has closed correctional facilities and led to criminals being pardoned. In his final days as governor, the Democrat granted clemency to 10 felons, including three people linked to murders.

After the murder of George Floyd last year, Democrats across the country moved to defund the police, with New York slashing about $1 billion. But like other increasingly crime-ridden cities, New York City pivoted, with lawmakers moving to add $200 million to the budget in June. Democrat Mayor Bill de Blasio and City Council Speaker Corey Johnson, however, hailed the move as “targeted investments to break the cycle of incarceration and reduce gun violence.” The budget did not include more money for hiring officers.

The situation has become so stressful for police that the city hired therapy dogs, according to the Washington Post.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/08/18/graphic-video-shows-heinous-manhattan-hatchet-attack-on-51-year-old-man-using-atm/,2021-08-18
"In Hopeless Speech, Biden Refuses Liability For His Afghanistan Crisis","After delaying addressing the nation for most of the day, President Joe Biden is still avoiding the liability for the Afghanistan crisis and the deaths that have occurred during evacuation efforts.

In his White House speech, Biden called the at least 12 U.S. service members who were killed in the explosions heroes but spent minutes comparing the loss of his son Beau Biden to cancer to the pain his administration’s incompetence has caused military families.

Biden claimed he was “outraged” at the situation and attack, which took more than 100 lives, but only repeated lies and deflected blame for his botched withdrawal that caused the American evacuation crisis which he celebrated last week as being death-free.

“Those who carried out this attack and anyone who wishes America harm know this, we will not forgive,” Biden said. “We will not forget. We will hunt you down to make you pay. I will defend our interests and our people with every measure at my command.”

Biden previously promised that “any attack on our forces or disruption of our operations at the airport will be met with swift and forceful response” but made no formal commitment to use force against ISIS-K until after his commanders draw up plans.

BIDEN LAST WEEK: ""Any attack on our forces or disruption of our operations at the airport will be met with swift and forceful response."" pic.twitter.com/chiPr7LPou — Benny (@bennyjohnson) August 26, 2021

BREAKING: Pres. Biden says he's ordered his commanders ""to develop operational plans to strike ISIS-K assets, leadership and facilities."" ""We will respond with force and precision at our time, at the place we choose and the moment of our choosing."" https://t.co/aVzjnzGos5 pic.twitter.com/kTw6VbCCSA — ABC News (@ABC) August 26, 2021

U.S. evacuation efforts, the president said, will continue because “Americans will not be intimidated” but he could only commit to rescuing “as many Americans out as possible” instead of the approximately 1,500 U.S. citizens still stranded in Afghanistan.

“There are, will be I believe numerous opportunities to continue to provide access for additional persons to get out of Afghanistan, either through means that we provide and or are provided through in cooperation with the Taliban,” Biden said.

Shortly after, he claimed that there were no historical examples of conflicts that ended successfully with everyone being removed safely.

“As a student of history, no conflict, where, when a war was ending, one side was able to guarantee that everyone that wanted to be extracted from that country would get out,” Biden said.

United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson and former President Trump were just a few of the people who condemned the ISIS-K attack before the president issued any statement or gave a speech on Thursday.

Joe Biden Is Unfit To Lead. He Should Be Impeached.,"Joe Biden is not capable or competent to hold the office of the presidency. If there were any doubt on this point, his press conference Thursday evening in the wake of a pair of coordinated suicide bombings in Kabul should put the matter to rest.

The first blast Thursday killed 13 U.S. soldiers at a Kabul airport gate, along with scores of Afghans. Another bomb at a nearby hotel killed dozens more. Between the two blasts, as many as 170 people perished, not counting the U.S. service members. Hundreds more were injured, and according to U.S. officials there may be more attacks coming.

Whatever the final body count is, Thursday was the deadliest day for U.S. troops in Afghanistan since 2011, and the first time since February 2020 that any U.S. service members have been killed in action there. When the smoke finally clears, one thing is certain: Biden has been derelict in his duty, he is unfit to lead, and he should be impeached.

At his press conference Thursday evening, the president was slow and appeared at times to be confused, his answers rambling and unclear. When the time came to take questions, he said he’d been given a list, and had “been instructed” to call on certain reporters. It was a moment of quiet dread when we all saw confirmed again, before a gaping world, that although Biden is the president, he’s not actually running the country.

Joe Biden: ""They gave me a list here. The first person I was instructed to call on…” pic.twitter.com/1BHTRXyvSa — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) August 26, 2021

Of course Biden’s bizarre behavior at the press conference, although deeply disturbing, does not alone justify impeachment. Rather, it’s his fecklessness and incompetence, his failure to protect Americans in the evacuation of Afghanistan, and his inability to speak clearly and honestly about the situation, that justifies impeachment at this point.

Throughout this crisis, Biden and his White House have been evasive, defensive, and cruelly indifferent to a disaster entirely of their own making. The bare minimum for a commander in chief in this scenario is to be clear and forthright with the American people about what it will take to get Americans out safely, and what will happen if we can’t get them out by the August 31 deadline. Instead, the Biden administration has blamed Donald Trump, ducked questions, stonewalled, and generally contributed to the deadly chaos still unfolding in Afghanistan.

Indeed, what this means for the ongoing evacuation is unclear. It might well be over, at this point. News reports out of Kabul indicate the U.S. military is welding shut the gates of the airport complex, which could mean an abrupt end to evacuation efforts for an estimated 1,500 American citizens, at least, still trapped in Afghanistan.

If that is the case, we are now facing the worst hostage crisis in American history.

Our sources on the ground tell us gates are being welded shut. https://t.co/Fj9u5Up9b4 — Howard Altman (@haltman) August 26, 2021

Some of our allies have already acknowledged as much. On Thursday, many of our North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies announced they were ending evacuation efforts, frankly conceding they are leaving behind citizens still stranded in and around Kabul.

In a press briefing Thursday, Gen. Kenneth Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, said he expects these attacks to continue but that the U.S. military will press on with its evacuation mission. It’s unclear, though, what that will look like, given what’s happened and the likelihood it will happen again before the military can get American citizens, to say nothing of U.S. soldiers and equipment, out of Kabul.

For much of the day on Thursday, Biden was again absent and the White House silent. Hours before the president addressed the nation, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke about the attack in Kabul. David Marcus rightly noted how disturbing it was that the British prime minister would speak publicly about the attack before the U.S. president did.

Why am I hearing about the loss of American military lives from the Prime Minister of the UK but not the American president? What the hell is going on? https://t.co/hCUhnAG08W — David Marcus (@BlueBoxDave) August 26, 2021

Indeed, five hours after the attacks on Thursday, the only public communication from the White House was a statement about the celebration of “Women’s Equality Day.”

The administration’s silence continues to be matched by its incompetence. Later on Thursday, Politico reported that U.S. officials in Kabul gave the Taliban a list of names of American citizens, green card holders, and Afghan allies to grant entry into the airport complex, a move that sparked outrage among lawmakers and military officials. “Basically, they just put all those Afghans on a kill list,” one defense official told Politico. “It’s just appalling and shocking and makes you feel unclean.”

Even before the deadly attacks on Thursday, Sen. Lindsay Graham this week called for Biden’s impeachment, citing “dereliction of duty by the commander-in-chief.” Graham is of course a foreign policy neocon who, if he had his way, would continue the war in Afghanistan in perpetuity. But Republican calls for Biden’s impeachment or resignation swelled to a chorus after the Thursday attacks, and rightly so.

Some on the right will protest that impeaching Biden will only give us President Kamala Harris, thrusting from the frying pan into the fire. Maybe so. But at least a President Harris would know what was going on and could be held answerable for it. At least we would know who’s running the country.

Some will also object that any impeachment, given the state of American politics, will perforce be merely political, or be seen as such by half the country. Maybe so. But unlike Democrats’ two impeachments of former President Donald Trump, impeaching Biden over his Afghanistan disaster isn’t about political theater. Recall that Trump was impeached the first time for a perfectly legitimate phone call, and the second time for giving an innocuous speech to his supporters.

The impeachment of Biden, by contrast, would be about basic competence and confidence and Biden’s ability to execute his sworn duties as president. He has shown that he is unfit and incompetent. Now Congress should do its duty, and impeach him.

23-Year-Old Marine Days Before She Died In Kabul Attack: 'I Love My Job',"Marine Sgt. Nicole Gee, 23, was assigned to help with evacuation efforts in Kabul, specifically with civilian women and children as they fled the Taliban takeover. On Aug. 20 Gee shared a photo on Instagram of her cradling an infant in her arms with the caption, “I love my job.” She was killed six days later in the ISIS-K bombing attack at Kabul airport.

The Department of Defense shared the same photo days before the attack, tweeting “U.S. military service members comfort infants at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan.”

From Roseville, California, Gee was a maintenance technician stationed in North Carolina in the Marines’ Combat Logistics Battalion 24. Less than a month ago, she was promoted to Sergeant.

Gee shared another photo of herself in Kabul “escorting evacuees onto the bird” on her Instagram last week.

“How her last breath was taken doing what she loved—helping people—at HKIA in Afghanistan. Then there was an explosion. And just like that, she’s gone,” wrote Sgt. Mallory Harrison, a fellow Marine and Gee’s roommate, in a Facebook post:

You know it can happen. And you train to be ready if/when it does. You’re ready. Gung-Ho. You raise your hand for all of the deployments, you put in the work. But it’s hard to truly relate to those stories when most of the deployments nowadays involve a trip to Oki or a boring 6 months on ship. Then bad people do bad things, and all of a sudden, the peaceful float you were on turns into you going to Afghanistan & for some, never coming back. It turns into your friends never coming home. Nicole was married to another U.S. Marine, Jarod Gee. Nicole’s sister, Misty Fuoco, described the couple’s bond as “unmatched” and “a bond like nothing I’ve ever see,” on a GoFundMe page for the family. “She gave the ultimate sacrifice. We will forever be changed and forever hurt with her absences but I know she wouldn’t have had it any other way, she absolutely loved the work she was doing in Afghanistan and was excited to tell me more about it once she was back home,” Fuoco wrote.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/08/30/23-year-old-marine-days-before-she-was-killed-in-kabul-attack-i-love-my-job/,2021-08-30
Will China Move On Taiwan Now And Risk War With America?,"When the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) decides to quash the island nation of Taiwan’s successful run at democratic self-governance, will the Chinese try to limit the conflict to Taiwan and its immediate waters, or will they immediately embark on a wider conflict involving the United States, Japan, and other nations? It’s a big question. History suggests an answer.

Before answering that question, we need to understand why China would seek to occupy Taiwan in the first place. The CCP, under the leadership of General Secretary Xi Jinping, sees Taiwan as part of China. But, as with Hong Kong, the CCP cannot tolerate any challenge to its totalitarian control. For the CCP, the maintenance of its rule is paramount.

More so than Hong Kong, Taiwan’s continued development as an independent and flourishing democracy with robust human rights threatens the very foundation of the CCP’s legitimacy. Where Hong Kong was an annoying challenge to Beijing’s rule, Taiwan is a mortal threat. Taiwan — specifically its form of government — must be destroyed. “Taiwan delenda est!”

Taiwan’s conquest also offers a second important consideration: its geographic location. With Taiwan in China’s possession, China’s rapidly expanding fleet will have a far greater ability to project power and threaten Japan, the nations of Southeast Asia, and the United States.

Thus, there are both domestic and strategic reasons for the CCP to order its armed forces to conquer Taiwan. When this war comes, will the CCP try to keep the conflict confined to Taiwan, or will it strike out broadly, seeking to preempt Japanese and U.S. forces that might attempt to come to Taiwan’s assistance?

History Offers Clues on China’s Possible Moves

Looking at the opening moves of past conflicts provides clues. Had diplomacy or rational analysis been applied — though, admittedly, with the clarity of 20-20 hindsight — rather than pride, fear, and inertia, it could have significantly changed the course of history.

In the First World War, imperial Germany’s decision to invade France via Belgium in response to war in the Balkans between Serbia and their Austro-Hungarian allies is faulted by historians and strategists for triggering the United Kingdom’s entry into the war against Germany.

Why did Germany attack France when its initial threat was Russia to the east? The main reason was that planners in the German General Staff calculated Russia was too large to be defeated quickly. Thus, France needed to be knocked out first in a quick blow — as happened in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, when France was defeated in six months.

What might have been a regional war between Austria-Hungary and Serbia following the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand on June 28, 1914, took an ominous turn when Russia ordered the mobilization of its army in late July. Germany declared war on Russia two days later, with France ordering mobilization the same day. Two days after that, Germany declared war on France.

The French frontier with Germany is short and the terrain favors defense. German planners calculated that the only way to win quickly was to march through Belgium and Luxembourg, risking a British declaration of war. This occurred the following day, largely dooming Germany to defeat.

The other issue was the pre-war planning by the German General Staff. Having gone all-in on trying to repeat the spectacular victory of 1870, German planners created an intricate mobilization schedule that made maximum use of their rail network to move troops to the western front for the knockout blow against France. There was no Plan B to hold the line against France in Alsace-Lorraine while focusing the bulk of the German effort against Russia.

Discounting diplomatic considerations, German war planning was solely driven by military considerations of time, space, and force — France, first and quickly, then Russia.

Similarly, many analysts believe the People’s Republic of China (PRC) would seek to attack only Taiwan during an effort to seize the island. This assumes the PRC believes it could successfully deter the United States and Japan from coming to Taiwan’s aid. But deterrence can’t be ensured. Thus, the PRC will likely have to assume that both the United States and Japan will act to prevent Taiwan’s conquest. As with German war planners in 1914, the PRC cannot assume it can choose its opponents.

World War II Parallels

A generation later, Nazi-led Germany’s attack on Poland in 1939 after securing the Soviet Union’s acquiescence with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and subsequent attack on France in May 1940, bested the 1870 war by forcing a French armistice in only 46 days. Thus, Germany in 1939 made successful use of diplomacy to ensure a one-front war through June 1941, when Germany invaded the Soviet Union.

In the PRC’s case, it has successfully allied with Russia, but in a largely naval contest in the Pacific, Russian assistance will be limited. Beyond Russia, it’s hard to imagine the PRC pulling off a diplomatic coup of the massive consequence of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. With whom would they strike a deal? Japan? India? The United States?

Imperial Japan’s decision to attack the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, and the oil and resource-rich British and Dutch colonies, came in response to U.S. economic embargoes on Japan. The U.S. demanded Japan give up its imperial ambitions or face a debilitating loss of American oil exports.

Japanese war planners hoped to defeat U.S. naval forces piecemeal, first destroying the Pacific Fleet, then the Atlantic Fleet as it was sent to reinforce. Then, the Japanese hoped, the prospect of a long and bloody slog across the Pacific would force the Americans to sue for peace. Japanese planners saw Americans as effete and too wed to material comforts to stomach the prospect of years of fighting against the spiritually superior Japanese.

Japanese planners also knew time was not on their side. America’s massive industrial advantage — about six-fold that of Japan’s — ensured that as time went on, Japan’s prewar naval parity would shrink rapidly.

Japanese war planners, like Germany’s leading up to 1914, appeared to give scant consideration to diplomacy. Their desire to expand their empire in China and recently seized French Indochina meant that they would never agree to U.S. demands to abandon their ambitions. Thus, with the decision to fight already made, the only remaining choices were how to carry out the conflict.

Japan’s Total War Research Institute presented war studies to the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy and by August 1941 a general strategy had been agreed upon from four choices — all looking at the sequence by which the Philippines, Malaya, Borneo, Java, and Sumatra would be taken. Of note, two of the plans involved delaying the effort to seize the Philippines, then a U.S. commonwealth, preferring instead to take the Dutch Indies or British Malaya first.

In both cases, the threat of U.S. intervention, using its bases in the Philippines to cut off Japanese supply routes, was deemed too high a risk. As a result, attacking American interests at the onset — and overwhelming them — was considered the safest course of action.

As with Japan in 1941, the PRC must have secure maritime access to import oil and raw materials from the nations contiguous to the South China Sea. The sole significant factor in this historical analogy that appears to fail is the issue of time. Japan was running out of time while the PRC seems to have time on its side.

The Advantages of Patience

Measured in purchasing power parity, the PRC’s economy is increasingly larger than the U.S. economy. The PRC is engaged in a massive naval buildup, launching more naval tonnage than the United States and Japan combined are willing or able to produce. To top it off, the PRC is quadrupling its strategic nuclear force and may build substantially more nuclear missiles.

If the CCP so decides, it might simply wait until it has a substantial advantage over the combination of Taiwan, the United States, and Japan.

The PRC’s rapid and sustained modernization of its military forces, combined with greatly increased training, suggests that if the CCP so decides, it might simply wait until it has a substantial advantage over the combination of Taiwan, the United States, and Japan. If so, the CCP could move on Taiwan at a time of its choosing (sometime after 2026), while warning Japan and the United States to stay out of the fight — or else.

The risk of doing so is that deterrence only works if the enemy is deterred. In other words, China can lay the groundwork for deterrence through strength, but it is up to leaders in Japan and the United States to decide if they are, in fact, deterred from intervening on Taiwan’s behalf.

Alternatively, the PRC might seek to use diplomacy or subversive political pressure to sideline Japan or the United States, although such actions are hardly guaranteed.

China May Not Want to Wait

But several considerations make it less likely the CCP will want to wait to conquer Taiwan when it has a massive advantage. First, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the Central Military Commission Xi is 68 years old. He is ruthlessly ambitious and has been building a cult of personality to rival Mao’s. Xi will not want to leave the conquest of Taiwan to his successor.

Second, every year that passes sees Taiwan develop more and more of its own unique culture and political traditions. Young Taiwanese are more likely than ever to see themselves as Taiwanese rather than Chinese.

In 1992, Taipei’s National Chengchi University poll found that 18% of people on Taiwan thought of themselves as Taiwanese, 26% as Chinese, and 46% as both. By 2008, views of national identity shifted to 45% seeing themselves as Taiwanese, 45% both Chinese and Taiwanese, and 4% as Chinese-only. The latest poll, in December of last year, saw Taiwanese-only identity reaching 64%, with both at 30% and Chinese-only at 3%.

Further, to the degree that the CCP claims Taiwan as inalterably a part of China, it begs the question — if the Taiwanese (who are said by the CCP to be Chinese) can thrive under democracy, why can’t the Chinese people too? This is at the heart of the legitimacy threat posed by Taiwan.

Xi will not want to leave the conquest of Taiwan to his successor.

In addition, America’s massive loss of face in Afghanistan and the perception that President Joe Biden’s decision-making abilities are in serious doubt could contribute to the CCP deciding to move sooner, rather than later.

Thus, Xi’s mortal timeline and Taiwan’s steady drift away from China — and the moral threat its democracy presents to the mainland Communists — suggests war may come sooner rather than later. If so, expect the PRC to conduct an aggressive first strike, hitting Taiwan, Japan, and the United States simultaneously and with surprise.

This attack would likely include missile strikes on Guam, Hawaii, Okinawa, the Japanese Home Islands, and even cyberattacks on key U.S. infrastructure. China’s intent would be four-fold: to preempt forces that could help Taiwan and prolong its defense; to destroy foreign ability to come to Taiwan’s rescue; to demoralize foreign adversaries, causing them to sue for peace; and to set the stage for a globe-dominating Chinese empire led by the Chinese Communist Party.

As with imperial Japan’s overreach in 1941, China’s coming attack on Taiwan will sow the seeds of the CCP’s destruction by a coalition of nations fearing subjugation by Beijing.

11 Attacks Have Proved Less A Threat To America Than The Left,"I was in college when the planes hit the towers, studying that Tuesday morning before class in the student union. The woman who ran the student snack bar and I were the only people there, and together we watched the second plane hit on live TV.

At that moment, my stomach dropped. After the first plane hit, no one really knew what was going on, whether a small aircraft had accidentally crashed into the tower or if it had been an explosion or something else. But when that second plane hit, we knew. This wasn’t an accident. Someone had planned this. It was an attack. Suddenly, we were at war.

In the months and years that followed, my classmates and I tried to wrap our minds around what we thought was coming: a generational struggle against jihadist networks that seemed to span the globe, that had even infiltrated the United States. We all read Samuel P. Huntington’s “The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of the World Order.” We all scoffed at Francis Fukuyama’s notion of the “end of history.” We thought the United States was the only power capable of stamping out Islamic terrorism. We assumed there would be many more attacks on the homeland.

Twenty years after the attacks of September 11, 2001, it’s safe to say they did not herald the defining, all-consuming civilizational struggle we had anticipated. The thing we most feared, Islamic terrorism, did not prove to be our worst enemy or the greatest threat to our republic. The real enemy, it turns out, came from within.

In the 20 years since the attacks, America’s own totalitarian left has proven to be a far more dangerous and committed enemy of the United States than any distant jihadists, harboring as much hatred for our heritage of freedom and chaotic way of life as Osama bin Laden ever did.

Christopher Hitchens famously described bin Laden’s animating ideology as, “fascism with an Islamic face,” later adopting the apt term, “Islamofascism.” Hitchens thought the fascist comparison appropriate because both movements, in his view, are murderous cults, hostile to modernity and the life of the mind, nostalgic for empires of past glory, and obsessed with past humiliations and a desire for revenge, among other things.

But the fascism of bin Laden and his ilk, while obviously dangerous (and likely to become more so after our utter defeat in Afghanistan), hasn’t proved as durable or tangible as the fascism of the Democratic Party under the Biden administration.

As I write, the president is announcing a plan to force all federal workers to get a COVID-19 shot, and major employers to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for their workers or test them weekly, with crippling fines for those who don’t comply.

“This is not about freedom or personal choice,” said Biden. Indeed it’s not. It’s about total federal control over what the administrative state has come to view as its subjects, not citizens to whom it must answer. In the tyrannical worldview of the president and his advisors, nothing can stand in the way of government coercion, not even federalism. “If these governors won’t help,” said Biden, “I will use my powers as president and get them out of the way.”

Bin Laden, who correctly foresaw disaster and eventual defeat for the invading Americans in Afghanistan, could not have guessed that by the 20th anniversary of 9/11, America’s ruling elite would have become this fascist. Indeed, when a regime uses the power of the state to compel major corporations to enforce its mandates and enact its agenda, that’s actual textbook fascism. Hitchens, if he were alive to see it, might have called it “fascism with a bureaucrat’s face,” or “bureaufascism.”

Biden’s vaccine mandate is of course just one example, plucked from yesterday’s news cycle, of the left’s hatred of America and the freedom of its people. Over the past year-and-a-half of the pandemic, we have witnessed an unprecedented expansion of rule by executive fiat, with governors and mayors and public health officials wielding powers too often directed against churches and independent businesses. The 9/11 hijackers hated our freedoms, to be sure, but the pandemic has revealed that the left hates those freedoms at least as much as the terrorists, and would like very much to stamp them out.

Like the hijackers, the left holds almost everything about America in contempt. We are told in our workplaces — and our children are taught in their schools — that the United States is irredeemably racist, founded on violence, and that our constitutional experiment amounts to nothing more than a massive crime. We are called upon to repudiate our past and pull down monuments to our forebears — not just Confederate generals but also our Founding Fathers.

We are instructed that men can be women if they so choose, and those who disagree should probably lose their jobs and be ostracized. If you object to your daughter being forced to compete in school sports with boys who claim to be girls, you’re a bigot who must be silenced.

The reductive, totalizing ideology of the left has seeped into nearly every institution of American life, and dominates our culture and our politics. It is profoundly anti-American, and in the final analysis, it is a far greater threat to the future of our republic than even the wildest plots and most murderous fantasies of all the world’s jihadists combined.

When it comes to tearing down America, brick by brick, the Islamofascists of 9/11 had nothing on those who now command the heights of our culture, and purport to rule us from Washington.

"Treason?: In Secret Calls, Milley Agreed To Alert China Of Any US Attacks","Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made secret calls to his Chinese counterpart in the final days of the Trump administration out of hysteria that President Donald Trump might order an attack.

Milley made two phone calls to Gen. Li Zuocheng of the People’s Liberation Army, according to an excerpt published Tuesday from a new book by Washington Post associate editor Bob Woodward and national political reporter Robert Costa titled “Peril.” One call occurred on Oct. 30, 2020 — four days before the November election — and one on Jan. 8 of this year, two days after the Capitol riot by a mob of Trump supporters. In each, Milley assured the Chinese the United States was not preparing to strike.

“General Li, I want to assure you that the American government is stable and everything is going to be okay,” Milley reportedly told Zuocheng in October. “We are not going to attack or conduct any kinetic operations against you.”

According to Woodward and Acosta, Milley even pledged to alert the Chinese in advance of an impending strike.

“General Li, you and I have known each other for now five years. If we’re going to attack, I’m going to call you ahead of time. It’s not going to be a surprise,” Milley allegedly said.

In January, Milley reportedly tried to taper down Chinese concerns about American stability in the aftermath of the riot at the U.S. Capitol.

“We are 100 percent steady. Everything’s fine. But democracy can be sloppy sometimes,” Milley said.

The American general was apparently provoked by U.S. intelligence that the Chinese believed the Trump administration was preparing to attack, based on contentious military exercises in the South China Sea and the Republican president’s aggressive rhetoric towards the east Asian adversary.

Milley also ordered senior military officers to review protocols for nuclear weapons, reminding each while the president could give the order, Milley had to be involved in the process.

The revelations come at a turbulent time for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff following a botched withdrawal from Afghanistan. While the Taliban were in the midst of a successful blitzkrieg across the war-torn nation, Milley was testifying before House lawmakers that U.S. military personnel needed to be focused on understanding “white rage.”

“I want to understand white rage,” Milley told the Armed Services Committee, “And I’m white.”

Milley also sparred with Trump publicly last summer when the general apologized for appearing alongside the then-president at a historic D.C. church the day after one of the worst outbreaks of American political unrest in decades.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/09/14/treason-gen-milley-undermined-trump-white-house-with-secret-calls-promising-to-alert-china-of-potential-u-s-attacks/,2021-09-14
Left Revives Attempt To Build Mosque On Site Of Islamist 9,"One of the strangest aspects of post-9/11 America has been the compulsion of so many to change the narrative about the attacks that took place 20 years ago. We were reminded of that again recently by a new Netflix documentary, “Turning Point: 9/11 and the War on Terror.”

Along with what is by now a familiar litany of criticisms of the George W. Bush administration’s policies and its treatment of captured terrorists as well as its failures in Iraq and Afghanistan, the film also offered a one-sided view of a controversy that had little to do with actual events of 9/11 and everything about efforts to influence the way Americans should think about it and themselves.

In treating opposition to the failed effort to build a Muslim community center and mosque in the shadow of the fallen twin towers of the World Trade Center as representative of what it considers to be a pervasive anti-Muslim prejudice, Netflix has essentially lent its considerable influence to an effort to reshape the 9/11 narrative from one about Islamist terror to one about American racism. This effort was lent further credence by the Anti-Defamation League’s decision to commemorate the assault on America by revisiting the organization’s decision to oppose what came to be known as the “Ground Zero mosque.”

Bush and the rest of the government, as well as the U.S. media and entertainment industry, went to great lengths to point out that the conflict was only with the radicals who had attacked America rather than all Muslims. But almost immediately, a counter-narrative about 9/11 began to be put forward. In this reading, the real story wasn’t about those who committed the atrocities and their goals. Instead, for some, the most important thing about 9/11 was that it gave birth to a surge of Islamophobia.

Though there was little evidence to support it, a myth that there was a post-9/11 backlash against Muslims in America was embraced by much of the mainstream media and others who purported to advocate for civil rights. Among the leaders of this effort was the Council of American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a group that had its origins as a front to raise funds for Hamas terrorists in the United States but masquerades as a civil rights advocacy organization.

Mosque Proposed in Footprint of Twin Towers

It was in this context that in 2010 an effort was made to build a mosque on the site of one of the buildings that had been struck by debris falling from the collapsed World Trade Center buildings. While none except a few extremists disputed the right of any religious group to build a house of worship or community center where it wanted to, the idea of converting that specific site into a large Islamic facility outraged families of the victims and much of the public.

Abe Foxman, then the director of the Anti-Defamation League, took a stand opposing the building of the Ground Zero mosque, labeling it as an insensitive gesture that would do more to inflame religious conflict than, as its promoters disingenuously claimed, to heal the city.

Nevertheless, leftist opinion backed the project, and those who said it was inappropriate, such as former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and scholar Daniel Pipes, were denounced as Islamophobic, a theme that is taken up by the Netflix documentary, which represents the effort to build the facility as an exercise in idealism that was cruelly snuffed out by bigots. Nevertheless, the plan for the Islamic center failed to materialize and, up until now, it was just a divisive footnote to the 9/11 story.

But on the 20th anniversary of the attacks, the mosque is back in the news due to an op-ed by Jonathan Greenblatt, Foxman’s successor at the ADL, in which he apologized for his organization’s opposition to the mosque. The former Clinton and Obama administration operative — who has transformed the ADL from a liberal-leaning opponent of anti-Semitism into a partisan front group for Democrats — not only recycled the anti-Muslim backlash myth but also the disingenuous claim that the Trump administration’s ban on immigration from five Muslim-majority nations that were terrorist hotbeds administration was a “Muslim ban.”

Although Greenblatt claims FBI statistics back up his claims about an anti-Muslim backlash, a look at the last 20 years of such data proves the opposite. The number of attacks on Muslims has remained small even when temporary hikes occurred. Throughout this period, the numbers show that the overwhelming majority of religion-based attacks have been aimed at Jews, not at Muslims.

An Attempt at Distraction from Disaster in Afghanistan

Greenblatt and others on the left are again trying to change the subject from our disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. The Taliban — the Islamist group that hosted the al-Qaida terrorists — initially planned to inaugurate their new government on Sept. 11. But they were ultimately persuaded to back down by their allies in Pakistan, who rightly understood this was an unnecessary provocation that would interfere with efforts to persuade the United States to reconcile itself to a stunning defeat. While four administrations from both political parties contributed to this catastrophe, the feckless Biden administration’s move will help recruiting for various Islamist radical terror groups and encourage rogue regimes such as Iran.

In retrospect, the Ground Zero mosque controversy was about trying to mire Americans in a self-destructive and dishonest conversation about prejudice rather than one about the real dilemmas of the struggle against Islamist extremism. The fact that the organizers of the plan now claim that criticism of leftist Squad members Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., for their anti-Semitism is morally equivalent to opposition to the mosque illuminates their mindset and goals.

While Netflix’s revisionism is hardly surprising, who would have believed 10 years ago that the ADL, the group tasked with defending Jews against the ideas and the people behind 9/11, would be lending its influence to this disgraceful effort? Greenblatt’s stand — and the applause it received from establishment opinion — speaks volumes about that group’s descent into partisanship and toxic leftist ideology. But it also demonstrates the way the chattering classes have embraced the desire to change the story about 9/11 from one of terrorism and heroism into another leftist lie about American racism.

Press Makes No Outcry Over Antifa Routinely Assaulting Journalists,"From covering displaced refugees around the globe to the obstacles faced by protesters seeking change in America, freelance photojournalist Maranie Staab believes her camera can be a force for truth and social justice. The work of a “conflict photographer” often requires physical courage in places she has reported from, such as Africa and the Middle East. It certainly did so on Aug. 22, while Staab was covering demonstrations in Portland, Ore.

Members of the left-wing group antifa called her a “slut” and then demanded that journalists assembled to cover the protests “get the f— out.” Staab, a 2020 reporting fellow for the liberal Pulitzer Center, tried to calm the situation. She was assaulted. She told the Willamette Week that they grabbed her phone and smashed it.

Then they threw her to the pavement and sprayed her with mace. The ugly assault on Staab (below) was filmed and distributed quickly online, resulting in widespread condemnation. “If we’re on a public street and a newsworthy event is occurring, you’re not going to tell me what I can and cannot film,” Staab told the weekly newspaper.

Antifascists threatened to “smash cameras” of journalists, and targeted @MaranieRae personally. She approached to speak to their group, and they shot paint and mace at her and threw her on the ground. As she recovered, one shot more paint at both her and press helping her.

For the small band of reporters willing cover the violent left-wing radicals in antifa, such attacks are distressingly common. Protest mayhem has been in the news since the murder of George Floyd last summer brought many Black Lives Matter and antifa activists out on the streets. But the anti-media animus of antifa – which, unlike BLM, focuses on deliberately attacking reporters – has been an issue for years.

“We are deeply concerned by the increase in attacks on journalists working in the United States,” the Committee to Protect Journalists tells RealClearInvestigations. “Since 2017, the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker has documented 517 journalists attacked during protests, 400 of those in 2020 alone. Attacking reporters who are covering matters of public interest is never okay.”

Despite the alarming increase in such attacks, reporters who cover antifa express frustration that the condemnation of the attack on Staab was an aberration. More often than not, antifa’s attacks on the press have gone ignored, with the police typically standing back in the current climate of hostility toward law enforcement.

The journalists who have done significant reporting on the loose-knit group are of divergent backgrounds and motivations, but tend to have one thing in common – they represent a new breed of journalist without the backing of traditional corporate media outlets. Instead, they rely on social media to break news. Some of their work has been criticized by other journalists who claim they blur the line between professional reporting and activism.

No reporter is better known for covering antifa than Andy Ngo, author of the best-selling book “Unmasked: Inside Antifa’s Radical Plan to Destroy Democracy.” Ngo, the son of Vietnamese immigrants, first started reporting on protest violence for the Portland State Vanguard, Portland State University’s student newspaper, in 2016. He was fired from his job at the paper the next year after he was accused of sensationalizing a clip of a Muslim student at a university event saying that “being an infidel is not allowed” in Muslim countries. This ended Ngo’s traditional journalism career, but the story blew up online and was picked up by conservative media nationally.

With left-wing violence largely ignored by legacy news organizations, Ngo quickly found there was a market for coverage of Portland’s growing problem with street violence — notably by antifa, a largely decentralized, avowedly anti-fascist and anti-racist political movement without an identifiable leader or spokesperson that is concentrated in the Pacific Northwest.

Soon Ngo was in the streets working as a freelance reporter while his Twitter feed became a nationally known clearinghouse for information related to antifa – everything from videos of violence and vandalism to the ensuing mugshots and charging documents. Ngo currently works as editor-at-large for a right-leaning web outlet, The Post Millennial. However, his journalism is still largely defined by his outsized social media presence, to say nothing of his reputation for angering antifa.

In June of 2019, Ngo was jumped by a crowd of antifa protesters while reporting on a demonstration in the city. They kicked him in the groin, repeatedly punched him in the head while wearing tactical gloves with fiberglass-reinforced knuckles, and then pelted him with hard objects. Ngo ended up in the hospital with a brain hemorrhage.

Ngo says he has been attacked four times and no longer lives in Portland out of concern for his safety, but antifa regularly show up and make menacing appearances at his aging mother’s house in the city. Graffiti has appeared in Portland saying, “Kill Andy Ngo” and “Andy Ngo 187” – 187 being a police code to denote a murder. “It’s just been this constant incitement to kill me,” he says. “That’s why I left at the end of last year,” Ngo said. When he returned to Portland this past May, he said, he was chased down a street and beaten and bloodied. He narrowly escaped when he took refuge in a hotel, with the antifa mob surrounding the lobby doors and demanding that he come outside.

RCI could find only one other statement from the society’s Oregon’s chapter condemning an attack by left-wing protesters, one earlier this year involving Justin Yau, a journalist working for Willamette Week. The organization did not respond to RCI’s request for other examples of its condemnation of attacks on other reporters or for comment on this article. SPJ’s national president, Rebecca Aguilar, said in an email Wednesday that she would need more time to issue a “proper response,” acknowledging “a very dangerous situation for journalists seeking the truth.” (Reporters Without Borders, the international organization, also did not respond to a request for comment on antifa attacks on reporters.)

Ngo isn’t alone in thinking that these attacks on the press are being downplayed. So does Nancy Rommelmann, who as a journalist has written for the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, and has been an author for decades. Her well-received 2018 book, “To the Bridge: A True Story of Motherhood and Murder,” detailed an infamous case of infanticide in Portland. As a longtime area resident who watched her husband’s small business suffer from antifa’s violence, she felt compelled to get to the bottom of what was happening. Working as a freelancer, she filed several reports on antifa and street violence in Portland for the libertarian magazine Reason.

She was attacked in the streets, she says, and threatened online, with her photo publicly posted. Rommelmann believes the traditional media are ignoring the street violence for political reasons – they don’t want antifa’s extremism to be seen as discrediting to liberal causes. “I can tell you that 100% of the people that have attacked and continue to attack me, they’re all on the left – all of them. And I consider myself a liberal,” Rommelmann said.

To the extent that traditional news media are forced to cover antifa, Rommelmann says, they do so only when its adherents clash with right-wing protesters, and draw equivalencies with right-wing violence regardless of whether comparisons are warranted.

After the assault on Staab last month, Rommelmann began venting on Twitter about why the media refused to acknowledge that “black bloc protesters [those wearing black ski masks and other garments to obscure their identities] in Portland are the MAIN source of violence. Proud Boys and right-wing groups rolled through [just] four times in 2020. Then who tf was committing the violence every night?”

She then linked to video footage she took of a man in downtown Portland trying to smash a window with a fire extinguisher. “I was reminded, again, of a Portland editor telling someone my reporting ‘infers without actual evidence,’” she tweeted. “Like, what, my eyeballs were rolled in flour? I didn’t have my phone stolen? We are supposed to believe the guy who says I staged this video in a studio?”

.@mtaibbi links video to what happened in Portland this weekend. THIS HAPPENED ALL THE TIME WHEN I WAS ON THE GROUND! Taibbi is right to write, ""It’s time the wider press took more notice, because this is not an aberration with this type of activist"" but what took so f*king long? — Nancy Rommelmann (@NancyRomm) August 25, 2021

There’s no question that attacks on journalists are common from angry Americans on the right. The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker notes a number of recent violent episodes at school board meetings and anti-COVID restriction protests. But a number of the right-wing groups that clash with antifa don’t necessarily have hostile relationships with the media. Joey Gibson, the founder of Patriot Prayer, a right-wing group active in Portland known for clashing with antifa, has shown a willingness to be profiled and talk to reporters. The difference with antifa is that it espouses an explicit ideology that compels its adherents to attack the press.

In “The Antifa Handbook,” radical Rutgers University lecturer Mark Bray observes that First Amendment beliefs are held only by “a minority of today’s anti-fascists in the United States.” Bray writes that they distrust the press because, “instead of privileging allegedly ‘neutral’ universal rights, anti-fascists prioritize the political project of destroying fascism and protecting the vulnerable regardless of whether their actions are considered violations of the free speech of fascists or not.”

Rommelmann reports that “‘YOU’RE NOT ALLOWED TO FILM’ and its occasional variation, ‘PHOTOGRAPHY EQUALS DEATH!’” are rallying cries at protests where antifa is present. And at the same time some antifa protesters assault independent journalists and smash their cameras, she says, radical activists run around protests with PRESS emblazoned on their clothing as a putative “Independent Press Corps” in league with antifa. The goal is to shut down impartial reporters covering events so that the only photos and video footage released on social media are hand-selected by antifa to make police look bad and for other propaganda purposes. “It’s a revolution via the cellphone video they allow you to see,” Rommelmann said.

Rommelmann says this strategy of limiting what people see appeared to work when antifa and allied leftist groups laid siege to the Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse in downtown Portland for a month last summer.

“They would then disseminate [their own recordings] to news organizations around the country and around the world and on their own Instagrams. And they would form a narrative and the narrative was, all from the Antifa black bloc saying, the protesters are beleaguered. Were the feds inside shooting things out at the protesters? Hell, yeah. Mostly hours after the protesters had been shooting stuff at them, but that was not the story that was getting disseminated,” Rommelmann says. “The story that was getting disseminated was, ‘People on the right bad, people on the left good.’ Well, when I would try to bring some balance to this, I had my phone stolen. I was called a fascist and that continues to this day, because of the narrative that’s seeped out in the mainstream media.”

Making matters worse, the media readily adopted the simplistic and inaccurate framing of protest violence because it fed into national political narratives. “There seemed to be this sense, amid the massive pro-Trump/anti-Trump environment of last year’s protests, that if you said one eenie-weenie bad thing about the violence, it meant you were, at best, anti-protest movement, and at worst a racist,” Rommelmann says. “This caused the cognitive dissonance we saw on both ‘sides’: Fox News shouting, ‘SAVAGES COMING TO YOUR TOWN!!!’ and the CNN anchor in Kenosha standing in front of an absolute conflagration and saying, ‘It’s really mostly peaceful.’”

More broadly, many news outlets downplayed the left-wing violence associated with the broader protest movement that swept the country in the wake of the murder of a black man, George Floyd, at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer. According to data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project – an independent organization that receives funding from the State Department, German Foreign Office, and University of Texas – during the peak months of the protests last summer, there were 11,541 “civil-society incidents.” Of those events, 1,101 devolved into some form of violence or rioting, and 933 of the violent incidents directly involved events affiliated with Black Lives Matter.

The organization’s data is pulled from media reports, so this figure is likely understating the problem. Nevertheless, many news outlets reported on the findings as if they absolved BLM and the left of violence. “About 93% of racial justice protests in the U.S. since the death of George Floyd have been peaceful and nondestructive, according to a new report,” reported CNN. “The findings, released Thursday, contradict assumptions and claims by some that protests associated with the Black Lives Matter movement are spawning violence and destruction of property.”

Counterinsurgency expert David Kilcullen, a senior adviser to Gen. David Petraeus and one of the architects of the “surge” in Iraq, said those stats were more in line with the levels of violence seen in war zones, writing that:

[T]he argument that the protests have been ‘largely peaceful’ may be true, but it is also irrelevant. Only a tiny minority – 2 to 5 percent – of individuals in insurgencies, civil wars, or criminal gangs actually commit violence. In Iraq during the ‘Surge,’ my team started from the assumption that 20 percent of insurgents would prove so irreconcilably violent that they would never negotiate and must therefore be killed or captured. We were off by an order of magnitude – the true number was not 20, but 2 percent.

Even as outlets including the Guardian and the Washington Post published articles dismissing left-wing violence — including a Post fact-check piece last summer declaring, “Who caused the violence at protests? It wasn’t antifa” — others attacked the journalists trying to cover the protests.

In May, the left-wing publication The Intercept published a lengthy feature headlined “ Meet the Riot Squad: Right-Wing Reporters Whose Viral Videos Are Used to Smear BLM ,” which identified a “tight-knit group of eight young journalists” who travel around the country and report on street violence. The article highlighted instances where reporters critical of left-wing protesters shared video of street violence that appeared to be either selectively edited or missing important context. This is bad journalism for sure, but it’s also a problem endemic to social media. All journalists covering breaking news – not just those dedicated to covering antifa – have been incentivized to rush to get viral clips online or share clips they’ve been given without knowing the context, and examples of it are widespread.

The article was quickly denounced by a founder of The Intercept, Glenn Greenwald, who resigned from the website during the 2020 presidential campaign citing censorship of his work and “ideological homogeneity.” “This is what so much ‘journalism’ is now,” Greenwald tweeted. “They believe that the real menaces are individuals who have politics or ideology different than their liberal orthodoxies. So these reporters are now like criminals to them because they report for right-wing sites, thus this targeting.”

Robert Mackey, one of the Intercept article’s co-authors, tweeted in response: “These journalists are public figures, already familiar faces on the most-watched prime time shows on the most-watched television news network in America; what is overlooked is how their reporting and video is used by Fox to distort the real scope of violence at BLM protests. … There have been assaults on some conservative video journalists by left-wing protesters who view them as propagandists, attacks I reported and showed in the video and denounced forcefully in my article. The claim that I intended to promote more attacks is false and repulsive.”

Facing similar criticism from the left, Andy Ngo has been dogged by accusations that he should not be treated as a legitimate journalist because critics accuse him of having reported misleading information and not reporting on antifa objectively. An article in the Columbia Journalism Review referred to him as a “discredited provocateur.”

Ngo does much of his reporting on Twitter and social media, in part due to a lack of interest in antifa from the broader media. Leftists on Twitter complained that the social media platform labeled him a journalist on the site’s curated newsfeed, so in response Twitter relabeled him an “author.” Twitter also took away Ngo’s coveted “blue check” that signifies his is an account verified by the platform.

Twitter’s move prompted an editorial in the New York Post defending Ngo’s reporting. “How is he not a journalist? Indeed, that he’s doing the work that establishment outlets skip out on makes him more of a journo than the members of the press who turn a blind eye to Antifa’s violence,” the paper wrote.

Ngo’s reporting has always made it clear that he’s critical of antifa. Moreover, if making the occasional error or having a point of view is disqualifying for a journalist, the New York Times and Washington Post — and the vast majority of reporters and editors in the country — would have their press credentials revoked.

The criticism of Ngo is particularly galling when one considers that his main point of view is that “political violence is wrong.” And while Ngo’s nontraditional, social-media-heavy approach to reporting might be disdained by traditional media outlets, he has distinguished himself by authoring a best-selling book on antifa and having a track record of breaking several major stories.

Ngo, however, remains undeterred. In June, when a reporter from the left-leaning sports site Deadspin was among those demanding Twitter stop calling Ngo a journalist, he responded. “My detractors do this because they want to take away the one thing that all decent people agree on: press freedom is sacred,” Ngo wrote. “Who the far-left defines as ‘press’ are those who write what they approve of. Anyone else is a ‘provocateur’ deserving of intimidation and violence.”

Can You Spot The Difference Between These Two Insurrection Photos?,"Images of the insurrection are hard to stomach. Who did these lawless rogues think they were to launch an attack on the federal government? Taser barbs flew as demonstrators tried to batter their way past police lines, with law enforcers suffering injuries to the point of requiring hospitalization. Chants and obscenities rose from the mob of radicals trying to send a message in the form of infiltrating our esteemed government quarters with physical force. Some activists vandalized a building, while others pinned police against a wall. This rebellion against authority was nothing short of sedition.

Oh, you thought I was talking about this image, where pro-Trump demonstrator Ashli Babbitt attempted to force her way into where police were holding the line?

I was actually talking about this scene, where a radical activist appears to try the same thing at a different federal building, even shouting “Let’s go!” for other demonstrators to follow her.

Can you spot the difference?

Oct. 14 ‘Insurrection’

I’m talking about the rowdy protest outside the Department of the Interior on Thursday that turned violent as climate activists stormed the entrance — the Oct. 14 insurrection.

These climate activists staged a sit-in within the Interior Department, with demonstrators who were left outside struggling with law enforcement officers as they reportedly tried to force their way in, shouting “Go inside! Go inside!” The ordeal resulted in a number of injuries, according to multiple sources.

“Multiple injuries were sustained by security personnel, and one officer has been transported to a nearby hospital. Medics representing both the Department and the protesters were present,” Interior Department spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said in a statement. “It is also our obligation to keep everyone safe. We will continue to do everything we can to de-escalate the situation while honoring first amendment rights.”

Jennifer K. Falcon, who according to her Twitter bio does communications for the Indigenous Environmental Network, tweeted updates of what occurred inside the building, which was infiltrated by a large group of activists (whom Falcon referred to as “water protectors”), more than 50 of whom were arrested and removed.

“Update: first round of arrestees are out. Still two rounds left. #occupybia #expectus,” activist Falcon tweeted after noting that 55 activists had already been removed from the building.

Meanwhile, a mob of angry activists outside battled police and continued their attack on the federal building.

Think Back

Amid this unrest, it’s hard not to think about another attack on a government building this year, this one back in January, where a group of mostly right-wing rioters forced their way into the U.S. Capitol over election integrity. During that riot — which the left including corporate media described an “insurrection” and Joe Biden said “borders on sedition,” which is why I’ve applied that standard here — Democrat leaders and pundits immediately flooded Twitter and the airwaves with condemnation of violent activism. An attack on the federal government is a threat to democracy, they cried during the attack and then every day since — until this week.

A quick look at Twitter trends on Friday afternoon shows “Capitol Police” trending near the bottom of the list — but only because of something related to Jan. 6. Not a peep about the climate extremists busting their way into a major government building.

The Washington Post’s little write-up characterized it as “clashes,” with the paper’s anodyne tweet saying “activists ‘occupy’ Interior Department” with some of them “entering the building and holding a sit-in,” the same blasé word The Hill used. Something tells me CNN and MSNBC won’t be giving this forceful entry quite the same wall-to-wall coverage as the Jan 6. riot, if they cover it at all.

That’s because when Democrats and the media pontificate about political violence and “attacks on our democracy,” they aren’t talking about all political violence or all attacks on our government. They’re only talking about the ones they can use to smear Republicans and boost their narrative.

Remember when then-President Donald Trump was excoriated in the media for not condemning the Capitol riot quickly enough? (And then remember how Big Tech nuked him from their sites after he called on demonstrators to be peaceful and go home? — a message those demonstrators never got because the sitting president was muzzled by tech oligarchs.) Well, where are President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris now that these left-wing activists are attacking the federal government? And why isn’t anyone in the corporate media calling on them to denounce this violence clearly and swiftly?

We know why, which brings us back to the two pictures. There is no difference between them. The photos both depict young women, revved up about perceived political injustice, taking things a step too far in going after those they decided to hold responsible.

The only disparity is how they’ll be treated. One was shot, while the other walked away. One was blasted by the press, and one won’t ever make the news. The first led to the media complex berating an entire side of the political aisle for a violent insurrection and to Big Tech censoring swaths of dissidents for deadly misinformation, while the second will just be one of the nameless activists who hosted a sit-in barely worth mentioning.

Despite the media’s disparate treatment, the facts show that the most recent “insurrection” mirrors the January one. Which Democrat is going to call for an Oct. 14 Commission?

"Hawley: Leftists Want Men To Stand Down, But We're Standing Up Instead","This is the text of Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley’s speech on Oct. 31 at the National Conservatism conference, which is running in Florida this year from Oct. 31 to Nov. 2.

Good evening. It is a pleasure to be with you tonight.

I had the honor to be at your inaugural conference two years ago. After that speech, the Left called me a racist, a fascist, and a Nazi.

So when Yoram invited me to speak again this year, I thought: What’s to lose?

I spoke two years ago of the Left’s ambition to create a world beyond belonging—a world where community and shared culture—our culture—count for little. It’s part of the Left’s effort to fundamentally remake America.

I want to talk with you tonight about another aspect of that ambition. I want to talk with you about the Left’s attempt to give us a world beyond men.

We meet at a time of reckoning. As we speak, the Left controls the commanding heights of American society. They have the White House, the House of Representatives, the Senate. Their voices predominate in the news media, in Hollywood, arguably sports, and of course, at our universities.

This is their hour. And they are determined to use it.

The Left know what they believe. They believe that America is a systemically racist, structurally oppressive, hopelessly patriarchal kind of place. It’s a dystopia, if only Americans would get woke enough to see it. It’s a nation that needs to be taught how unjust it truly is and after that, rebuilt from top to bottom.

That’s the Leftist project, and that’s their grand ambition: to deconstruct America.

This work of deconstruction is what unites today’s Left and binds together all their various preoccupations, from critical race theory to their economic socialism to their bizarre war on women’s sports.

But what I want you to notice, what I want to call out tonight, is this fact: that the deconstruction of America begins with and depends on the deconstruction of American men.

The Left want to define traditional masculinity as toxic. They want to define the traditional masculine virtues—things like courage, and independence, and assertiveness—as a danger to society.

This is an effort the Left has been at for years now. And they have had // alarming success. American men are working less, getting married in fewer numbers; they’re fathering fewer children. They are suffering more anxiety and depression. They are engaging in more substance abuse.

Many men in this country are in crisis, and their ranks are swelling.

And that’s not just a crisis for men. It’s a crisis for the republic.

Because the problem with the Left’s assault on the masculine virtues is that those self-same qualities, the very ones the Left now vilify as dangerous and toxic, have long been regarded as vital to self-government.

Observers from the ancient Romans to our forefathers identified the manly virtues as indispensable for political liberty.

Now maybe they were wrong and today’s Left is right. Maybe virtue isn’t needed for liberty. Or maybe the only necessary virtues are the modern liberal ones of tolerance, and compliance, and I suppose, consumption. Maybe all you need to be a good citizen after all is to be a good consumer.

But it doesn’t look that way. It’s hard to argue that our democracy is in better shape now than it was thirty or forty years ago. It’s hard to believe that our liberty is now more secure.

It’s hard to accept that the pathologies gripping so many American men are good for American society. I’d contend just the opposite.

Now this is not to say that American women aren’t central to this story, far from it. American women have shaped our culture every bit as much as men, and their virtues are every bit as necessary to the success of our republic.

And indeed, the Left is carrying out its own assault on womanhood, and on the very idea of gender.

Many of my Democrat colleagues in the Senate won’t even say the word “mother” any more, for heaven’s sake. “Birthing people” is the term of choice, as if women don’t exist.

And leftwing advocates across the country are trying to destroy women’s sports, as if women and men are somehow interchangeable.

All that too is part of the deconstructionist agenda.

But I want to focus tonight on the deconstruction of men, not because men are more important, but because I believe the attack on men has been the tip of the spear of the Left’s broader attack on America. And because this attack on men is already far advanced.

But even as I describe the danger, there is cause for hope. For while the Left’s assault on manhood has been sharp and prolonged, it has not yet succeeded. And we must make it our aim as conservatives to see that it does not succeed.

More than that, we must seek a revival of strong and healthy manhood in America. We need men who will shoulder responsibility, men who will start and provide for families, men who will enter the covenant of marriage and then honor it.

We need men to raise up sons and daughters after them, to pass on the great truths of our culture and history, to defend liberty, to share in the work of self-government.

We need the kind of men who make republics possible.

And it is not too much to say that our ability to get that kind of men will determine the success of our long experiment in liberty.

***

Let me start by pressing home this point. The Left’s attack on America leads directly to an attack on manhood.

For years now, Democrats and other leftists have insisted that American society is systemically oppressive, systemically evil and unjust. They’ve said it so much and so often that to them, it’s become a truism. It’s become the very cornerstone of their worldview.

Just listen to the President of the United States. Joe Biden has, as president, repeatedly referred to America’s “systemic racism.” His Administration has loudly called for a new “gender equity” agenda to right the structural injustices of our society.

His nominees have advocated critical race theory and training in “equity” for federal workers.

This past week the Administration celebrated the introduction of an “X” gender marker on American passports. X means neither male nor female, if you’re keeping up.

All this points to how important the deconstructionist agenda is to Team Biden and to the Left. Inflation is rampant, store shelves are bare, but the Administration won’t be distracted from what truly matters, exposing just how bad America is.

Other prominent liberals have taken the next step and identified America’s many alleged woes with men in particular.

Take Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez. “White supremacy and patriarchy are linked in a lot of ways,” she says. Meaning that America’s systemic racism is a systemic problem with men.

Author John Stoltenberg writes that “talking about ‘healthy masculinity’ is like talking about `healthy cancer.’”

Professor Suzanna Walters of Northeastern University says it “seems logical to hate men” unless they “pledge to vote for feminist women only” and “don’t run for office.”

Now this line of thinking is hardly new. The critical theory of deconstruction runs back to mid-century intellectuals like Jacques Derrida and Herbert Marcuse; and farther back to the Frankfurt School of the 1930s; and back farther still to Marx.

Nor is it new to blame men for society’s ills. Marcuse in particular is interesting in this regard. He was one of the leading lights of the 1960s counter-culture, and he thought Marx was right to call western society structurally oppressive, but wrong to see that oppression as principally economic.

No, the really oppressive thing about American society, he said, was culture.

And while Marx pinned his hopes on working class men, the proletariat, Marcuse saw those same men as the problem. They were too culturally conservative. Too hidebound. Too traditional.

Marcuse concluded the revolution would only come from the well-educated elite, who could see beyond mirages like manhood.

Which brings us back to today’s American Left. They’ve swallowed this theory whole and they are delivering this message from every platform where they have power. Which is most everywhere.

University curricula abound with seminars on masculinity and its defects. To take but one sample of what’s on offer, consider Professor David Cohen of Drexel Kline School of Law: “Traditional masculinity,” he says, “has oppressed girls and women and limited the identity construction of all boys and men.”

A seminar at Williams College, called “Performing Masculinity in Global Popular Culture,” asks “Why must masculinity be the purview of males at all?” Answering that question will cost you $75,000 a year.

Even our military academies are in on the act. West Point reportedly held mandatory events last year addressing “gender norms,” including “toxic masculinity.” One cadet said afterwards, “I’m being taught how not to be a man.”

Men are getting the message. They’re leaving higher education in record numbers. I suspect you’ve seen the recent Wall Street Journal reporting: Women now make up 60 percent of college students; men, 40 percent. Experts predict a 2:1 ratio soon, with the trend sped up by the pandemic.

But the message of toxic masculinity is not only in the academy. It’s in our grade schools, where boys are increasingly treated like an illness in search of a cure. If boys are too rambunctious, they’re diagnosed with hyperactivity disorder and medicated into submission.

Hollywood delivers the toxic masculinity theme ad nauseum in television and film.

And our expert class amplifies it. The American Psychological Association now advises that “conforming to traditional masculinity ideology has been shown to limit males’ psychological development … and negatively influence mental health and physical health.” Manhood is a disease to be defeated.

The Left delivers the same message in the press, through the corporations, and through advertising. Gillette infamously ran an ad campaign for its razors in 2019 that included this voice-over: “Bullying … MeToo movement against sexual harassment … toxic masculinity … is this the best a man can get?”

And the Left is writing this same men-are-the-problem mantra into policy.

Working class men have been a particular target for this Administration. President Biden’s illegal vaccine mandate on private citizens puts millions of working class men squarely in the cross hairs. Shut up, get the jab, or get lost.

Nevermind these are the very people hailed as “essential workers” not twelve months ago. Not anymore. Now they’re expendable. Now they’re the problem.

But the Left has been pursuing its attack on men through policy for longer than the last year, and sometimes with the help of Republicans.

Over the last thirty years and more, government policy has helped destroy the kind of economy that gave meaning to generations of men.

Domestic manufacturing once supported millions of American men with good wages, who in turn started and supported families. Now that industry lies all but dead on the altar of globalism.

At the same time, advancing consolidation has made it almost impossible for family farmers to compete against multinational firms.

The result is fewer and fewer men working. And I don’t mean the elderly or disabled, I mean prime-aged, able-bodied men.

Since 1965, the number of adult men between the ages of twenty and sixty-four not working—not even looking for work, but completely and totally out of the labor force—has quintupled, soaring from 3 million in the 1960s to more than 16 million in 2015.

And the less men work, the less they marry.

Marriage rates are plummeting. And the age of first marriage continues to rise, as men push commitment off further and further into the future.

By 2010, a majority of men in this country between 25 and 34 had never married. And that trend has accelerated since.

Fewer marriages means fewer fathers in the home. By 2020, over 18 million American children lived without a father present. That’s more than a quarter of all children in America. And I probably don’t need to remind you that an absent father is strongly correlated with increased childhood poverty, childhood depression, and poor academic performance. …

I am not here tonight to tell you that men are victims. The last thing we need more of in this country is the victim mindset. And men who blame others for their problems and then slink away to do nothing, or worse, who embrace violence or cruelty, deserve rebuke.

Responsibility is one of God’s greatest gifts to mankind, and men must be held responsible for their actions.

Still … can we be surprised that after years of being told they are the problem, that their manhood is the problem, more and more men are withdrawing into the enclave of idleness, and pornography, and video games.

I found the comment by one young man to the Wall Street Journal particularly evocative, and particularly heartbreaking. He said, “I’m sort of waiting for a light to come on so I can figure out what to do next.” I suspect he speaks for many.

And while the Left may celebrate this decline of men, I for one cannot join them. No one should.

The crisis of American men is a crisis for the American republic.

It’s not just that millions of men out of work slows our innovation and economic growth.

It’s not just the billions of dollars in welfare payments these idle men cost the federal fisc year on year.

It’s not only the depression and darkness that now shadow so many.

It’s that liberty requires virtue. And in particular, it requires the manly virtues.

America needs good men. …

The liberty of a republic is a demanding thing.

To keep a republic, you have to be willing to fight for it.

To share in self-government, you have to stand strong against those who would try to make you dependent on their wealth or influence.

To preserve liberty, you have to discipline your passions and sacrifice in the service of others.

For centuries, lovers of liberty have praised these qualities as the highest standard of manhood. That’s not to say that women don’t possess them. But it is to say that these virtues are the bright side of the aggression and competitiveness and independence that psychologists, no less than philosophers, have long observed in men.

Assertiveness and independence are strengths when used to protect and empower others.

Want an example? Look no further than those dads at Southwood High School in Shreveport, Louisiana. The ones who just by showing up, calmed the fighting and changed the atmosphere of an entire campus. As one student said to a reporter, “Dads have the power to do that.”

Every republic needs those kind of men.

The question is, how are we going to raise up good men today?

We can start by repudiating the lie that America is a systemically oppressive nation and that men are systemically responsible.

It is a fantasy, it is a folly, it is a falsehood and we should call it out for what it is.

America may be an imperfect place, but it is the most noble experiment in liberty the world has ever seen, for the poor and the rich alike, for men and for women, for black and for white.

And though we have struggled to live up to our ideals—and failed, and risen to struggle again—there is honor in the struggle, and we are still, even now, the last best, hope on earth.

And we must tell the men of this nation that their struggle, too, is noble and that they are needed.

To each man, I say: You can be a tremendous force for good. Your nation needs you. The world needs you.

Your strength can liberate others. Your power can serve those in need. Your creativity can light new paths. Your courage can defend the weak. Your faithfulness can raise up sons and daughters after you and make their way straight. You can make this a more perfect nation.

We must say this to men of our society from the time they are small, and teach it to them in our classrooms and in our homes and in our churches.

And we must do more.

We must rebuild an economy in this country in which men can thrive. And that means rebuilding those manufacturing and production sectors that so much of the chattering class has written off as relics of the past.

In this country, we are more than mere consumers. We have been the makers of great and mighty things, and we shall be again.

The DC experts will say it’s impossible; better to outsource our production to China or Mexico or other places where labor is cheap. But free labor and slave labor should never be put on an even plane. And it is free labor worthy of free men that we are after.

Theodore Roosevelt once said, “I am for business, but I am for manhood first, and business as an adjunct to manhood.” He was right then, and that sentiment should be our watchword today.

We must make every effort to restore a vibrant manufacturing sector in this country that can employ working men at living wages—wages that can feed a family, and support a community. And we can start by requiring that at least half of all goods and supplies critical for our national security be made in the United States.

Speaking of communities, those begin with the family, and we must make the family the center of political life.

We should be clear in the message we send about family and unapologetic: There is no higher calling, and no greater duty, than raising a family. And we should encourage all men to pursue it.

To that end, I believe the time has come for explicit rewards in our tax code for marriage. Forget the marriage penalty. There should be a marriage bonus. And we should allow the parents of young children to keep more of their own money as well. …

The Left is telling America and its men, you’re evil. You’re terrible. You must apologize and submit to your government masters to be reformed.

I suggest we offer a different theme, one that goes like this. … America is yet that city on a hill, and the eyes of the world are yet upon us, looking to us for hope.

American men are and can be an unrivaled force for good in the world—if we can strengthen them, if we can empower them, if we can unleash them to be who they are made to be.

Then they shall, in the words of Scripture, “build up the ancient ruins; they shall raise up the former desolations; they shall repair the ruined cities, [and] the devastations of many generations.”

God bless you. Good night.

Did Corporate Media Already Forget The Waukesha Murders?,"Seven children were still being treated at Children’s Wisconsin Milwaukee Hospital as of Monday morning after Darrell Brooks Jr. allegedly drove an SUV through a Christmas parade in Waukesha. Six people, including a child and three members of the “Dancing Grannies” group that was performing in the parade, were murdered in the attack.

But you might not know that if you just read the corporate media talking points, which make the crime sound more like an “accident,” caused not by a hateful person but by an SUV. After playing down the massacre, the corporate press has now largely decided to keep mum on the case completely.

As of this writing, the last time The New York Times mentioned Darrell Brooks’s name in its pages was on Nov. 25, four days ago. The Washington Post’s last mention was on Nov. 23. This silence comes despite Brooks having a newsworthy history of calling for violence against white people, along with antisemitic and pro-Hitler comments.

Latest stories from NYTimes and WaPo on the Waukesha massacre are at least four days old. pic.twitter.com/lqTCavQj4u — Jeryl Bier (@JerylBier) November 29, 2021

If a murder suspect whom the corporate media had any hopes of portraying as a white supremacist had made pro-Hitler comments, of course, we all know Joy Reid would be talking about it through the New Year. The Waukesha massacre looks strikingly like an act of domestic terrorism, but you won’t see that framing in the press, despite the left’s eagerness to paint concerned public school parents as perpetrators of domestic terror.

Likewise, if there were a way to spin this to fit the leftist narrative that Americans who exercise their Second Amendment rights — like those who bore arms to defend their property and community against violence in Kenosha — are racist domestic terrorists, the media would be all over it. But the murderer didn’t use a gun to kill people, he used an SUV (which by the logic of gun control activists, we should all expect to ban soon).

The Waukesha murders don’t do anything to further the left-wing narrative, so the media have decided to either downplay the crime or forget it altogether. On the morning after the attack, The New York Times thought it appropriate to shoehorn the news into its 22nd page.

And CNN’s coverage was especially egregious, blaming the deaths on a “car” that “drove through a city Christmas parade, killing six people and injuring scores of others.”

Did liberal media send out a memo ordering the Waukesha murderer be described as “a car?” Was there an intervention? A round table?

Last week, The Washington Free Beacon reported that CNN “was not featuring a single story about the Waukesha tragedy on its homepage as of Wednesday afternoon.” And as of this writing, CNN has not so much as tweeted Darrell Brooks’s name. Neither has The New York Times nor The Washington Post.

MSNBC analyst Clint Watts referred to the attack as an “accident,” while the network’s Rachel Maddow neglected to mention Brooks’s name in a segment on the attack the day after it happened.

The Jussie Smollett Lesson: Don’t Try Scamming A Nigerian,"Closing arguments in the Jussie Smollett trial are expected to begin Wednesday, but if there’s one thing we’ve learned already, it’s this: Don’t try to scam a Nigerian.

The contrasting testimonies of the Osundairo brothers and Smollett himself were a perfect illustration of that new truism. Smollett is charged with allegedly filing a false claim in 2019 that he was assaulted by two men who appeared to be Donald Trump supporters and who yelled racist and homophobic slurs during the attack. Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, two brothers from Nigeria and former associates of Smollett, say he paid them to fake the incident.

On the stand, Smollett, a TV actor, was defensive and irritable at simple questions of facts, like why he was aimlessly driving around with the Osundairos before the supposed assault (the Osundairos say that was when he was asking them to stage the event), whether he had text messaged one of the brothers, and why he told police that one of his assailants was “white” and “pale” when in reality the Osundairos couldn’t turn darker if they ran out of breath.

When Special Prosecutor Daniel Webb on Tuesday read aloud text messages Smollett wrote to one of the brothers, Jussie summoned his inner drama queen to ask that Webb not repeat back to him his own use of the n-word, “out of respect for every African American in the courtroom.”

Part of Smollett’s defense is that he was a close friend of Abimbola Osundairo and that Abimbola, a.k.a. “Abel,” was also his physical trainer. At one point, Webb asked Smollett if he had exchanged any messages with Osundairo related to working out the night of the alleged attack. Smollett’s response was no, but that “there’s also no messages about an attack and I’m on trial for an attack that I didn’t do.”

These were, again, very basic questions about recorded evidence and Smollett’s version of events. Yet he was reacting on the stand as if he really had just been called “f— Empire n—.”

By comparison, Smollett’s lawyers went in on Abel Osundairo not with questions about timeline or evidence, but with assertions that he’s a closeted homosexual who must have wanted to violently assault Smollett out of some sick sense of self-hatred. Osundairo was asked about “dating” Smollett (he said he didn’t), about a time that they allegedly masturbated together at a Chicago bathhouse (he denied it ever occurred) and about the “sexual tension” between them (he said he wasn’t aware it existed).

I have no clue if Osundairo is a closeted gay, but if the point was to provoke him by insinuating that he is, Smollett’s team failed to a humiliating degree.

When one person in a trial gets testy because he’s asked to explain himself and another sits still while being accused of sexual deviancy, it should serve as a small indicator as to who may not be exactly the most forthcoming.

Smollett may be the first person to have ever thought he could out-scam a Nigerian. It doesn’t look like it worked, but perhaps he’ll have better luck with the jury.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/12/08/the-jussie-smollett-lesson-dont-try-scamming-a-nigerian/,2021-12-08
Race Hoaxer Jussie Smollett Convicted On Five Of Six Counts,"Former “Empire” star Jussie Smollett was convicted by a jury on five counts of disorderly conduct on Thursday over staging a hate crime against himself in 2019.

Smollett, 39, was indicted on six counts in 2019 after authorities investigating the celebrity’s claims of a brutally racist and homophobic attack found that the assault had been orchestrated by himself. According to Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, Smollett hired a pair of Nigerian brothers to stage a conditional attack that would later be treated as a virulent “hate crime,” earning the actor sympathy from politicians and media personalities.

“I come really, really hard against 45,” Smollett said in reference to then-President Donald Trump when explaining to ABC’s Robin Roberts why he felt he was attacked by two white men who screamed racial and homophobic slurs before they tied a noose around his neck and showered his skin with bleach, according to Smollett’s telling.

.@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching.

Smollett was only acquitted of one count of disorderly conduct, which referred to a report he gave to detective Robert Graves.

The five other counts on which Smollett was found guilty include telling Chicago Police Officer Muhammad Baig he had been victimized in a hate crime, telling the same officer he was a battery victim, making the same two claims to Officer Kimberly Murray, and making another battery claim to Murray the next evening.

Penalties for a single disorderly conduct charge ultimately remain under judicial discretion, but the crime is punishable with up to three years incarceration and a $25,000 fine.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/12/09/race-hoaxer-jussie-smollett-convicted-on-five-of-six-counts-after-staging-fake-chicago-attack-in-2019/,2021-12-09
"As 2021 Closes Decked In Democrat Disasters, Pelosi Clings To Jan. 6","Congressional Democrats are headed into an already historically hostile midterm cycle with all the warnings of a GOP blowout even mightier than the electoral landslide inaugurated by the Tea Party movement ten years ago.

An anemic economy handicapped by soaring inflation and high-power prices fed by progressive policy, coupled with a raging virus Democrats pledged to shut down, have continued to antagonize an electorate poised to return a proper punishment at the ballot box. Never mind the administration’s failures on the southern border and in Afghanistan.

In the absence of any successes from a unified government, Pelosi’s go-to strategy for the uphill midterms battle has become vilifying political dissidents, and her House Select Committee on Jan. 6 is the vehicle. She doesn’t care that those political dissidents are complicit in the same form of domestic terrorism Democrats justified for years.

On Tuesday, The Washington Post reported just how much more of a show trial the Jan. 6 is about to become.

“Committee investigating Jan. 6 attack plans to begin a more public phase of its work in the new year,” the Post headlined.

“The House Committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol plans to begin holding public hearings in the new year to tell the story of the insurrection from start to finish while crafting an ample interim report on its findings by summer, as it shifts into a more public phase of its work.”

The timeline is no coincidence as gas prices push towards $4 a gallon by Memorial Day after eclipsing seven-year highs this fall. After Democrats launched a snap impeachment in the immediate aftermath of the Capitol attack, spending weeks combing through the chaos in detail, followed by 12 months of a routine show trial wherein Democrats used fabricated evidence again, again, again, and again at every stage, is it necessary for the same people to “tell the story of the insurrection from start to finish” yet again? Of course not, but it’s also an election year, and Democrats are desperate.

With no winning issues to run on, Pelosi has been reduced to weaponizing the levers of government to seek retribution against political opponents and execute the Democrats’ latest hoax, all while covering the speaker’s own culpability in the riot.

Despite the failure of two impeachments, the collapse of the Kremlin collusion conspiracy and the botched Russian bounties scandal amplified by none other than Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who also happens to be Pelosi’s hand-picked vice chair on the Select Committee, Democrats, with the help of a complicit media establishment, have won good mileage on their endless conspiracies smearing Republicans. There are Americans today who no doubt still believe Justice Brett Kavanaugh is a serial gang rapist, or that President Donald Trump, subservient to Kremlin orders, once relished in Moscow prostitutes soaking themselves in golden showers.

The explicit effort to traumatize the events on Jan. 6 into the American psyche on the same level as the 9/11 terrorist attacks which killed nearly 3,000 people, has become not only a distraction from the sustained carnage inflicted by left-wing anarchists throughout 2020, but a mechanism to secure a legislative mandate through maintained control of the lower chamber. That’s what makes Cheney’s participation leading Pelosi’s politicized probe operating without any legislative purpose so offensive: it’s not just an attack on Donald Trump, it’s a crusade against the Republican voter.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/12/30/as-2021-closes-decked-in-democrat-disasters-pelosi-clings-to-jan-6/,2021-12-30
Jan. 6 Was Neither A Terrorist Attack Nor An Insurrection,"Image Credit Flickr/John Brighenti

Anyone waiting for the first hysterical 9/11 comparison on the first anniversary of Jan. 6 didn’t have to wait long.

“Certain dates echo throughout history, including dates that instantly remind all who have lived through them — where they were and what they were doing when our democracy came under assault,” Vice President Kamala Harris said early Thursday morning. “Dates that occupy not only a place on our calendars, but a place in our collective memory. December 7th, 1941. September 11th, 2001. And January 6th, 2021.”

A few minutes later, President Biden compared it to the Civil War.

“Rioters rampaging, waving for the first time inside this Capitol, the confederate flag that symbolized the cause to destroy America, to rip us apart,” he said. “Even during the Civil War, that never, ever happened. But it happened here in 2021.”

This, Biden gravely intoned, represented a “dagger at the throat of America, at American democracy.” It was nothing short of an “armed insurrection.”

Not an Insurrection

Only it wasn’t, according to prosecutors and courts of law. Of the more than 725 people arrested and charged in connection with the Jan. 6 incident, none have been charged with “rebellion or insurrection” under 18 U.S. Code § 2383.

The law, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in federal prison, applies to “whoever incites, sets on foot, assists, or engages in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof, or gives aid or comfort thereto.”

If, as Biden and Harris (and pretty much every Democrat in America) suggest, the Jan. 6 defendants had stormed the Capitol with the intent of overturning the results of the 2020 presidential election, then why have none of them been charged with it?

Not Sedition

In addition, if, as they have been alleging for a year now, this insurrection was really aimed at toppling the incoming Biden government and reinstating Donald Trump as president, then why have none of the more than 725 defendants been charged with “seditious conspiracy” under 18 US Code § 2384?

The statute provides that “if two or more persons … conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States, or to levy war against them, or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority thereof, they shall each be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.”

Doesn’t that behavior sound exactly like what Biden, Harris, and the rest of the Democratic Party have claimed happened on Jan. 6? Didn’t a group of conspirators — egged on and perhaps even directly guided by former President Trump — take the Capitol by force in an attempt at destroying the government (as well as democracy itself)?

And if Trump — or anyone else supposedly fomenting and guiding the “insurrection” — was indeed advocating for the overthrow of the Biden government, then why have they not been charged accordingly? 18 US Code § 2385 criminalizes “advocating the overthrow of government,” which it defines as knowingly or willfully advocat[ing], abet[ting], advis[ing], or teach[ing] the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying the government of the United States.”

Not a Terrorist Attack

After 365 days of criminal investigations, there has not been enough evidence to bring such charges against any of the more than 725 people arrested in connection with what is now hyperbolically (and laughably) considered a 9/11-like attack on the Capitol.

Were this an actual domestic terror attack, it would have been charged as such. It was not. Not one of the more than 725 Jan. 6 defendants has been charged with a terror-related offense. This will undoubtedly come as a shock to Biden, Harris, and any Democrat who believes their hysterical rhetoric.

Domestic terrorism is defined in federal law as “acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State” that “appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion, or to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping.”

If the Jan. 6 “terrorists” really had brought gallows into the Capitol with the intent of hanging then-Vice President Mike Pence if he didn’t acquiesce to their demands to stop the electoral vote certification, then why have none of them faced a domestic terrorism sentencing enhancement?

Under the law, such an act “calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion, or to retaliate against government conduct” is considered a “federal crime of terrorism” and can thus be used to enhance a federal sentence.

Wasn’t the whole point of the Jan. 6 “insurrection” to affect the certification of the election through intimidation and coercion? Why haven’t the charges or sentences reflected this?

The answer is as simple as it is predictable: The reality of Jan. 6 is nowhere near Democrats’ rhetoric about it. Jan. 6 was a riot and a national embarrassment, but it was not an insurrection, an attempted coup, or the worst attack on America since 9/11 or Pearl Harbor.

If it were, the criminal charges would have reflected it.

Biden Isn’t Even Hiding Designation Of Americans As ‘Domestic Terrorists’,"In my legal career, I often taught younger colleagues that good lawyers are like good generals—they win by picking the terrain upon which they fight. The duke of Wellington won the battle of Waterloo, in part, because he chose the terrain and forced Napoleon to attack uphill, through the mud.

Lawyers’ terrain is the issues to be decided and the words they use to define those issues. Winning a complex legal case often depends upon who can define and shape the issues in the way that best favors them.

The same is true for politicians. To define the issues—the terrain upon which they wish to fight—politicians choose their words carefully.

The battlefield can be a negative characterization of one’s opponent. For example, if the opposition can be defined as racist, insurrectionist, terroristic, or any other inflammatory and pejorative label, the fight is won. The remaining issues are just the terms of the surrender.

Such efforts to define the terrain for the fight are going on now in the political wars over the January 6, 2021 insurrection , riot , attack on democracy , demonstration , whatever-you-choose-to-call-it. The real danger to our republic is the Joe Biden administration’s totalitarian effort to label millions of ordinary Americans as supporters of terrorists.

Smears Are a Control Tactic

In their effort to define the terrain, or the narrative, politicians and commentators have used a variety of overly simplistic descriptions to characterize all the hundreds of people who were on the Capitol grounds or in the Capitol building on January 6. Depending upon the person describing them, they are “insurrectionists,“ “rioters,“ “demonstrators,“ “goons,” and a variety of other things. When you hear the label, you know the speaker’s political views.

The primary labels Democrats have deployed are “insurrectionists,“ and “terrorists,” even though not a single person there that day has yet been charged with insurrection or terrorism (although U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland has left that door open). It is a sign of the success of the Democrats’ choice of this as their terrain that such inflammatory labels are now routinely used, including by those who know better.

Even Sen. Ted Cruz recently referred to all those entering the Capitol building that day as “violent terrorists.” Although Cruz has attempted to backtrack, it shows how an opponent founders if you have defined the terrain upon which you fight.

Nobody There Was a Terrorist

Most of these labels are accurate for some of the people present that day, although “terrorists“ is not. However, when applied to all of those present, as is the usual practice, the labels are inaccurate and misleading. When it is necessary to describe the January 6, 2021 group as a whole, I prefer “RPGs,” for rioters, protesters, and gawkers.

No doubt, some in the crowd should be characterized and charged as “rioters.” But although their number is unknown, it is highly likely that some were FBI agents or informants, or, as documented by The Federalist, other agents provocateurs, perhaps including the mysterious Ray Epps. But the federal government has stonewalled requests from GOP members of Congress for more information about this.

Likewise, it cannot be seriously disputed that many in the crowd are more accurately described as “protesters.” They are not unlike many of the hundreds, if not thousands, of political dissidents who have previously invaded public buildings, including the U.S. Capitol, to protest a variety of things, from the Vietnam War to the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. As The Federalist has documented, many of the protester RPGs are less culpable than were many of the protestors who came before them.

Even though the government has refused to release most of the video footage of the events of that day, there are videos and reports of people freely entering the Capitol building through doors and barricades opened by Capitol Police, snapping selfies with police officers, walking calmly between the velvet rope lines in statuary hall while taking photos and videos, and generally gazing around like tourists on any other day.

In short, describing all the RPGs as “insurrectionists” or “terrorists” trying to destroy “our democracy” is clearly inaccurate, but is Democrats’ chosen line of attack. It defines their enemies. After all, what truly independent voter would not be against insurrectionists and terrorists who engaged in an “armed insurrection” intended to “subvert the Constitution”?

The War on Trump Is a War on His Voters

This is an intentional strategy with a malevolent purpose: Former President Trump and his supporters must be utterly destroyed. Make no mistake about it: Democrats’ goal is the total destruction of former President Trump, any GOP politician who questions either the way the 2020 elections were conducted or the tactics being employed by the House January 6 committee, and anyone who supported Trump.

No quarter is to be given to Republicans unless, like Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, they fully support the Democrat war on anyone suspected of being insufficiently opposed to the former president who has questions about the propriety of the 2020 election, or even who just opposes the lawless tactics being used against Trump’s supporters.

If the Democrats and their media allies succeed in defining their terrain and enemies as an insurrection supported by terrorists who, in Joe Biden’s words, want to “subvert the Constitution,” then the full force of the federal government can be brought to bear against them. This will include ordinary American citizens whose only “crime” has been to support Trump or raise questions about the propriety of Biden’s election, or, as we have seen, those who just oppose the Democrats’ pet projects, such as the indoctrination of school children with racists philosophy, by showing up and protesting at school board meetings.

Pursuant to standard counter-terrorism doctrine, and like the terrorists that Biden and his supporters claim they are, they and their supporters must be hunted down, harassed, imprisoned, bankrupted, excluded from any office, and ostracized from polite society until they have been “reprogrammed.”

Democrats Are Crystal Clear About Their Aims

This month, the University of Chicago sponsored a forum introduced by President Obama’s chief strategist, David Alexrod, that included disgraced former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, Democrat Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Washington Post “national security reporter,” and a bobble-headed university professor who spent the better part of an hour nodding in agreement with everything anyone else said.

As Evita Duffy chronicled in The Federalist, the forum participants made it clear that everyone who set foot in the Capitol building on January 6, 2020, was a “domestic terrorist” guilty of “insurrection,” even though no one has been charged with either. Accordingly, all must be prosecuted.

The panelists are teaching that the “combustible mass” of Americans who “harbor insurrectionist sentiments” are not just the “traditional threats” from a radical fringe. Rather, they are from “mainstream America,” and they are fomenting “collective political violence.” According to McCabe “national security” is implicated because these people are engaged in a “wave of political violence that is not just confined to the Capitol” but is “going on in school boards around the country.”

This panel of “experts” compared these “mainstream Americans” to al-Qaeda, the Fort Hood shooter (three murdered, 14 injured), the Boston Marathon bombers (three killed, hundreds wounded), and Slobodan Milošević, the Serbian war criminal charged with genocide and ethnic cleansing.

Joe Kent, a highly experienced veteran of sophisticated counter-terrorist special operations and a congressional candidate from Washington, put the dynamic plainly in a recent interview with Tucker Carlson. Referring to Vice President Kamala Harris’ comparison of January 6 to Pearl Harbor and 9/11, Kent said, “I fought these wars before and I’ve seen this playbook run before. What Kamala Harris is doing, what Joe Biden is doing, is they’re taking very powerful imagery and they’re saying that the attack on Pearl Harbor, the attack on 9/11, this is the same thing that took place on January 6th because that allows people to compare Trump supporters to Nazis, to actual members of al- Qaeda, and with that imagery comes the justification to turn the tools of the state against them.”

Kent’s 20-plus years as an Army Ranger, Special Forces Green Beret, and intelligence officer gives him the experience to recognize the counter-terrorism strategy being employed by the Biden administration against “mainstream America.”

Texas Synagogue Attack Smells Like More Evidence Of FBI Corruption,"After all hostages were released from Beth Isreal Synagogue in Colleyville, Texas where they were held for 11 hours on Saturday, FBI Special Agent in Charge Matt DeSarno from the Dallas field office told reporters that the gunman was “focused on one issue” that was unrelated to the Jewish community, and that they are “continuing to work to find the motive.”

That “one issue” is presumably the imprisonment of Aafia Siddiqui, also known as “Lady Al Qaeda,” a Pakistani national who is serving an 86-year sentence in a prison less than 20 miles from the synagogue. The gunman, Malik Faisal Akram, a 44-year-old British citizen, was heard shouting about Siddiqui’s release and demanding to speak to his “sister,” a terrorist whose release mainstream Muslim groups have recently been lobbying for. Akram died of gunshot wounds after the hostages were released.

The FBI’s statement that they “are continuing to work to find the motive” is another example of the agency’s ineptitude on multiple levels. The first is simply their refusal to even hint at the crime’s motivation as antisemitism, which is the only accurate label for an attack at a synagogue on Shabbat where a rabbi and three congregants are held hostage.

“If the law enforcement community doesn’t understand what’s going on, they’re not going to be able to address the fallout from this,” said Kenneth Marcus, the founder and chairman of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law. “This was not a mere slip-up. It is symptomatic of a widespread failure with law enforcement to understand the problems of antisemitism and anti-Zionism,” he told Fox News.

But perhaps even more frustrating is the FBI’s corrupt obsession and use of resources on cases that suit their political fancy, like the Jan. 6 Capitol riot or “Operation Varsity Blues” (catching rich people scamming to get their underachieving kids into top universities), while letting serious violent threats to Americans fly under the radar.

The BBC reports Akram arrived in the United States via New York’s JFK International Airport two weeks ago and he is believed to have bought a handgun used in the incident after his arrival, which would have required him to pass a federal background check, a system run by none other than the FBI.

The BBC report also said the FBI would be conducting investigations in Pakistan, “where it is understood Akram had been recently – to establish if he was acting alone or was supported by others.”

Perhaps he bought the gun “on the street,” as President Joe Biden claimed Sunday, but that still leaves questions as to what the FBI ought to know about who is helping foreigners who recently traveled to Pakistan purchase illegal firearms.

Even with the details sparse on what the FBI could or could not have known about the gunman, this caught-off-guard response from federal agents is sadly what Americans have come to expect from our top law enforcement agency.

The FBI’s failures as an entire institution in recent years are too long to list here, but looking at just the mass shootings and explosions alone that happened after the FBI was aware of the assailants as potential threats is frightening. My colleague Joy Pullmann has documented a number of instances in which the FBI was aware of threats before the violence occurred and did nothing. She writes:

For example, the 2009 Fort Hood shooter, who killed 13; the Boston Marathon bombers of 2013 who killed three and injured 264; and the Pulse nightclub shooter who killed 49 people and wounded 53 more. All were known to the FBI and several had been interviewed by the FBI before they went on killing sprees. The FBI had also been warned numerous times about the Parkland, Florida school shooter, before he killed 17 and injured 17 more in 2018. It also knew beforehand about the 2018 Nashville, Tennessee Waffle House shooter, who killed four and injured two more, and the 2020 Nashville RV bomber.

The FBI also has a bad track record at categorizing motives and crime, just as in Colleyville. Last spring, it was brought to light by Republican congressmen that after the 2017 congressional baseball shooting, the FBI told lawmakers the mass assassination attempt was officially designated as a “suicide by cop.” The Fort Hood attack carried out as a radical Islamist was designated by the FBI as “workplace violence.”

Whether it’s their inability to move on threats before they occur, or their corrupt labels after the fact, the FBI is notorious for botching both. In the Texas synagogue case, they’ve already missed the mark on one. It will be wholly unsurprising if new details eventually confirm the other.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/01/18/texas-synagogue-attack-smells-like-more-evidence-of-fbi-corruption/,2022-01-18
FBI's Explanation For Attack On Texas Synagogue Reeks Of Politicization,"Image Credit Flickr/Sammy Six

In the wake of last weekend’s terrorist attack that targeted a Texas synagogue, a highly trained FBI professional said, in effect, the attack had nothing to do with the Jewish community. That he felt the need or was trained to make such a risibly false statement needs to be investigated.

On January 15, a 44-year-old man, later identified as Malik Faisal Akram, entered Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, Texas, and took four hostages. He demanded the release of a Pakistani national, Aafia Siddiqui, who is serving an 86-year federal sentence for assault and attempted murder of federal agents and military personnel.

The intent of Akram’s attack was clearly terrorism — the definition being “unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.” Akram died of gunshot wounds received as the hostage ordeal came to an end, with all four hostages emerging unharmed. Had it not been for Covid-19 concerns, there may have been far more people, as most congregants were worshiping from home on Zoom.

FBI’s Incredulous Explanation

In his post-incident news conference, Matthew J. DeSarno, the FBI’s special agent in charge of the Dallas field office, said of Akram’s attack, “We do believe from our engagement with this subject that he was singularly focused on one issue, and it was not specifically related to the Jewish community.”

When I heard DeSarno’s remarks, I was immediately incredulous. When some intrepid reporters asked about motives again, DeSarno doubled down, asserting, “I’m not ready to add any more about the demands set [by the hostage taker], except that they were specifically focused on one issue that was not specifically threatening to the Jewish community.”

Akram was heard to say via the live stream that operated from the synagogue for much of the incident that he chose it because he thought it was the closest assemblage of Jews to the federal facility holding Siddiqui. There are about 1,000 churches in the Fort Worth area within a half-hour drive of Siddiqui’s place of incarceration, compared to seven Jewish centers of worship — but sure, Special Agent DeSarno, the terrorism was “not specifically threatening to the Jewish community.”

Siddiqui came to local attention just last month when the Dallas-Fort-Worth chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) held an event called “In Pursuit of Freedom” about 35 miles away from Colleyville’s Congregation Beth Israel and 55 miles from where Siddiqui is being held. The event called for Siddiqui’s release with the incendiary claim that she had been “kidnapped, ripped apart from her children, shot at, renditioned to the U.S., and is currently serving an 86-year prison sentence for a crime she did not commit.”

This is potent propaganda. CAIR condemned the hostage incident as it took place.

Siddiqui’s Anti-Semitism

DeSarno, a former Army infantry officer with the First Cavalry Division in Fort Hood, Texas — where, seven years after DeSarno joined the FBI, Muslim terrorist Nidal Hasan fatally shot 13 people and injured more than 30 others — was promoted to deputy assistant director of the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division in 2017.

DeSarno is supposed to know terrorism inside and out. As such, it is highly implausible to suggest that DeSarno didn’t know about Siddiqui’s own anti-Semitic rantings during her trial, where she refused to cooperate with the three lawyers hired by the Pakistani embassy to augment her two public defenders, on the grounds they were Jewish. Siddiqui even demanded that there be no Jewish people on the jury and wanted all jurors to be DNA-tested to check “if they have a Zionist or Israeli background.”

But, of course, Siddiqui’s words and Akram’s deeds are not “related to the Jewish community.”

Even President Joe Biden suggested the attack had intent beyond Siddiqui when he said, “This was an act of terror… and not only was related to someone who had been arrested… 15 years ago and had been in jail for 10 years.” The FBI changed its tune hours later, releasing a new statement on Sunday night admitting that the attack was a “terrorism-related matter, in which the Jewish community was targeted.”

Biden also said Akram bought his gun “on the street,” feeding into the left’s gun control narrative that firearms are too easily obtained in America. But that claim raises interesting questions that might be better answered if law enforcement were able to ask questions without fear of being labeled bigots. For instance, how does a foreign national in the United States for less than a month obtain a weapon? Did he have help?

Woke Indoctrination at the FBI

What we do know is that the FBI isn’t in the habit of promoting its agents to run large field offices if senior leadership doesn’t see them as right for the job. This raises the very disturbing likelihood that DeSarno, experienced as he is in counterterrorism, knew exactly what he was saying on Saturday before FBI headquarters walked it back on Sunday night after a hail of incredulous criticism.

DeSarno said what he said — “no connection to the Jewish community” — for a reason, that being that to say or think otherwise is now a thoughtcrime. Bright, ambitious professionals in federal service, whether civilians or military officers, have endured nearly 13 years of non-stop woke indoctrination from the left.

If you know what’s good for you and your career, there are simply some things you don’t say. And suggesting that attacks on America’s Jewish community might have something to do with them being Jewish might then lead to forbidden questions about who is doing a disproportionate amount of the attacking these days.

This brings to mind the nearly memory-holed December 2019 Jersey City terror attack by antisemitic black nationalists who, were it not for an unexpected encounter with local law enforcement, aimed to kill a large number of Jewish people and still ended up killing four people at a Kosher supermarket. Bari Weiss, in her indispensable substack “Common Sense,” noted on Jan. 17 that some black community leaders in Jersey City rationalized the attack:

Joan Terrell-Paige, a school official in the city, explained on her Facebook page that the murderers effectively had no choice. The Jews (she called them ‘brutes’) had caused their killers to murder them. ‘I believe they knew they would come out in body bags,’ she wrote of the killers. ‘What is the message they were sending? Are we brave enough to explore the answer to their message? Are we brave enough to stop the assault on the Black communities of America?’

In Weiss’s penultimate paragraph, she notes, “Jews thrived in an America that had confidence in its goodness. Jews are not safe—no one is—in one which does not.”

Should Republicans regain one or both chambers of Congress in the 2022 elections, one key task, among the many, needs to be added to the “to do” list. There must be a series of hearings probing whether federal employees have been under official pressure to self-censor so as not to transgress against leftist articles of faith, facts be damned—or risk missing out on that promotion.

To the extent Congress finds this is so, it may be too late to reform or undo years of ideological pressure. Instead, Congress needs to do two things: reclaim decision-making authority from an unelected elite increasingly contemptuous of the American public that pays their salaries and generous retirements; and reduce the size, and therefore the ability, of agencies like the FBI to interfere in the lives of law-abiding Americans — such as concerned parents of public school children.

"Virginia Delegate Lambasts Democrats' 'Sexist, Bigot, Racist' Smears","Virginia GOP Del. Nick Freitas blasted Democrats for routinely labeling Americans opposed to their radical agenda as bigots during a speech on Wednesday, noting how he and his constituents “have had it” with such denigrating smears.

“I’ve never gone on this floor and challenged the faith of an elected official because I disagreed with them on policy,” he said while speaking on the floor of the House of Delegates. “I’ve never gone on this floor, Mr. Speaker, and suggested that the other side of the aisle were racists … I’ve never suggested they were sexist because they didn’t agree with my particular policy positions. But I’m keeping a running tally so far of this session. … Almost every day, someone on the other side of the aisle either gets up and either subtly, or comes right out and suggests, that if you don’t agree with them on policy, then you’re not a Christian, you’re a sexist, you’re a bigot, you’re a racist.”

Freitas went on to note how such slimy tactics were tried during the 2021 Virginia elections, citing parents’ concerns over the pushing of neo-Marxist concepts like critical race theory in public schools as a prime example.

“You had a lot of parents coming to their local school officials asking questions about what was going on in their schools. And the initial response was, ‘Oh, it’s not there,’” he said. “And then when they saw evidence that it was based off of what their kids were coming home and saying to them, and they went back and reissued the concern, then they got told, ‘Oh well, then you must be a racist.’ Because that has been the repeated narrative coming from certain members of the other side of the aisle and there’s been a lot of times we’ve sat here politely and just took it. Mr. Speaker, not this time.”

“But if you’re going to question the faith of the intentions of anybody that happens to disagree with you on policy, then you don’t get to lecture us on compassion, tolerance, or an open debate,” he added.

The impassioned remarks from Freitas came in response to comments made by fellow delegate Don Scott Jr., who claimed that Gov. Glenn Youngkin wasn’t a Christian because of the policies he’s implemented since taking office.

“The governor-elect at the time, he came in this chamber with the freshman who were being trained and taught and talked about how we do things on the [House] floor. And the first things that I recall him saying was that he had a strong prayer life and that he was praying for everybody, ” the Democrat said. “And so far what I’ve seen from his day-one activities is not someone who is a man of faith, not a Christian, but someone who wants to divide the commonwealth. Someone that wants to cause division.”

“I know the truth hurts. I don’t want to make you cry, like saying critical race theory, cause I know it hurts your feelings,” he added in reference to mounting objections from numerous House delegates.

Scott Jr.’s attacks were not isolated nor unique to Virginia; they’ve become characteristic of the modern left, whose sycophants throughout legacy media and the political class habitually smear their political opponents as bigots for daring to hold different views.

For instance, when asked back in November by Politico’s Anita Kumar if negative criticism of Vice President Kamala Harris was rooted in sexism and racism because she’s the first woman and woman of color to hold the position, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki was quick to respond with an emphatic “yes,” adding, “[C]riticism from the outside, absolutely.”

“I do think that it has been easier, and harsher, from some in the right wing who have gone after her because she is the first woman, the first woman of color,” Psaki said. “I’m not suggesting anyone will acknowledge that publicly, but I think there’s no question that the type of attacks — the attacks on her that certainly, being the first she is many times over, is part of that.”

The same types of attacks were launched at Republicans who decried the 2020 Black Lives Matter riots, parents who oppose critical race theory concepts infiltrating their kids’ schools, and those who reject the idea that health care and other services should be prioritized based on skin color, to name a few.

California School District Tells Kids: ‘Attacking Whiteness Is Not Enough’,"Image Credit ArtisticOperations / Pixabay

A now-deleted portion of the Riverside, Califonia school district’s website obtained by The Federalist displays that the district promoted an essay that attacks people based on their inborn skin color. The essay, titled “Decentering Whiteness” by Jeff Hitchcock and Charley Flint, claimed that “attacking whiteness is not enough.” It sought to divide people on the basis of their race and argued that “whiteness” should be pushed to “the margin,”

Riverside Unified School District promoted the essay at least three separate times, under the “Professional Learning,” “Community Engagement,” and “Culture and Climate” sections of their Equity, Access, and Community Engagement resources page, according to screenshots.

The Federalist previously revealed that both Riverside Superintendent Renee Hill and Board of Education member Tom Hunt lied about the district teaching critical race theory. One parent from the district, who wished to remain unnamed, told The Federalist that the resources list that contained “Decentering Whiteness” was removed from the website following the exposé of the district’s dishonesty.

When asked why the resources had been removed, Communication Director Diana Meza stated that the district is “updating the Equity, Access & Community Engagement google site and landing page, the page should be back up soon.”

The school district has charge of nearly 40,000 students, according to federal data, and 35 percent of those students are white. School families’ median income is significantly above the national average, at approximately $73,000 per year.

Decentering Whiteness

The removed 19-page “resources” document, which can be viewed here, not only condemned “whiteness” but served as a guidebook for how institutions can fight it, so that “whiteness itself can be made more marginal.” The paper explained, “Decentering whiteness, as we envision it, is a collective process that can take place in organizations, sectors of society, personal lives, etc., over periods of days, months, years and generations.”

While launching into both anti-white attacks and blatant attempts to divide people on the basis of their immutable characteristics, the paper engaged in race essentialism. It cast race as a defining rather than incidental characteristic when it tells readers to “Assume whiteness, and race, always structures our experience, and thus needs to be consciously considered as part of any social process.”

White people are also openly villainized in the materials. One line reads, “white culture has, on balance, been based on principles of conquest and exploitation” while another says that in the attempt to marginalize whiteness, “simply attacking whiteness is not enough.”

The document did not oppose attacking “whiteness” out of an opposition to racism, nor did it express any concern over the potential fallout of seizing on racial fault lines for socio-political ends. Rather, it simply argued that openly attacking whiteness wouldn’t be strategically effective. It remarked “Simply attacking whiteness is not enough to accomplish this goal. Assaults on whiteness, depending on their nature, may have the effect of confirming and solidifying the central position of whiteness in American society.”

Lighter skin color has been and continues to be one of the prime targets of critical race theory. Noel Ignatiev, a Marxist Harvard professor who is cited in “Decentering Whiteness,” infamously claimed that “treasonous to whiteness is loyalty to humanity.”

He also remarked, “Make no mistake about it: we intend to keep bashing the dead white males, and the live ones, and the females too, until the social construct known as ‘the white race’ is destroyed—not ‘deconstructed’ but destroyed.”

Perhaps most sinister, “Decentering Whiteness” clearly sought to encourage racial division and even racial conflict, calling on a multiracial coalition to “displace” whiteness. It read “It will take a multiracial effort to displace whiteness, one that includes people from all racial/cultural groups.”

How exactly any of this rhetoric benefits the students or staff at Riverside Unified School District is entirely unclear. The presence of this material in a school climate is in fact both un-American and undeniably harmful, not only to the white people who are maligned by it but also those of all other racial backgrounds whom the article attempts to conscript into a race-based power struggle.

The Supreme Court Did Not Make ‘Attack On Voting Rights’,"On Feb. 7, in a 5-4 decision the Supreme Court entered a stay of a lower court’s order directing Alabama to redraw its congressional districts ahead of the upcoming primary elections. The Supreme Court has consistently held that the federal courts should not override a state’s election law close to an election. Yet in a dissent joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, Justice Elena Kagan presented the high court’s stay as an attack on Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, black Alabamians’ electoral power, and “all of American democracy.”

Democrats and the left-leaning media have likewise framed Monday’s joint decision in Merrill v. Milligan and Merrill v. Caster as “further undercut[ting] the Voting Rights Act.” Contrary to such claims, however, the Supreme Court’s decision yesterday did not address the merits of the Voting Rights Act claim, but merely considered the propriety of the lower court issuing an injunction so close to the election. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in a concurrence signed on to by Justice Samuel Alito, stressed that point, while also countering many of the claims Justice Kagan made in her dissent.

To understand these competing arguments, as well as to realize how disingenuous are Kagan and Democrats’ claims that the decision is an attack on the voting rights of black Alabamians, requires both a backdrop to these lawsuits and an historical refresher concerning the state’s congressional districting.

How We Got Here

Following the 2020 census, the Republican-controlled Alabama legislature redrew the state’s congressional map. While Alabama neither gained nor lost congressional seats, the legislature drafted new borders for the seven congressional districts to account for population shifts and to equalize population between the districts. The state did this by beginning with the prior map and then altering the boundaries of the prior districts, succeeding in several cases in eliminating county splits between districts.

After passage of Alabama’s 2021 congressional redistricting plan, three groups of plaintiffs filed separate suited against John H. Merrill, the Alabama secretary of state. Together the three lawsuits alleged the 2021 redistricting plan violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act (VRA), although the Equal Protection claim fell to the wayside during the lower court proceedings. Instead, the parties and the court focused on the VRA, with the plaintiffs seeking a preliminary injunction under Section 2.

Section 2 of the VRA provides that “[n]o voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State . . . in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color . . .” In the context of redistricting plans, case law holds that a state violates Section Two “if its districting plan provides ‘less opportunity’ for racial minorities [than for other members of the electorate] ‘to elect representatives of their choice.’”

For instance, “a plaintiff may allege a § 2 violation in a single-member district if the manipulation of districting lines fragments [cracks] politically cohesive minority voters among several districts or packs them into one district or a small number of districts, and thereby dilutes the voting strength of members of the minority population.”

In a comprehensive 200-plus page opinion, a three-judge panel of the Northern District of Alabama concluded the plaintiffs had shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their Section 2 VRA claim. The court then entered a preliminary injunction directing the state legislature to, within 14 days, or by February 11, 2022, “enact a remedial plan” that would “include two districts in which Black voters either comprise a voting-age majority or something quite close to it.” In absence of the Alabama legislature doing so, the court indicated it would hire, at the state’s expense, “an eminently qualified expert to draw on an expedited basis a map that complies with federal law for use in Alabama’s 2022 congressional elections.”

Alabama requested a stay of the order, When the district court denied the motion, the state filed a motion for an emergency stay before the Supreme Court. As noted above, the Supreme Court granted that motion in a 5-4 decision, with Justice John Roberts dissenting separately from the dissent authored by Justice Kagan that justices Breyer and Sotomayor joined.

The Justices Explain Why

Under normal circumstances the granting (or denying) of a stay would merit no opinion—merely a simple order of the fait accompli. But here, likely prompted by Justice Kagan’s dissent, Justice Kavanaugh, joined by Justice Alito, explained why they voted to stay the lower court decision. That discussion exposes Democrats’ claim that the court is attacking the VRA as unfounded.

“As background,” Justice Kavanaugh wrote, the lower court “ordered that Alabama’s congressional districts be completely redrawn within a few short weeks,” before absentee ballots must be mailed for the upcoming primary elections. But first, as the court summarized, candidates must meet filing deadlines, without knowing for sure in which district to file, or maybe even in which district they live.

State and local election officials also need to prepare for the elections and, Kavanaugh noted, the lower court’s “order would require heroic efforts by those state and local authorities.” Even then, it “likely would not be enough to avoid chaos and confusion.”

That is why, as Justice Kavanaugh explained, the Supreme “Court has repeatedly stated that federal courts ordinarily should not enjoin a state’s election laws close to an election.” “That principle,” Kavanaugh stressed, “reflects a bedrock tenet of election law: When an election is close at hand, the rules of the road must be clear and settled. Late judicial tinkering with election laws can lead to disruption and to unanticipated and unfair consequences for candidates, political parties, and voters, among others.”

It was for those reasons—reasons of time—the stay issued. As Kavanaugh reiterated, “the stay order is not a ruling on the merits, but instead simply stays the District Court’s injunction pending a ruling on the merits.” “The stay order does not make or signal any change to voting rights law,” Kavanaugh stressed.

Not a Harm to ‘All of American Democracy’

Kagan argues otherwise in her dissent, but, really, her analysis came down to the fact that the lower court crafted a detailed and thorough analysis of the issues. But that doesn’t make it correct. It also does not overcome the Supreme Court’s consistent position that a stay is appropriate this close to an election. Kagan’s claim that the stay harms black Alabamians and, more broadly, “all of American democracy,” besides being overwrought hyperbole, is unsupported by the history of Alabama’s congressional districts.

For almost 50 years, Alabama’s congressional districts have remained very similar. In 1970, when Alabama dropped from eight to seven congressional districts, the state carved up districts based broadly on geography, but in the 1990s a new map was established by a court after it ordered the state congressional plan to contain a majority-black district.

Known as the 1992 plan, it remained in effect, with only minor changes coming into play in the 2000 and 2010 redistricting cycles. Significantly, the U.S. Department of Justice precleared both the 2001 and 2011 maps as consistent with the VRA—and both of those maps included only one majority-black district. As seen below, the 2021 redistricting map closely mirrors those previously approved districts, maintaining the one majority-black district, but with less zigging and zagging into the counties.

Yet now justices Kagan, Breyer, and Sotomayor pretend that keeping the status quo of one majority-black district until the Section 2 VRA claim can be resolved on the merits is an attack on black Alabamanian’s voting rights and our country’s democracy.

It is not. It is a stay. Nothing more and nothing less.

"Georgetown Law Protects Racist Comments, Punishes Anti-Racist Ones","Constitutional law scholar Ilya Shapiro is on administrative leave from Georgetown Law School amid being investigated for criticizing President Biden’s choice to select a Supreme Court nominee on the bases of sex and race. His suspension is outrageously hypocritical in light of many law professors’ ugly, racist attacks heaped upon conservative judges, especially Justice Clarence Thomas, that received little or no criticism in the legal academic community.

Shapiro is being investigated for tweeting: “Objectively best pick for Biden is Sri Srinivasan, who is solid prog & v smart. . . . But alas doesn’t fit into the latest intersectionality hierarchy so we’ll get lesser black woman.” Yes, Shapiro used the inartful phrase “lesser black woman” because President Biden announced he would only consider black women candidates to be his nominee. In the context of his tweet, however, Ilya was clearly not saying that a black woman nominee could not be an excellent choice.

In contrast to Shapiro’s opposition to racism, many law professors have engaged in openly racist attacks on justices, with little to no professional repercussions. Such criticism of Thomas is an especially clear example of this double standard in the profession and at Georgetown.

Many law professors, including at Georgetown Law, have been unapologetically vicious in their racism towards Thomas. According to a review by Georgetown Law Professor Charles Abernathy of the book, “We Won’t Go Back: Making The Case For Affirmative Action” (1997) by then Georgetown Law professors Charles R. Lawrence III & Mari J. Matsuda:

[Justice Thomas] is said to be “a ‘handkerchief head’ and ‘a chicken-and-biscuit-eating Uncle Tom.’ While these slurs against Justice Clarence Thomas are quoted as the words of others, Lawrence reports them — repeatedly — with the same mixture of glee and anger common in epithet calling. Finally, in the author’s own words, Justice Thomas is lashed for the ‘extremity of his betrayal’ of blacks. [footnotes omitted]

That is what racism actually looks like, in full bloom. Proper outrage over such sentiments ought to far exceed the faux uproar over Ilya’s opposition to racial and sexual preferences in hiring. Yet I am unaware of Lawrence being publicly chastised or put on administrative leave by the dean of Georgetown Law School, or of anyone at Georgetown, other than Abernathy, saying a word of public criticism about his statements.

The phenomenal Bari Weiss uncovered a real gem of hateful speech from Georgetown Law Professor Carol Christine Fair, who tweeted during the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation: “Look at this chorus of entitled white men justifying a serial rapist’s arrogated entitlement. All of them deserve miserable deaths while feminists laugh as they take their last gasps. Bonus: we castrate their corpses and feed them to swine? Yes.”

In stark contrast to its treatment of Shapiro regarding his poorly worded tweet, for which he has already apologized, Georgetown Law School came to Fair’s defense, saying: “Our policy does not prohibit speech based on the person presenting ideas or the content of those ideas even when those ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable.” To her credit, Fair would have Georgetown give Shapiro the same broad latitude to speak his mind that she received for her far more incendiary comments.

Beyond the selectively sensitive faculty at Georgetown, many others in the legal academy have gleefully, and without apparent consequence, expressed racist contempt for Thomas. Since working on Justice Thomas’s confirmation as a lawyer in the White House counsel’s office, I have been appalled by the frequency and vehemence of the ad hominem, racist attacks on him.

A few others, such as Professor Tomiko Brown-Nagin, have laudably objected to such attacks on Justice Thomas, as reflected in this article on a speech she gave in 2005 at the University of Virginia:

Brown-Nagin said she disagrees with Thomas on many issues. . . . Nevertheless, she chose to take a contrarian position because much of the rhetoric about Thomas’s jurisprudence is exaggerated and intellectually dishonest. Thomas has been called ‘someone who looks black, but thinks white,’ she said, and an ‘Uncle Tom’ who ‘obeys’ Justice Antonin Scalia. A recent article by a legal academic called Thomas even worse — he was a ‘Sambo’ for cultivating good relations with whites for his own advantage and to the disadvantage of other blacks. ‘I think the rhetoric is inhumane…It’s dehumanizing to Thomas as well as to all of us,’ Brown-Nagin said. ‘In my view, it’s well beyond what anyone needs to do to make their point.’

Yet, apart from a few criticisms from within the legal academy, I do not recall a single law professor being rebuked by his faculty or dean, suspended, or fired for such intemperate and baseless comments. I do not think they should be, any more than Shapiro should be punished. The remedy for speech you dislike, or even despise, is more speech, not economic intimidation or cancellation.

Perhaps the reason Ilya’s statement is being treated differently than the attacks on Justice Thomas is because legal academics frequently agree that race should be a factor in both public and private decision making and even in assigning the views people are expected to hold. But much of the public, across all races, thinks otherwise. That is precisely why it is important to have a robust debate over President Biden’s (or any other president’s) reliance on race and sex as a selection criteria.

For example, polling on affirmative action in college admissions indicates that a significant majority of black Americans agree with Thomas’s and Ilya’s opposition to racial preferences and to racializing all aspects of American life. According to a Pew Research poll in 2019, 62 percent of blacks opposed having race be a factor at all in college admission criteria.

On other issues, such as voter ID laws and defund the police, the liberal and academic elite clearly do not represent the views of the majority of black Americans. A 2021 poll shows that 69 percent of blacks support voter ID requirements to vote. A 2021 poll showed only 28 percent of black Americans supported the defund the police movement.

But holding the “wrong” views on these issues will get you branded a racist on college and law school campuses. That the legal academy is so out of step with the sentiment of ordinary Americans even across racial boundaries makes it all the clearer that scholars like Ilya should have a place at Georgetown to challenge the received wisdom in academia on these questions without being accused of, let alone disciplined or fired for, “racial insensitivity.”

Shapiro’s tweet did not disparage anyone, including any potential Supreme Court nominee, on account of his or her race or sex. It would be the height of employing a double standard if Georgetown Law School Dean William Treanor took any additional adverse action against Shapiro for this tweet when many law professors continue to smear Justice Thomas as unqualified or a traitor to his race and are celebrated in the academic community.

Shapiro is a good man, an excellent scholar, and has a much-needed alternative point of view to contribute to the Georgetown Law community. Let’s see if Treanor has the integrity to live up to his professed “respect for diversity” and keep Shapiro.

NATO Intervention In Ukraine Could Spark Nuclear War. Here's How,"“How did we just kill a billion people?”

Over just three days, as I have done countless times over the last several years, a group of past and present senior U.S. government officials from both sides of the aisle gathered to wage a NATO-Russia war in a simulation at the end of 2019. In the course of what we called the NATO-Russia War of 2019, we estimated one billion people died. And if we aren’t careful, what happened in a simulation could happen if a NATO-Russia war erupts over Ukraine.

In fact, in the simulation I mentioned above from 2019, in which Russia invades Ukraine in a similar way as it did over the last week or so, not only does NATO get sucked in unintentionally, but Russia eventually releases nuclear weapons in its desperation. The result is an eventual escalation of bigger and more dangerous nuclear weapons whereby over one billion lives are lost.

But before we start staring into the abyss, allow me to explain the goal of such simulations. NATO clearly would have a massive conventional advantage in any war with Moscow, ensuring that in a straight-up fight Putin would lose. However, Russia has stated time and time again it will use nuclear weapons to defend its territory and its regime if it feels mortally threatened. Our simulation always seems to ask: Can we ever defeat Russian President Vladamir Putin in an armed conflict over Ukraine or the Baltics and not start a nuclear war in the process?

So far, over at least several years, and with at least 100 different participants that all held different ideas about war and political allegiances, the answer is a flat out no.

Setting the Scene for War

The scenario the group decided to test back in late 2019 was similar to today: Russia decided to invade Ukraine under the excuse that it is must defend Russian-speaking peoples that are being “oppressed” by Ukraine’s fascist government. In our scenario, we assumed Russia performs far more admirably than it does today but has more limited objectives, in that Moscow wants to connect Crimea to separatist regions in Eastern Ukraine that are under its effective control. We assumed that Russia does that quickly, achieving most of its military objectives in roughly four days.

But Ukraine does not give up so easily, just like in real life today. Ukrainian forces, after taking heavy losses, mount an impressive counterattack, whereby Russia loses over 100 tanks and over 2,500 soldiers. Images on social media show Russian armor ablaze, elite Su-35 fighter jets are shut down from the skies, and arms are now flowing in from the West in massive numbers.

Putin is outraged. He thought Ukraine would simply roll over, but he does not factor into his calculus the nearly decades-long training Kyiv received from the U.S. and NATO nor Ukraine’s military build-up for the last several years that was focused on this scenario.

Russia then decides that its limited military objectives were a mistake, and that all of Ukraine must be “demilitarized.” Moscow then launches a massive ballistic and cruise missile strike followed up by Russia’s air force launching its own shock and awe campaign, destroying a vast majority of Ukraine’s command and control structure, air force, air defense, and armored units in the process. At the same time, Russia starts surging troops to the borders of Ukraine in what looks like an imminent general invasion and occupation of the entire country.

The Spark

Here is where things take a turn for the worst. A Russian ballistic missile’s guidance system fails and crash-lands into NATO member Poland, killing 34 civilians as it tragically lands into a populated village along the Polish-Ukraine border. While the missile was not directed at Poland intentionally, pictures on social media show children crying for their mothers and bodies left unrecognizable, and demands for justice and revenge mount.

To its credit, Poland, which has its own tortured history with the Soviet Union and Russia, does its best to show restraint. While not responding with its own military, it leads an effort to see that Moscow pays a steep price for its aggression in Ukraine and actions, even unintentional, in Poland. Warsaw leads a diplomatic and economic boycott of Moscow resulting in Russia being kicked out of SWIFT as well as direct sanctions on Russian banks, similar to what we are seeing today.

In our scenario, Russia’s reaction is also swift. Moscow decides to launch a massive cyber attack on Poland, having based cyber warriors all throughout NATO territory, using their geography and proxy servers to mask the origin of the attack. Russia, in just two hours, takes off-line Poland’s entire electrical grid, banking sector, energy plants, and more — essentially taking Poland back to the stone age.

And this is where the nightmare begins. Even though attribution is hard to achieve, Poland appeals to NATO and starts to privately share its desire to invoke Article 5 of the NATO Charter, declaring that an attack on one is an attack on the entire alliance. NATO is worried, as there is debate on how far to punish Russia while also feeling as if they do not have a clear military objective amongst the member states as some want to respond to what happened to Poland while others feel they must intervene militarily in Ukraine.

The Response

Here is where NATO surprises everyone. The alliance decides to set up a limited no-fly zone around the Ukrainian city of Lviv to protect innocent civilians and refugees that are trapped and have nowhere to go. Russia is warned: NATO is not intervening in the conflict, but will ensure that its planes and the airspace around Lviv are protected. NATO does make clear its jets will be in the skies above Ukraine, but will not operate from Ukrainian territory.

In Moscow, Putin now gets a sense that NATO is destined to intervene on Ukraine’s side. Russia fears NATO will use this protected corridor as a base of operations to send ever more sophisticated weapons. And with its economy now in a tailspin due to sanctions, Putin feels the walls closing in him. Before NATO can impose its no-fly zone, Putin orders strikes on any remaining airfields and military assets around Lviv.

But here is where Putin miscalculates and sets the stage for a NATO-Russia war. Putin orders another massive cyber attack on the Baltic states’ military infrastructure, thinking that NATO will use the Baltics to stage an invasion of Russia.

This ends up being the last straw for NATO, which then decides direct intervention in Ukraine is necessary to push back against Russian aggression. Before even an announcement is made, Russian intelligence sees missile and troop movements that indicate an impending NATO attack and decide to strike first — with tactical nuclear weapons. NATO decides to respond in kind.

Russia then targets European cities with nuclear weapons, with NATO and America also responding in kind. What is left is nothing short of an apocalypse, with what we estimate is billion people dead.

No War Goes As Planned

In every scenario I have been a part of there is one common theme to all of them: When Vladimir Putin feels boxed in and feels Russia is directly threatened, usually from a mistake he makes on the battlefield, he decides to use whatever escalatory step he desires to try and make up for it.

While we may well soon see Ukraine and Russia find a diplomatic path out of this brutal war, both sides seem dug in. That means the chances for escalation like the above are high. And if Russia and NATO do become involved in direct conflict, Putin knows that in a conventional fight his regime would be defeated. That means Russia will choose nuclear war.

The only question in a NATO-Russia war seems obvious: how many millions or billions of people would die?

"DC Has Prevented Nuclear Defense, So We Must Protect Ourselves","At the heart of a free society is the ability to engage in civil discourse about, among other things, the defense of one’s civilization. This is not, unfortunately, possible in America at present. Today we are living in the age of political narratives that are nothing more than lies told to serve some political end.

The current narrative is that the national security of the United States requires the defense of Ukraine against Russian aggression. Much as we abhor the suffering of Ukrainians, most especially children, however, a free Ukraine is not necessary for the defense of the United States.

The goal of American foreign policy is the peace and tranquility of the American people. It is, after all, the purpose for which our government is constituted. Our social compact is with each other as Americans. We do what is good for us and for our children.

We do this not out of selfishness, but out of the common sense that it is in man’s nature to defend one’s own, beginning with himself, his family, his community, and his country. Americans have demonstrated an admirable quality of fighting elsewhere on this planet for other people at other times. But even then, we were demonstrating a principle of American grand strategy that has served this country throughout its history: we want to fight wars somewhere else than in America.

Americans Fight Elsewhere So We Don’t Fight Here

The idea of fighting wars in other countries—France, Germany, Belgium, the island chain that led to the conquest of Imperial Japan, Korea, Vietnam, even Iraq and Afghanistan—meant we were not waiting until war came to the cities of the United States. We would rather fight on someone else’s territory in the simple belief that our homes would, at least for the time being, be safe from the ravages of war.

Also, fighting on or near the enemy’s territory meant we would have to be defeated and displaced from that position before war could be made on the United States directly. This is the kind of strategy that puts the well-being of the American people first. It has also, in the process, defended the West and liberated millions of human beings. But that was not our purpose. Our purpose was our own defense.

To be clear, Russia today does not have armed forces that are sufficient to invade and wage a successful war in the United States. Witness their current progress in Ukraine.

What Russia does possess is a nuclear arsenal that is capable of destroying the land-based nuclear forces of the United States, American cities and their populations, and American military bases abroad that do play a strategic role in the defense of the United States. They also possess advanced ballistic missile defense systems to protect Moscow and strategic positions throughout Russia.

The Russian S-400 and S-500 air and missile defense systems can deploy nuclear-tipped interceptors to ensure that the Russian homeland is defended from American ballistic missiles. What about America?

The U.S. Is Unprotected Against Russia and China

For all of our tough talk about America’s military might, the United States does not possess a missile defense capable of stopping Russian or Chinese ballistic missiles. We are also not able to stop a ship-launched ballistic missile should the Iranians or any other nation choose to serve as a surrogate for such an attack.

Although President Reagan proposed a missile defense 40 years ago, a comprehensive, multilayered missile defense system from land, sea, air, and space has never been completed. Not coincidentally, the Democratic Party has opposed building such a defense throughout this period, never more so than by Joe Biden as senator, vice president, and now as president.

Biden’s predecessor, Barack Obama, famously told Russian President Medvedev in 2012 to tell Putin not to worry about American missile defense, because Obama would have more “flexibility” after the election. This was Obama’s way of saying that he could not publicly come out against missile defense during a campaign year, but not to worry since he was not going to build one against the Russian arsenal anyway.

Russia Knows We Can’t Protect Ourselves

America’s Democratic elites, especially those in the White House today, have intentionally left us vulnerable to nuclear attack in the belief that war, especially nuclear war, was not possible. This was underscored by White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki announcing to the world that “a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.”

But the Russians believe quite the opposite. They believe that war is man’s permanent condition and that nuclear weapons are merely one more aspect of war that must be mastered. The mere fact that they possess the largest nuclear arsenal in the world, are modernizing it with hypersonic reentry vehicles, and have built a missile defense to protect the Russian people, is evidence of this.

It is therefore not surprising that Russia does not take threats from the United States seriously. They know both that we do not possess a national missile defense and therefore won’t escalate hostilities beyond a certain point, and even if we did—out of a gross strategic miscalculation—we are ill-prepared to fight and win such an exchange. However sound Theodore Roosevelt’s admonition to “speak softly and carry a big stick” may have been through most of our history, speaking softly and carrying a big shield—as in ballistic missile defense—is a sounder corollary in the nuclear age.

Using Russia to Avoid Talking about China

Moreover, we have witnessed the political theatre of the U.S. intelligence agencies and the Democratic Party’s use of Russia as the prime threat to American freedom. However dangerous Russia may be, Communist China is the real threat to America. It has a population literally ten times that of Russia, a modern and advanced military, nuclear weapons, and an industrial capacity and GDP that is 7.5 times larger than Russia’s. No serious person thought the constant vilification of Russia was done for anything other than domestic political advantage in the left’s war against Donald Trump.

In retrospect, the focus on Russia looks more like a way for the U.S. Congress, controlled by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Sens. Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell, to avoid addressing Communist China and their theft of American intellectual property, and its commercial expansion throughout the world through its Belt and Road Initiative. This does not even include the declaration by the Communist Chinese on May 13, 2019, of a People’s War against the United States.

That declaration was in response to the Trump administration’s demands to negotiate better trade deals. Within six months of that declaration, the Covid-19 virus was spreading from Wuhan, causing the loss of nearly 1 million American lives, wreaking havoc on the U.S. economy, and creating the conditions whereby a U.S. presidential election could be stolen. In the face of all this, nothing has been done to hold the Chinese Communist Party to account.

Weakness Provokes Aggression and Contempt

Russian intelligence may well have believed that a nation that was not going to hold Communist China responsible for its malfeasance was going to find some way to dance out of whatever political and economic fallout may occur over a Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Russians watched while Biden as Obama’s vice president had seen Ukraine as a country to exploit. Witness his son Hunter Biden’s business dealings. Also, given Biden’s long-time opposition to national missile defense, the Russians no doubt see Biden as someone who will not run the risk of nuclear conflict.

This kind of weakness is provocative and dangerous in the extreme. It is also incredibly cruel given that the United States under the Biden administration has consistently given tacit support for Ukraine to become part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This has given Putin domestic political cover to invade and has given the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people the impression that they would be defended.

Finally, given the sorry fact that our government has left the American people vulnerable to ballistic missile attack, it would be irresponsible not to recommend that citizens and states immediately build preparedness. This means Americans should be preparing now for how best to provide for themselves and their families, for states to make sure they can maintain civil order, and for the federal authorities that are still loyal to the Constitution to make sure that our electric grid and strategic infrastructure are defended. This should be done in any case, for the simple reason that our national survival requires it.

Our enemies see weakness everywhere in Washington. It would be good to demonstrate to them the resolve of the American people, and to do so immediately.

How Twitter Fueled David French's Destruction Of His Own Character,"Incentives matter. We all know this, but it’s curious how little serious discourse there is about what those incentives are encouraging us to do.

We seem fine ignoring the fact that the incentive structure of Instagram trains young women to sexualize themselves for “likes” from strangers. Often it’s effectively training wheels for OnlyFans, and many parents let tweens use it largely without question or oversight.

Twitter reduces empathy, understanding, and nuance, while turbocharging the rewards for conflict and extremism. The obvious danger is being simply accepted with a shrug.

Each of these incentives, if aligned, can merge into an overwhelming force that pulls some or even most of us down a path that we didn’t expect and perhaps should even avoid. The effect of destructive incentives dragging someone into bad behavior can be found in the increasingly unseemly (and most likely unwitting) behavior of a once-respected writer and man: David French.

French is a lawyer who previously ran the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), a campus free speech advocacy and litigation group, and served as a military lawyer in Iraq. Not long ago, he was a middle-tier Never Trump writer for National Review. But he’s managed to elevate himself to much higher visibility by becoming perhaps the most extreme conservative critic of conservative evangelicals who supported Donald Trump.

After an online feud triggered by Sohrab Ahmari’s “Against David French-ism” piece in First Things, French ended up getting caught in a flywheel in which more extreme rhetoric gets him more attention, which then draws more attacks, which leads him in turn to even more extreme rhetoric.

Going After White Evangelical Trump Supporters

Today, that flywheel has taken him to the point where he attacks other people’s character in the strongest possible terms, using words like “cruel,” “vicious,” “deceitful,” and “indefensible.” A white evangelical himself, he recently claimed that America has “become more just” as “white Protestant power has waned.”

He describes evangelical Trump supporters the way he might once have talked about Islamic terrorists abroad, as potential national security threats. He says, “The hardcore Trump evangelical base threatens our constitutional rule of law.” He tweets, “The evidence that January 6th was a Christian insurrection just grows and grows and grows. Combatting this perversion of the Gospel has to be a top priority. It’s not just heresy, it’s an active threat to the peace and security of the nation.”

It’s not clear where he goes from here, but French has certainly profited from this so far. His name is now on many people’s lips. He drives a lot of online conversation. And he’s been rewarded with a recent elevation from purely conservative media to the Atlantic.

It’s unlikely French sat down one day and decided to reinvent himself into one of the most hysterically hostile critics of American evangelicals, or that he concocted an explicit strategy of using extreme rhetoric to boost his profile. But that’s where the perverse incentives of our society carried him.

Mobilizing Victimhood

Even more disturbing, with victim status as a prime currency in today’s society, French has also gone down the dark path of vicarious victimhood. Owing to French’s public status, one of his family members has been a target for horrific online abuse.

After these attacks started, rather than take steps to protect this person, French repeatedly posted information about him or her over multiple years, including this person’s full name (including middle name), relationship to him, even a picture and other personal info, and the specific characteristics that draw the abuse in the first place.

The attacks on this family member have allowed French to play the victim and parlay that into hard-for-conservatives-to-get mainstream press appearances. It got him on NPR’s “Fresh Air with Terry Gross.” It helped him get a major feature article in the Atlantic.

In these media appearances, French once again repeated all the identifying details of this family member that would draw still more abuse. In fact, it was in the Atlantic article that he even posted this family member’s full name, including middle name.

Social media is by its nature somewhat ephemeral. Even if the vile tweets about French’s family member somehow survived getting deleted for violating hate speech rules, they would have quickly been buried deep in the archives. But articles in major publications are something else entirely.

French’s major media writings and interviews are now permanent memorials for this family member to find later, rendering these vicious attacks indelible in a way social media never could. Imagine what this family member will find when googling his or her own name. Consider this: would anyone outside the dark corners of the internet have ever known about these tweets without French bringing them up himself?

I have no reason to believe French doesn’t love this family member. But the very nature of our sick society’s incentives turned French into that person’s victimizer, something he has probably never stepped back from the fray long enough to recognize.

Down the Dark Rabbit Hole

Too many people have already badly harmed themselves or their loved ones by getting sucked into the vortex by our society’s sick incentives. While none of us can completely escape their effects, let us be careful lest they take us to a place we never imagined ourselves going.

As for French, I hope he’s able to detach himself from the flywheel he’s stuck in. I hear privately from people who admire him and basically agree with his position on Trump that he’s now going too far. If he keeps going, he may well self-destruct.

Above all, David, if you’re reading this, please stop talking and writing about your family member, and tell your friends like David Brooks to stop writing about this person as well. Hate and vilify me as much as you want, but please think about what you’ve been doing to someone you love so much and take a step back from the brink.

Descent into evil is a permanent threat to everyone in a fallen world. Even the best struggle to maintain virtue and avoid temptations and the perverse incentives of modern society. And today’s social and professional incentives can push us all, not just French, in this direction if we aren’t careful.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/21/how-twitter-contributed-to-david-frenchs-destruction-of-his-own-character/,2022-03-21
Attacks On Clarence Thomas Fit Decades-Long Smear Campaign,"While claiming its aggressive collection of confidential information on private citizens is “narrowly tailored” and without a nefarious purpose, Democrats on the Jan. 6 Committee selectively leaked communications of a private citizen to smear political opponents.

Last week, CNN and the Washington Post published text messages between Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’s wife, Virginia, who goes by “Ginni,” and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows exchanged in the days leading up to and on the day of the Capitol riot.

“Help This Great President stand firm, Mark!!!” Ginni reportedly urged Meadows days after the 2020 contest when news organizations began to call the race for former Vice President Joe Biden. “You are the leader, with him, who is standing for America’s constitutional governance at the precipice. The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History.”

Out of the 29 of more than 2,300 text messages released from Meadows’ vast trove of data handed to the Select Committee, not one, the Washington Post conceded, included a direct reference to the sitting justice as the weaponized probe sought to dox a private citizen for petitioning her government.

“The messages, which do not directly reference Justice Thomas or the Supreme Court, show for the first time how Ginni Thomas used her access to Trump’s inner circle to promote and seek to guide the president’s strategy to overturn the election results,” the Post reported with the paper adopting Pelosi committee’s framing to indict private political views as a blockbuster scandal.

While the committee has made an open point to prosecute those who publicly sought to cast doubt on the fairness of the 2020 election results, the committee’s targeting of Ginni Thomas for privately petitioning government officials on her own marks further escalation of the probe’s assault on civil liberties, and makes Thomas case all the more unique.

CNN reported Monday the committee will now seek an interview with Ginni, who has become the latest to be dragged before lawmakers for exercising dissident views, even in private. But the probe’s latest request is just as much targeted at Ginni, a long-time conservative activist who has never concealed her activism, as it is her husband.

The left’s racist disdain for Justice Thomas has never been a well-kept secret by a virulent left frustrated by the mere existence of a black conservative, let alone one on the high bench. Attacks on Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s record on lenient sentencing for child sex crimes are cruel and racist. Baseless criticism of Justice Thomas is warranted, however, for his political heresy, starting with his own confirmation process three decades ago.

Publication of the text messages provoked immediate calls for Justice Thomas to recuse himself from any cases related to the Jan. 6 investigation for the crime of his wife’s public political views raising concerns over an election with record mail-in voting and last-minute rule changes. New York Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez even demanded Justice Thomas resign or face impeachment.

As outlined Tuesday in The Federalist by former Thomas Law Clerk Wendy Long, however, judges are never asked to recuse themselves over political views, whether their own or their spouse’s.

“Leftists in Congress and the media hyperventilate over every tidbit showing that Justice Thomas’s wife, Ginni, is involved in national conservative politics – most recently, that she pushed for integrity in the 2020 election,” Long wrote. “This isn’t news, and it has nothing to do with Justice Thomas’s ability to be a fair and impartial jurist.”

Instead, Long explained judicial recusal is about “mainly financial, legal, personal, or professional interests of the Justice or a family member.” Not personal politics. The strategy of the modern left, however, has been to intimidate the courts into submission to extremist and anti-Constitution politics. Consider the last three nomination battles: Justice Brett Kavanaugh was slandered as a serial gang rapist, Amy Coney Barrett was depicted as a character in The Handmaid’s Tale, and Stephen Breyer was pressured to retire while Democrats were in power to replace him.

Not only are the attacks on Thomas purely political, they’re hypocritical. Will Democrats calling on Justice Thomas to refrain from his official duties as a jurist similarly demand a probe into House Speaker Nancy Pelosi leveraging her position in Congress to rake in millions? Will journalists married to people in power recuse themselves from coverage on any issues their spouses conduct even minor work on? Probably not. It’s all theater.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/30/the-attacks-on-clarence-and-ginni-thomas-are-merely-latest-in-a-decades-long-smear-campaign/,2022-03-30
Trump Was Impeached For 'Inciting A Riot.' Now J6 Claims It Was Planned,"In a rare moment of focus on the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot, the House Select Committee recently took a break from prosecuting political dissidents to claim the violent protest was premeditated. Yet House Democrats impeached Donald Trump on Jan. 13, 2021 on the basis of claiming that riot was spontaneously triggered by the president’s speech at the White House that day despite the first violent action occurring before Trump finished speaking.

“The president of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack,” GOP Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney said in a statement announcing her intent to impeach. “Everything that followed was his doing.”

The committee Cheney now serves on as vice chair, however, has embraced a new theory with claims the Capitol assault was a pre-planned attack by far-right extremists.

“The House select committee investigating January 6 appears to believe the Capitol attack included a coordinated assault perpetrated by the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys militia groups that sought to physically stop the certification of Joe Biden’s election victory,” The Guardian reported Friday. “The panel’s working theory – which has not been previously reported though the Justice Department has indicted some militia group leaders – crystallized this week after obtaining evidence of the coordination in testimony and non-public video, according to two sources familiar with the matter.”

In August, the FBI threw cold water on the idea of an “organized plot” staged by far-right groups to storm the Capitol when it briefed the nine-member panel on the agency’s findings. What evidence the Jan. 6 Committee may use conclude otherwise, however, remains under seal as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s deputies have blocked shared access with minority lawmakers. The FBI has simultaneously stonewalled GOP requests to circumvent the speaker’s embargo on relevant information to Republicans. Both of these actions may make the committee legally suspect.

Last summer, Pelosi took the self-described “unprecedented” step of barring Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s appointments on the Select Committee for the first time in congressional history. Indiana Rep. Jim Banks, who was appointed to serve as ranking member, has spearheaded Republicans’ separate investigation into the Capitol security failures instead, centered on Pelosi’s culpable negligence in the run up to Jan. 6. The Jan. 6 Select Committee has explicitly pledged to avoid probing Pelosi’s conduct despite testimony from former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund that the speaker rejected National Guard requests to help six times.

The notion of a coordinated assault on the Capitol undermines Democrats’ claim that Trump and White House staff were solely responsible for the outburst that ensued on congressional grounds.

Then-President Trump, the story went, corralled his supporters in Washington, inflamed that mob, and ordered them to overthrow Congress in an attempted coup. Except the attack started two miles away before Trump’s address was finished, and in his speech the president was explicit in his request that attendees protest “peacefully.”

Meanwhile the FBI is still reportedly investigating a pair of pipe bombs planted at both the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committe headquarters and found the morning of Jan. 6, lending credence to the committee’s claims of coordinated violence in contradiction to the agency’s findings leaked to the press last summer. Many who showed up to Washington D.C. that day came armed, no matter what Trump said from the White House ellipse.

The Jan. 6 Committee’s narrative switching ahead of show trial hearings in prime time comes after its conspiracy of a Trump-concocted plan to disband Congress has failed to garner traction among an electorate more worried about gas prices and inflation than a two-hour riot more than a year ago. Democrats on the Jan. 6 Committee admitted last month the probe is all about the midterms, and they are openly executing a “digital Watergate” with demands for private records to harass and demean their political opponents.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/04/09/trump-haters-impeached-him-for-inciting-a-riot-now-theyre-claiming-the-riot-was-premeditated/,2022-04-09
Ukrainian Attack On Russian Cruiser Is Largest Warship Sunk Since WWII,"The flagship of the Russian Black Sea fleet, the missile cruiser Moskva, sunk on Thursday after large explosions shook the ship following what the Ukrainians claim was a missile attack on Wednesday. The Russians say the cause of the fire onboard the evacuated warship is under investigation.

According to The Daily Mail, the Ukrainians used several Turkish-built Bayraktar drones to distract the Moskva’s air defense systems before striking the ship with two domestically-built Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles. If true, this displays a high degree of battlefield coordination that the Ukrainians have used to largely thwart the invasion launched by their much larger neighbor.

For the Ukrainians, the strike on the Moskva would represent a helping of revenge. The ship was the lead warship in Russia’s opening moves on Snake Island in the Black Sea, an action featured on a new Ukrainian postage stamp.

From a practical perspective, the loss of the Moskva is significant, not only because it served as the Russian flagship, coordinating the Black Sea fleet, but also because the ship’s significant anti-air and anti-missile capabilities provided an air defense umbrella for the smaller ships around it. Consequently, the Russian amphibious threat to Odessa has virtually been eliminated, allowing Ukraine to redeploy forces assigned to the defense of that key port city to the battle to retake Kherson, about 90 miles to the east along the Black Sea coast.

The big enemy of warships through the centuries has been fire. Until the age of steel, fire could burn a ship down to the waterline. With the advent of gunpowder, the additional danger of explosives onboard made fire even a greater threat.

With the age of iron and steel, ship designers did what they could to protect vital parts of the ship, such as the engine room, command and control areas, and fuel and ammunition storage bunkers. But as missiles replaced guns, naval architecture went the other direction, largely discarding armor protection in favor of offensive punch and active defensive systems, such as radar-confusing chaff, electronic countermeasures, and anti-missile systems — both surface-to-air missiles and close-in weapon systems (CIWS).

Moskva had plenty of the latter but for some reason (training or maintenance issues with the targeting chain — radar to crew to weapon system) they proved ineffective against what should have been an easy task: shooting down large, sub-sonic cruise missiles.

As a result, a missile with a relatively small 330-lb. warhead can knock a 12,490-ton ship out of commission when that warhead ignites the large amounts of missile propellant and explosives on the target ship — it’s the secondary explosion that’s the bigger problem. Much like all those photos we’ve seen of Russian tanks with their turrets blown off and flung many yards away, when the small antitank missile warhead penetrates the turret and detonates the tank gun rounds stored onboard.

The loss of a flagship during war can be devasting to a navy’s pride as well as national morale. This is further complicated by the fact that the ship was named for Russia’s capital.

This threat so vexed Adolf Hitler during World War II that he ordered the renaming of the heavy cruiser KMS Deutschland to Lützow in early 1940, recognizing that the loss of a warship named for the nation itself would be a devastating propaganda victory. This cautionary move was validated when, only three months later, a sister ship of the newly renamed Lützow, the KMS Blücher, was sunk by gunfire and torpedoes from Norwegian coastal defense batteries on April 9, 1940.

Blücher was the flagship of the German operation. Lützow was also damaged and forced to withdraw in the same battle. The loss of these German ships in the battle delayed Germany’s Norway conquest timetable, allowing the Norwegian royal family to escape and lead a government in exile. Blücher’s displacement was 18,500-tons, about half again as large as Moskva.

Some 42 years after the sinking of Blücher, a nuclear-powered Royal Navy attack submarine hit the Argentinian cruiser ARA General Belgrano with two torpedoes May 2, 1982, during the Falklands War. The General Belgrano, formerly, the USS Phoenix, a U.S. Navy light cruiser, sank with the loss of 323 of the ship’s 1,100 crew members. General Belgrano displaced 12,242-tons when loaded for battle, slightly smaller than Moskva.

Thus, the Ukrainian attack on Moskva, coming almost 40 years later, represents the largest warship sunk during wartime by hostile action since WWII — and much like the Norwegian sinking of Blücher, by a nation with effectively no navy.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/04/15/ukrainian-attack-on-russian-missile-cruiser-is-the-largest-warship-sunk-since-wwii/,2022-04-15
"Why Won't Biden Condemn Attacks On Churches, Justices' Homes?","Shortly after Politico published the U.S. Supreme Court’s leaked Dobbs v. Jackson opinion draft last Monday, leftists took to the streets to express their outrage that SCOTUS plans to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Since the first night when pro-abortion supporters picketed in front of the barricades protecting the Supreme Court, radical pro-abortion groups, some with communist undertones, sicced their supporters on conservative justices with hopes of intimidating them into changing their minds. They shared the justices’ alleged home addresses and even bribed people to participate with stipends.

Other groups focused on targeting pro-life religious institutions. Catholic churches and pregnancy centers were vandalized with pro-abortion graffiti.

While he was quick to threaten to reject the court’s “continued attack on abortion and reproductive rights,” the “deeply Catholic” President Joe Biden has yet to personally and publicly denounce the political violence perpetrated by his supporters.

In addition to refusing to condemn the SCOTUS leak or investigate it as a crime, the Biden administration did not even acknowledge the attacks until Fox News’s Peter Doocy demanded comment from White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki last week.

“Do you think that progressive activists that are now planning protests outside some of the justices’ houses are extreme?” he asked during a White House press briefing.

“Peaceful protest? No, peaceful protest is not extreme,” Psaki replied.

The pair volleyed back and forth about the dangers associated with organized intimidation of SCOTUS justices before Psaki admitted that “The president’s view is that there’s a lot of passion, a lot of fear, a lot of sadness from many, many people across this country about what they saw in that leaked document.”

“We obviously want people’s privacy to be respected. We want people to protest peacefully if they want to protest. That is certainly what the president’s view would be,” she said. “But I think we shouldn’t lose the point here. The reason people are protesting is because women across the country are worried about their fundamental rights that had been law for 50 years — their rights to make choices about their own bodies and their own health care — are at risk. That’s why people are protesting. They’re unhappy. They’re scared.”

Days after the violence and destruction, however, Psaki reversed course and issued a statement condemning “violence, threats, or vandalism” on Twitter.

“.@POTUS strongly believes in the Constitutional right to protest. But that should never include violence, threats, or vandalism. Judges perform an incredibly important function in our society, and they must be able to do their jobs without concern for their personal safety,” she wrote.

Despite increasing calls for the president to denounce the violence, Biden has yet to personally call for peace.

Democrats tried to impeach former President Donald Trump for “inciting a riot” on Jan. 6, 2021. They accused him of egging on his supporters even though he called for peace in a video that was quickly censored by Big Tech.

When it comes to Biden and the leftists-endorsed violence over the Dobbs decision, however, many of those same Democrats refuse to hold the president accountable and have joined in the battle cries for destruction themselves.

Congrats To The Media For Finally Finding A White Supremacist,"Assuming the gunman who shot up the Buffalo, New York, grocery store really was motivated by anti-black racism, let’s do what the media do when faced with an Islamic terrorist who goes on a killing spree in America and just refer to him as a “lone wolf,” a mentally unstable individual who in no way reflects any broader phenomenon or trend.

Except, unlike with violent Muslim extremism, that characterization in this case would be true.

Despite what the media, Democrats, leftists, and, of course, the permanent Washington bureaucracy say (over, and over, and over again), there is no imminent, large-scale threat from white nationalists. It doesn’t exist outside of Joe Biden’s TelePrompter.

To that claim, leftists would surely point to news reports and declarations by the U.S. Justice Department and Homeland Security. The New York Times has been all over it.

“Top law enforcement officials say the biggest domestic terror threat comes from white supremacists.”— New York Times, June 15, 2021

“Homeland Security Dept. Affirms Threat of White Supremacy After Years of Prodding.”—New York Times, Oct. 1, 2019

“The Grave Threats of White Supremacy and Far-Right Extremism.”—New York Times, Feb. 22, 2019

Even under Donald Trump—especially under Donald Trump—the permanent bureaucracy had been hyperventilating about “white supremacy” and the existential threat it supposedly represented to every American, and even democracy itself.

Strangely enough, though, there isn’t a ton of publicly available government data on the topic. More often than not, a government agency or official makes an assertion about white supremacists on a rampage and we’re just supposed to take it as fact without hearing any specifics.

For a threat so pervasive, prolific, and prominent, wouldn’t you expect there to be a nearly unlimited body of work readily available for the public to consume and understand just how grave it is?

It’s not there. You’re supposed to believe it anyway.

Sorry, government, but would you mind showing me your work on this thing you’re telling me is imminently deadly?

Shut your racist mouth!

In the final months of Trump’s term, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf released a report titled “Homeland Threat Assessment.” In that report, Wolf said he was “particularly concerned about white supremacist violent extremists who have been exceptionally lethal in their abhorrent, targeted attacks in recent years.”

The report said that domestic violent extremists, “specifically white supremacist extremists (WSEs)” were and would continue to be “the most persistent and lethal threat in the Homeland.” It made all kinds of claims about “WSEs”: that they have “demonstrated longstanding intent to target racial and religious minorities, members of the LGBTQ+ community, politicians, and those they believe promote multi-culturalism and globalization”; and “have conducted more lethal attacks in the United States than any other DVE (domestic violent extremist) movement”; and “have engaged in outreach and networking opportunities abroad.”

There was even a tally alleging that nearly 40 people had been killed in attacks perpetrated by “WSEs” from 2018 and 2019. “WSEs conducted half of all lethal attacks (8 of 16), resulting in the majority of deaths (39 of 48),” the report said.

But there was a problem with the report. There were precisely zero citations showing where the Department of Homeland Security had derived its conclusions—no news articles or academic papers. Just an assurance by the acting secretary, who was “particularly concerned about white supremacist violent extremists” of late.

Hmm — might there be information elsewhere? A document published the previous year by the same department said the agency looked at the years from 2000 to mid-2016 and counted “28 attacks in the United States committed by WSEs, which collectively resulted in 51 fatalities.”

That factoid came with a citation, so that’s good. But this was the corresponding footnote: “Based on a review of US Government information, law enforcement reporting, and open source.” There was no link to specific incidents or verifiable data. There was no cross reference. That wouldn’t fly in a high school English paper, but the feds apparently think they’re above having to back up their wild claims with any actual evidence.

There’s more publicly available information about the government spending millions of dollars to investigate the prevalence of obesity in lesbians than there is about an allegedly serious and fatal threat we’re facing from white supremacists.

What about at the state level? In 2019, Democrat New Jersey Gov. Philip Murphy’s administration published a report on individual episodes of “domestic terrorism” that purportedly took place across the nation throughout the previous year. To the department’s credit, it was highly transparent about what it was counting as an incident of “terrorism,” including names, dates, and locations of the perpetrators.

There were, the report said, a total of 32 “domestic terrorist attacks, disrupted plots, threats of violence, and weapons stockpiling by individuals with a radical political or social agenda.” Of that 32, the office said the overwhelming majority, 25, were carried out by white supremacists.

The report listed each individual incident of white supremacist-linked terrorism, with the name of the perpetrator, his age, and the location of the incident, but without references to where it drew the data. Additional information requires looking up each episode on your own.

One of the incidents involved Benjamin Morro, a 28-year-old Wisconsin man who accidentally killed himself by mishandling explosives in his apartment. No motive has ever been established as to why Morro had the combustible items but law enforcement claimed to have found “white supremacist material,” i.e., literature in pamphlets or books, in his home.

Is a dummy who accidentally blows himself up what comes to mind when you hear the phrase “white supremacist terrorist attack”?

Another one involved Ronnie Wilson, a 32-year-old Tennessee man who was charged with shooting a cop during a traffic stop. Wilson was allegedly a member of the white supremacist gang Aryan Nations, but the officer he shot was also white.

When a white man shoots another white man, is that what comes to mind when you hear the phrase “white supremacist terrorist attack”?

One other incident involved a homeless man who was yelling racial epithets in public. (To which I ask, has anyone seen or heard from Chris Matthews lately?)

Yet another pertained to a black man who was burned alive by his white housemate. The two of them lived at Frazier Young Supportive Living, a residence in Tennessee for the mentally impaired.

A homeless man and a literal mental patient. Is that what comes to mind when you hear the phrase “white supremacist terrorist attacks”?

If those four incidents don’t fill you with fear that white supremacists lurk in the shadows to commit random acts of violence, I don’t know what to tell you. You should be deathly afraid!

To be sure, not all of the entries in the New Jersey government’s report are a reach. A few appear to be legitimate, racially motivated attacks on ethnic minorities.

One involved Natasha Bowers, a 33-year-old woman who, along with five other skinheads, beat up a black man in the back of a bar in Pennsylvania. But the odd thing about that solitary episode is that it was counted by the report as six separate attacks, one for each of the attackers charged by police.

The authors of the report did the same thing with the assault of a black man at a bar in Washington state. Eight attackers identified by law enforcement were believed to be affiliated with the Aryan Brotherhood. Each suspect was listed in the report as an individual “white supremacist attack,” even though there was only one incident.

This would be like saying we had 19 separate September 11s because that’s the number of hijackers who participated. No, we had just the one carried out by multiple people. That more than one attacker was involved doesn’t mean we count each one as an individual event.

To recap: of the 25 attacks labeled in the New Jersey government’s report as white supremacy, 14 were related to only two separate incidents. One of them involved a man who accidentally killed himself, another was perpetrated by a homeless guy, and yet another was committed by a mental patient in a home for the intellectually disabled. That brings the total attacks in 2018 down to more like eight—across our entire nation of 330 million people.

Fewer than ten “white supremacy” attacks doesn’t exactly sound like something the FBI should be busying itself with. The numbers on “white supremacy” couldn’t have been more padded if they were on their period.

Yet the president is scheduled to visit Buffalo this week, where he will most certainly talk up white supremacy as an all-consuming force that can only be beaten back by voting for more Democrats.

Disney Relies On Cries Of Racism To Boost 'Obi-Wan Kenobi' Series,"This should have been Disney’s time in the sun, basking in the rays from happy fans. The House of Mouse just released its biggest Star Wars project in years, “Obi-Wan Kenobi,” a show featuring its most popular Star Wars characters, only to have it land with a thud.

Most companies would analyze what went wrong and try to fix it, but not Disney. Instead of trying to understand fans’ distaste, Disney took the nuclear option and blasted their viewers as racists.

Disney Implies Its Own Fans Are Racists

Obi-Wan Kenobi is the latest expensive and disappointing entry in Disney’s cavalcade of streaming content. The story follows Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi as he suffers a midlife crisis while trying to save a tween-age Princess Leia from the Empire. At best, it’s OK. At worst, it’s painful.

The selling point of a show like this is to bring back beloved characters from the admired Star Wars prequels. You would think traditional positive marketing and welcoming back those lifelong fans would be the smart play, but that’s not what Disney’s marketing department had in mind.

Just three days before the May 27 premiere, The Independent released an interview with actress Moses Ingram, who plays the tone-deaf antagonist Reva, telling interviewers Disney warned her to be ready for racist attacks from fans. She also said Director Deborah Chow went to lengths to put “proper systems in place” to protect the crew from feared fan racism. From the beginning to Disney, they were making clear that the real enemies weren’t the inquisitors but the fans.

Then just as the first reviews were coming in, Disney issued viral posts on Instagram and Twitter. “We are proud to welcome Moses Ingram to the Star Wars family and excited for Reva’s story to unfold. If anyone intends to make her feel in any way unwelcome, we have only one thing to say: we resist,” Disney wrote on their official social media.

You’d think that would be enough, but Disney isn’t anything if persistent in advertising. The Mouse then grabbed Obi-Wan Kenobi himself, Ewen McGregor, in what looks like a hostage video, saying: “if you’re sending her bullying messages, you’re no Star Wars fan in my mind.”

Star Wars Fans Are the Problem

At no point during this or later parts of this debacle, did credible evidence surface of a racist attack on Ingram, neither from Disney nor the media. Nevertheless, that didn’t stop them from going on the hunt for their favorite targets: the nerds.

As if the Mouse had waved his magic wand, every mainstream and lefty outlet joined forces to attack the fandom. At first, the attacks either were unskeptical reports of the Ingram story, attacks using clips and quotes from celebrities like Trevor Noah, or claims of review bombing; meaning fake reviews put up by bots or trolls. However, this pretext quickly devolved as journos felt they had been given permission to bully.

A headline from NPR reads, “Racist ‘Star Wars fans aren’t new. Why doesn’t Disney do more to protect its actors?” The Week went with the trite “The Star Wars fandom’s racism problem.” Other outlets, usually more left-wing, like Mother Jones, skipped the on-ramp entirely. “Why Can’t the Star Wars Nerds Imagine a World With Black People?”

Everyone from local news outlets to national papers like The Guardian, to popular magazines like Wired, to blogspam like Screen Rant, to more hoity-toity fare like Fast Company, and everything else in between got in on the orgy of media violence. Leading to my personal favorite, from Mel Magazine“There’s No Bigger Loser Than A Racist ‘Star Wars’ Fan.”

In response to this media bombardment, the Babylon Bee pithily retorted: “’I Wish They Had Made This Black Character More Interesting,’ Says Star Wars Fan Who Is A Racist.”

Crying Wolf to Divert Fair Criticism

This isn’t the first time the media piled on Star Wars fans. After “The Last Jedi” debuted, a popular hate article topic circulated, created by Rian Johnson calling fans manbabies and blaming fans for bullying Kelly Marie Tran off social media. On Twitter, you find Last Jedi haters next to GamerGate for being partially responsible for everything from politics to mass shootings. What’s different now is the scale of the attack, and that it’s Disney leading the charge.

Consider that these attacks began before “Obi-Wan Kenobi” was even released. Disney knew it might have an expensive turd on its hands, and it needed some way to justify the rumored $25 million per episode budget. So, what do you do in this year of our Lord 2022? You go with woke anti-marketing, enlisting the media to save your show and protect it from any potential criticism both from reviewers and fans alike.

More frustrating is that this strategy might actually work, at least in the short term. Obi-Wan is getting talks of a second season, and while the audience score for the show on Rotten Tomatoes is middling around 59 percent, the review scores remain a high 87 percent. Disney knows if the media puts out 500 articles about a show, then the project is staying on top of the Google search results for a good long time.

But is Disney eating its own tail? Are they expecting new fans to appear after digesting their programs and forgetting about their newest streaming bore-fest? Can you tell me what happened in “Captain Falcon: Winter Soldier”? Because I know I can’t.

These shows are lackluster, boring, generic, and forgettable. As seen with Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s death blow to Me Too, people are sick of false prudish wokeness. People may defend woke Disney, but few like it. It isn’t Rey Skywalker that fans want to be, but Luke.

"FBI Casually Treats Alarming Attacks, Threats On Pro-Life Centers","Pro-life centers in nearly half of U.S. states have been attacked following a premature leak of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson, but the FBI’s plans to address threats of past or future violence, especially if the high court overturns Roe v. Wade, are not clear.

Ever since a leaked opinion surfaced, churches, crisis pregnancy centers, and billboards openly support protecting life in the womb have sustained vitriolic attacks, vandalism with pro-abortion mantras, and been burned to the ground by arsonists.

Even student activists advocating for saving preborn babies are suffering bullying and brutality from their classmates. One pro-life student in New Jersey sustained minor injuries after pro-abortion classmates physically attacked her for holding a sign calling for “Equal Rights For Babies in the Womb.”

This is where the FBI often comes in when the victims are favorable to the political left, but so far, the same agency that flocked to Talladega Superspeedway over hate crime allegations that a garage pull cord was a noose designed to target NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace and spied on a presidential candidate because Hillary Clinton said he colluded with Russians doesn’t seem to have the same urgency about life-forward centers that care and advocate for mothers and babies.

There are many open calls for violence against Supreme Court justices and anyone who believes unborn babies have a right to life. The Department of Homeland Security warned in a May memo of future threats that may come from a “broader ideological spectrum” than they previously notated.

To put it simply, DHS, the same agency that established a disinformation governance board headed by a Russia collusion hoaxer acknowledged that “grievances related to restricting abortion access could fuel violence by pro-choice abortion-related violent extremists and other [domestic violent extremists]” are finally on their radar.

Yet at the time DHS issued this memo, multiple pro-life centers had already been vandalized and harmed by what appeared to be pro-abortion activists. A mysterious anarchist-connected group called Jane’s Revenge took responsibility for some of these attacks, including one on the Wisconsin Family Action building. That burned after aggravators graffitied the walls with ominous messages and threw Molotov cocktails. They also threatened to continue “adopt increasingly extreme tactics to maintain freedom over our own bodies” and carry those out across the United States

The FBI field office in Milwaukee reportedly joined local law enforcement for an investigation into the Wisconsin bombardment but told The Federalist that the Madison Police Department “remains the lead agency for information and updates on the investigation.” When asked whether the FBI plans to investigate Jane’s Revenge, a spokeswoman told The Federalist that “As a matter of longstanding policy, the FBI does not comment upon the existence or the nonexistence of any investigation.”

Other pro-life centers that experienced damage from similar attacks involving lit Molotov cocktails including Oregon Right Life in Keizer, Oregon, however, did not appear to have the benefit of an investigation. The FBI field office in Oregon told The Federalist that “the FBI cannot confirm the existence of an investigation” into the break-in and fire that damaged the ORL building.

Not only have the feds overlooked some of these crimes but corporate media, which loves to highlight every time an abortion clinic feels threatened, has been relatively silent.

DHS claims that it, in partnership with the FBI, will “continue to share timely and actionable information and intelligence with the broadest audience possible,” but where is the information on this group that has threatened to strike again?

“While we have no comment on any specific incidents, the FBI remains vigilant and continues to work every day with our law enforcement partners to detect and disrupt any potential threats of violence in our communities,” the FBI told The Federalist in a statement. “As always, we remind members of the public that should they become aware of any suspicious activity to immediately contact law enforcement.”

Pro-life centers and churches openly fear more violence and destruction in wake of the imminent Dobbs v. Jackson ruling but their resources for protection and prevention are already limited by their own states.

Even though pregnancy centers, including one that was set on fire in Buffalo, are clearly at risk if the court decides to overturn Roe, Democrat-led states such as New York are focused on funneling $35 million in taxpayer funds to beef up security at abortion facilities instead.

That combined with the FBI and DHS’s vague plans to prevent attempts to browbeat pro-life organizations and people leaves organizations that advocate for life and take care of babies and mothers vulnerable.

"Media, Police Uninterested In Political Violence Against Pregnancy Centers","Over the weekend, a pregnancy resource center in Gresham, Oregon was set on fire after “an incendiary device was thrown through a window,” according to Luke Cirillo, CEO of the Gresham Pregnancy Resource Center.

“The kind of outrage that’s being directed at us is based on a complete misunderstanding and misrepresentation of who we are and how we have served the hundreds of thousands of people that have come to us over the decades,” Cirillo wrote.

This weekend, pro-abortion activists firebombed a pregnancy center in Gresham, OR, which provided material help for mothers & children.



Imagine if this had been an abortion clinic. It would be headlines news. But because it’s a pro-life center, media & the Biden admin ignore. pic.twitter.com/qfBbtitV2G — Lila Rose (@LilaGraceRose) June 13, 2022

On Mother’s Day, the Oregon Right to Life Office was set on fire with two Molotov cocktails. The same day, a pro-life group in Madison, Wisconsin was also targeted with a Molotov cocktail and vandalism reading, “If abortions aren’t safe then you aren’t either.” These are just a few of the 23 attacks carried out so far on pregnancy centers, churches, and pro-life groups since the draft of the Supreme Court Dobbs decision was leaked on May 2.

The likely motive behind these attacks is not a mystery. In fact, one pro-abortion terrorist group calling themselves “Jane’s Revenge” has taken credit for several of the attacks, including a fire at a Buffalo, New York pro-life medical office where arsonists left graffiti reading, “Jane Was Here.” “Jane” obviously refers to the pseudonym “Jane Roe” used as the plaintiff in Roe v. Wade.

Despite what appears to be a horrifying trend of domestic terrorism, our corrupt corporate media and corrupt law enforcement officials seem uninterested at best. At worst, they seem to have contempt for groups whose only crime is supporting and loving pregnant women.

What little coverage these stories are given is laughable, given what we know the coverage would look like if the same attacks were carried out on abortion providers. According to The Daily Beast, the story in Gresham was simply, “Authorities Investigate ‘Suspicious’ Fire at Pregnancy Resource Center.”

AP went with the matter of fact, “Police: New York anti-abortion center damaged by arson.” When a man was caught in an assassination attempt last week against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, one of the five justices expected to vote in favor of overturning Roe, the news didn’t even make the front page of The New York Times.

Law enforcement’s response has been arguably worse. Story after story reports that no arrests have been made, no suspects detained. The Amherst police investigating the Buffalo attack said in their news release that their investigation did not include a suspected motive. What kind of motive could possibly be behind graffiti reading “Jane Was Here”? Police can’t say.

Law enforcement’s response is even more appalling given U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland’s pledge to protect abortion clinics last fall.

“The department will provide support from federal law enforcement when an abortion clinic or reproductive health center is under attack,” Garland said, adding that he would “not tolerate violence against those seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health services.”

Will Garland make a similar pledge to protect and support pregnancy centers or pregnant women seeking services? When I asked the DOJ and the FBI this question and whether they would be investigating the recent attacks, the FBI National Press Office sent me a statement: “We have no comment on any specific incidents.”

Update: Three days after this article was published, and after over 40 attacks, the FBI sent an updated statement saying they would be investigating the incidents.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/06/14/corporate-media-law-enforcement-uninterested-in-political-violence-when-it-involves-pregnancy-centers/,2022-06-14
"44 Days After Dobbs Leak, FBI Says They Will Investigate Attacks On Pro-Life Groups","Image Credit Alexander Shur/Twitter

On May 2, Politico reported that a leaked draft of the Dobbs v. Jackson decision would return the issue of abortion to the state level. Forty-four days later, and after more than 40 pro-life individuals and organizations have faced incidents of violence, vandalism, and intimidation, the FBI said they will investigate the incidents.

“The FBI is investigating a series of attacks and threats targeting pregnancy resource centers and faith-based organizations across the country,” the FBI National Press Office told The Federalist in an updated statement on Thursday.

The original statement sent to The Federalist on Monday when asked about the spike in attacks on pro-lifers said, “We have no comment on any specific incidents.”

The statement comes after a number of congressional leaders and Senators sent letters to Attorney General Merrick Garland, demanding law enforcement agencies take action on the political violence. A new report from the pro-life group Susan B. Anthony List compiled 40 incidents of violence, vandalism, and interruption of worship that have occurred since the leak.

One pro-abortion group called “Jane’s Revenge” has claimed responsibility for several of the attacks, including Molotov cocktails thrown through windows and firebombing of pro-life organizations.

“We are deeply concerned that this trend will continue should the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade in the coming weeks unless the Department of Justice, the F.B.I., the U.S. Attorneys’ Office take a firm public stance and proactive response against these violent threats, ” a letter from 16 U.S. senators stated.

Last fall, when the Supreme Court declined to enter emergency relief against Texas’s “heartbeat” bill, the Justice Department immediately began looking for avenues to challenge the state’s law. Garland put out a statement not only pledging to “to challenge Texas SB8 in order to protect the constitutional rights of women and other persons,” but to “provide support from federal law enforcement when an abortion clinic or reproductive health center is under attack.”

Why The J6 Committee's Attacks On Ginni Thomas Harm Every American,"The left has expressed a special hatred for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas for decades. Thomas stands for everything our elites hate: free speech, due process, fair elections, and every individual right in the Constitution’s Bill of Rights. Paradoxically, the left seems to find this especially galling because he is the descendant of slaves.

But for all these decades, they haven’t been able to get him. Cue House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s show trial masquerading as an investigation of a three-hour protest at the Capitol on January 6, 2021. It was a protest that got out of hand when the Capitol Police took the most peculiar step of opening the Capitol doors wide to the protesters.

And who is the congressional committee’s scapegoat of choice for the J6 star chamber? Thomas’s wife, Ginni. Interestingly, PolitiFact concluded that there is no evidence Mrs. Thomas had anything to do with organizing the Jan. 6 protests. So the committee and its media cohorts have been on a propagandistic fishing expedition.

For example, they located some text messages with then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows in which Thomas expressed concerns about the 2020 electoral process. They dug up emails in which she asked Trump lawyer John Eastman to provide updates on what was going on with election litigation. And so on. They’ll keep trying to cobble together their desired picture. In the end, they’ll just make it all up (a specialty of Rep. Adam Schiff’s, D-Calif.)

So, since they haven’t been able to destroy Justice Thomas after years of trying, they hope to get to him through his wife. It’s a sickening tactic, one reflecting the worst of totalitarian regimes, including Joseph Stalin’s Russia and Mao Zedong’s China. But the tactic reveals an even deeper goal. They detest anyone who dares defend real freedom. And they can’t stand anyone who exercises that freedom.

So watch what they are doing to Ginni Thomas: their disrespect for her private life, their double standards of justice, their shameless smear campaigns. Observe their intent to destroy her husband through her. Watch it. Because it is what they have in mind for you and me and any American who values freedom and a private life.

We Are All Ginni Thomas Now

If you’ve ever heard Ginni Thomas speak (to the extent the media permits you to really hear her) you can immediately see she is the real deal. If you are a person of good will, you will see a kind-hearted person who strives for fairness and looks for goodness in everyone.

She obviously loves America. She values its constitutional guarantees of individual rights for everybody. There is absolutely no guile in her.

But in the eyes of this congressional witch hunt, Thomas’s devotion to the American concept of “liberty and justice for all” is the big crime. It’s a concept that leads to the idea of “one man, one vote” and free speech and real debate — all of which run counter to the Democrats’ self-professed goal of permanent one-party rule.

Everyone needs to understand that if Ginni Thomas has no right to express her opinions and have conversations about those opinions with family, friends, and acquaintances as a private citizen, then neither do you. If she has no right to ask obvious questions — in this case questions about election integrity, but it could be about anything else — then neither do you. Everything they are trying to pin on Thomas about her “activism” and possibly “influencing” her husband or trying to “overturn” the 2020 election is b-llsh-t.

Everybody has a right to question any election they want. Just as the Democrats in Congress put on non-stop show trials for four years in which they pushed the now-proven bald-faced lie that the 2016 election was “stolen,” every private citizen has the right to ask questions, especially about weird and unprecedented electoral procedures. Particularly in light of the elites’ Time magazine admission of how they rigged it, after all.

The Complete Trashing of the Bill of Rights

So if you really want to understand where the J6 “hearings” are going with their attack on Ginni Thomas, you should see it as a proxy attack on every American citizen. Just look at the scandalous treatment of non-violent J6 defendants who are handled like Soviet-era political prisoners by a now putrefied Department of Justice (DOJ), all with the apparent concurrence of congressional Democrats. Just look at the Stalinist-styled pre-dawn raids being conducted by the Federal Bureau of so-called Investigation. If Congress wasn’t so corrupt, we’d have an investigation into these heinous, un-American acts.

The Democrat-controlled Congress apparently has contempt for each and every right enumerated in the Bill of Rights. The policy positions they push are all about destroying your private life. Let’s check them off, one by one.

They routinely limit your First Amendment rights to freedom of thought, speech, writing, and association under the guise of non-discrimination. As the treatment of J6 protesters shows, you have no right to petition for an address of your grievances. The Second Amendment is now on their chopping block because they don’t want you to be able to defend your rights or the people you love.

The Democrats’ constant attacks on the right to private property — and giving license to mobs to harass officials at their homes — look like attacks on the Third Amendment. The FBI’s middle-of-the-night raids on the homes of citizens like Jeff Clark and James O’Keefe and Roger Stone spits in the face of the Fourth Amendment.

Democrats’ subpoena of Ginni Thomas is a ruse to try to invent testimony against her husband as well as against herself, in violation both of spousal privilege and of the Fifth Amendment. (Or, as Schiff seems to be aiming for: creating the impression of impropriety by publicly airing what spouses talk about in their private lives.)

The DOJ has clearly violated the Sixth Amendment by preventing J6 defendants from having a speedy trial. Many were detained and incarcerated without being charged. This brings us to the Seventh Amendment’s right to a trial by jury, presumably an impartial jury. It is laughable to presume that any jury pool in the exceedingly leftist District of Columbia would allow a fair trial to any Jan. 6 defendant.

If you follow Julie Kelly’s superb investigative reporting on the treatment of J6 defendants in the D.C. jail, you should be outraged that the cruel and unusual punishment of defendants — including solitary confinement for long periods, beatings, and the withholding of medical treatment for offenses like “parading” — are in direct violation of the Eighth Amendment.

No doubt congressional Democrats view the Ninth Amendment as a total joke since they don’t seem to believe Americans should have any individual rights at all. Finally, they hate the Tenth Amendment because it means that you might be able to escape their grasp by regaining your individual rights in a state like Florida governed by Ron DeSantis.

Parading a Private Citizen as a Scare Tactic

So much for the Bill of Rights. Attacking family members — and the private lives of perceived opponents — is behavior typical of all totalitarian systems. Ginni Thomas is simply the private citizen whom the committee hopes to parade as an example of what will happen to you (and your families) if you don’t conform and comply with their demands.

If you think you’ll be able to live unmolested by elitists who so routinely abuse their power, think again.

One of the committee’s key goals is to tamper with the Supreme Court. They want to eliminate a justice who has a non-negotiable respect for due process. But they also hope to make sure his wife, a private citizen, doesn’t speak to him without their express permission and surveillance. If they can do that to her, they’re on the road to doing it to every one of us.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/06/28/why-the-j6-committees-attacks-on-ginni-thomass-free-speech-are-a-totalitarian-attack-on-every-american/,2022-06-28
1A Group Goes After J6 Committee For 'McCarthy-esque' Defamation,"A lawyer for 1st Amendment Praetorian, a nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting free speech rights, is slamming the Jan. 6 Committee for its McCarthyite and anti-American tactics, in a letter obtained exclusively by The Federalist. Subpoenas shared exclusively with The Federalist confirm the congressional inquiry is McCarthyism on steroids.

To the public, the Jan. 6 Committee pushes false narratives premised on guilt-by-association, while behind the scenes the committee demands its targets abandon their constitutional rights. But now, 1st Amendment Praetorian is pushing back, with the group’s lawyer going public with the committee’s anti-American machinations.

On Thursday before the long Independence Day weekend, the New York Times reported that Democrat Rep. Jamie Raskin stated that when the Jan. 6 Committee reconvenes public hearings in July, “he intends to lead a presentation that will focus on the roles far-right groups like the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers and 1st Amendment Praetorian played in the Capitol attack.” According to the Times, “Mr. Raskin has also promised to explore the connections between those groups and the people in Mr. Trump’s orbit.”

“No matter what you think of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, 1st Amendment Praetorian in no way resembles those groups,” Leslie McAdoo Gordon, an attorney for 1st Amendment Praetorian, told The Federalist. 1st Amendment Praetorian provides pro bono security services at events to ensure a heckler’s veto does not interfere with the speakers’ constitutional right to express their viewpoint, McAdoo Gordon explained.

Court documents obtained by The Federalist provide more background on the organization, which Robert Lewis, a retired United States Army Green Beret and recipient of the Bronze Star and a Purple Heart, founded in 2020 as a Delaware nonprofit. In the legal filing, Lewis explained that he started the nonprofit “to ensure that every American can freely associate, freely gather and freely speak on matters of public concern to them without threat or fear of intimidation, retribution, bodily harm or death.”

However, for the last year, the Jan. 6 Committee and a complicit press have falsely portrayed 1st Amendment Praetorian, also known as 1AP, as right-wing, paramilitary, or even a militia, McAdoo Gordon said. “They are none of those things,” the lawyer told The Federalist.

She further stressed this point in her Thursday letter to the Jan. 6 Committee, noting that 1st Amendment Praetorian is not an “anti-government” group and “did not, would not, and will not advocate, condone, or excuse violence in the pursuit of political aims. Doing so contradicts its core mission and values.” The letter continued: “Any suggestion that Mr. Lewis or Mr. Luelsdorff would do so is categorically false and deeply offensive.”

Nor does the politics of the volunteers or speakers enter the equation, McAdoo Gordon added, saying: “1st Amendment Praetorian screens individuals interested in helping protect free speech, most of whom are former military or law enforcement officers, to confirm they are who they say they are, that they have been honorably discharged, and have no criminal record or other concerning background information.”

Raskin’s reported comments to the Times, however, indicate that the Jan. 6 Committee is poised to feed the country more false and misleading information, this time about 1st Amendment Praetorian. Raskin’s assertion that 1st Amendment Praetorian played any role in the Capitol attack is blatantly false, McAdoo Gordon said. “My clients had nothing to do with the Jan. 6 riot,” McAdoo Gordon told The Federalist, adding that their planned tasking to provide security in D.C. ended after the Jan. 5 rally.

“While the Committee and its members may be able to defame American citizens and organizations from the floor of the Congress with impunity due to the Speech and Debate Clause of the U.S. Constitution,” McAdoo Gordon noted in the letter she sent to the committee yesterday, she reminded the “members that they are not legally at liberty to do so in the media.” And the remarks attributed to Raskin by the Times last week, that the 1st Amendment Praetorian is a “far-right” group with a “role” in the “Capitol attack,” are “false and defamatory,” the letter stressed. “1AP is a mainstream, nonpartisan group with no role whatsoever in the attack on the Capitol.”

1st Amendment Praetorian’s letter added that it “will vigorously defend its reputation, including through defamation lawsuits.” Here, the group noted that “1AP has sued lawyer/Twitterer Seth Abramson for defamation in federal court in New Hampshire (where Mr. Abramson resides) for his defamatory statements that 1AP and its members were involved in the Capitol riot and are ‘insurrectionists’ or ‘seditionists.’” The nonprofit “will be no less vigorous in pursuing its rights against others who defame it, Mr. Lewis, or Mr. Luelsdorff,” the letter continued.

In her letter, McAdoo Gordon also corrected many of the false stories being peddled about the group by detailing exactly what they did and did not do on Jan. 6. Most of the members of 1st Amendment Praetorian had left D.C. after the Jan. 5 rally. But the next day, Lewis and other members of 1st Amendment Praetorian, who had remained in D.C., including Philip Luelsdorff, who is a former U.S. Army Ranger, were asked to provide some additional protection services for the media outlets covering the protest at the Ellipse, which they did, according to McAdoo Gordon. When the rally ended, 1st Amendment Praetorian released the remaining volunteers.

“My clients, Lewis and Luelsdorff, then returned to Willard Hotel, where they were spending the day with the sponsors of the Jan. 5 rally,” McAdoo Gordon told The Federalist. While there, she explained, the hotel staff asked if 1st Amendment Praetorian could help maintain order given the flood of people into the lobby and around the hotel after the Ellipse events ended. 1st Amendment Praetorian agreed, and Luelsdorff voluntarily escorted three individuals to a hotel room where Trump’s lawyers were working and then left a minute later. Neither Luelsdorff nor Lewis had anything to do with the legal team’s work at the Willard Hotel. Nor did they enter the Capitol, Capitol grounds, or even march to the Capitol, McAdoo Gordon stated.

“I was working with the Jan. 6 Committee staff to arrange for my clients to voluntary meet with investigators, within the limits of their First Amendment rights,” McAdoo Gordon explained, when news broke that the Jan. 6 Committee was arguing in federal court that Trump’s former campaign attorney John Eastman should be forced to turn over attorney-client-privileged emails because of a supposed criminal conspiracy between them. “The committee’s pushing of a preposterous Section 371 conspiracy theory left me with no option but to recommend that my clients assert their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination,” McAdoo Gordon told The Federalist.

This reference to a Section 371 conspiracy concerns a section of the federal criminal code that makes it a crime to “conspire to defraud” the United States. In litigation involving Eastman, the Jan. 6 Committee alleged “that President Trump, Dr. Eastman, and others conspired to defraud the United States by disrupting the electoral count,” supposedly in violation of Section 371. But McAdoo Gordon, a longtime white-collar criminal defense lawyer, eviscerated the theory, pointing to recent Supreme Court precedent holding that the scheme or artifice “to defraud” language in another criminal statute could not be interpreted so broadly.

While 1st Amendment Praetorian had nothing to do with any disruption of the electoral count, much less the violence that occurred on Jan. 6, the committee’s McCarthyite tactics raise even graver concerns for McAdoo Gordon. In her letter, she noted her surprise “to see the Committee play a portion of the video testimony of its deposition/meeting with Lt. General Michael Flynn in one of its prior hearings, in which he apparently asserts his privilege under the Fifth Amendment.”

“The Government presenting a person asserting their Fifth Amendment privilege in order to imply to the public that the person is ‘guilty’ of some crime is a McCarthy-esque tactic that offends the Constitution and is unworthy of the United States Congress,” 1st Amendment Praetorian’s lawyer wrote. Given the Committee’s past actions, McAdoo Gordon noted in her Thursday letter that she is “forced to anticipate that the Committee will use the same totalitarian tactic to improperly smear 1AP.”

1st Amendment Praetorian’s letter then stressed that it “has asserted its Fifth Amendment privilege before the Committee solely because the Committee is asserting that groups and persons who never went to the Capitol on January 6, 2021, but had some role in the events that led up to that ultimate riot there, are participants in a criminal conspiracy.” While 1AP “believes itself to be innocent of any wrongdoing or criminal conduct,” the group’s attorney stressed that “since it may find itself as a target of an unfounded criminal investigation, I have advised my clients to assert their Fifth Amendment privilege so that their truthful testimony is not twisted and used against them.”

Quoting from the Supreme Court, McAdoo Gordon then reminded the committee that the high court has described the Fifth Amendment privilege thusly:

[W]e have emphasized that one of the Fifth Amendment’s “basic functions . . . is to protect innocent men . . . `who otherwise might be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances.'”

The letter continued:

“The circumstances in which an innocent citizen finds himself faced with an out-of-control prosecutor, or a mistaken theory of criminality, or an overzealous legislative inquiry — which is the situation 1AP finds itself in — is precisely when the citizen most needs the protection of the Fifth Amendment. For the Congress to attempt to turn that protection into a weapon against a citizen, or a group of citizens, is repellant. I urge the Committee not to engage in such un-American behaviors. Unfortunately, I have little faith that the Committee will heed my appeal. This leaves me with no choice but to pre-emptively speak publicly about these issues before the Committee engages in wholesale defamation of 1AP from its powerful national platform.”

The committee seeks to prove guilt by association, McAdoo Gordon told The Federalist, pointing to the subpoenas issued to 1AP, Lewis, and Luelsdorff, which demand that the nonprofit provide “all documents and communications concerning the participation of individuals employed by or in any way affiliated with 1AP” related to two other rallies in D.C. at which the group provided security, one in mid-November and the second in mid-December. Those rallies had nothing to do with the Jan. 6 violence at the Capitol, but the committee claims an interest in the material because of the identity of the speakers.

The subpoenas also demand that “documents sufficient to identify all employees, officers, and board members” of 1st Amendment Praetorian be turned over to the committee, as well as “all agendas, minutes, notes, or other records related to meetings” of the nonprofit.

The committee, in essence, is demanding a list of 1st Amendment Praetorian’s members — a clear violation of their 1st Amendment rights to free speech, association, and to petition the government, the non-profit’s lawyer told The Federalist: “I told the Committee that they should approach my client like they would the ACLU or the NAACP.”

“If you wouldn’t ask the ACLU or the NAACP the question, don’t ask my client either,” McAdoo Gordon told investigators.

McAdoo Gordon’s reference to the NAACP holds specific significance because the U.S. Supreme Court in NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449 (1958), unanimously ruled that the First Amendment protected the right of the organization and its members’ rights of association and assembly and that the government could not demand that the NAACP reveal its membership list.

Further, for the committee to use subpoenas “to demand financial and fundraising records (including bank account information) and ‘recruitment’ information from a non-profit civic organization, especially a civil liberties group, is wholly unacceptable,” McAdoo Gordon added in the letter. In short, the committee’s treatment of 1AP “is a gross affront to 1st Amendment.”

Every American should be outraged at the attack on our fellow citizens’ First Amendment rights of association, speech, and assembly, McAdoo Gordon, a former long-time member of the ACLU who resigned from the organization after the group abandoned its civil liberties mission, told The Federalist. “And now Congressman Raskin is telling the Times he plans to ‘explore the connection between those groups and the people in Mr. Trump’s orbit.’”

That is precisely what the First Amendment protects Americans from: being investigated because of the individuals with whom they associate. But not only does the Jan. 6 Committee not care, neither does the legacy media. The question remains whether Americans will, or whether they have lost their sense of decency.

J6 Committee Is Using Americans' Assertion Of Rights As Proof Of Guilt,"The Jan. 6 Committee is abusing its power by asking inappropriate questions about their fellow Americans’ beliefs and associates, and publicly portraying witnesses who exercise their Fifth Amendment rights as guilty — all to put on a show trial.

Later on Tuesday, the Jan. 6 Committee will hold yet another public hearing, this one purportedly to focus “on the role of extremists” in the attack on the Capitol. While the precise script for the afternoon’s proceedings remains unknown, last week Democrat Rep. Jamie Raskin previewed the committee’s plans, telling The New York Times that when public hearings resumed in July, “he intends to lead a presentation that will focus on the roles far-right groups like the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers and 1st Amendment Praetorian played in the Capitol attack.” According to the Times, “Mr. Raskin has also promised to explore the connections between those groups and the people in Mr. Trump’s orbit.”

Recycling the Fifth Amendment Tactic

An attorney for 1st Amendment Praetorian, or 1AP, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting free speech, spoke exclusively with The Federalist about the committee’s questioning of 1AP, the group’s founder, and another member of the nonprofit, all of whom she represents. From the framing of the questions posed to her clients, Leslie McAdoo Gordon was left with the firm impression that the Jan. 6 Committee merely wanted video capturing her clients declining to answer the questions for the purpose of impugning their character during the televised hearings.

“The committee knew before the depositions that my clients would be asserting their First and Fifth Amendment rights, and also would not answer any questions because the depositions were being held in violation of the rules established by the House,” McAdoo Gordon told The Federalist. So, shortly after the hearing began and the 1AP witnesses made clear they would not answer any questions, the staffers moved to general topic areas and would ask a few prepared questions, then the committee representative would note that he had more questions on the topic and inquire whether if he asked those questions, the witnesses intended to assert the same objections.

“My clients would respond ‘yes’ to that question, so then the committee would move forward with the next topic,” McAdoo Gordon said. “But after covering various topics, the committee staffer at the end volleyed a litany of individual questions to my clients, forcing them to respond to each question with ‘Rules, First, and Fifth,’ the shorthand we had agreed to with the committee to convey their objections to questions posed.”

Given that the committee had broadcast video of Michael Flynn asserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in an earlier hearing, McAdoo Gordon said she wouldn’t be surprised if Tuesday’s hearings include clips of her clients refusing to answer the committee’s questions.

In fact, she said as much to the committee in a letter last week. After calling the lawmakers out for implying to the public that Flynn was guilty of some crime because he asserted his Fifth Amendment rights, McAdoo Gordon wrote that implying guilt based on a witness asserting his rights, “is a McCarthy-esque tactic that offends the Constitution and is unworthy of the United States Congress.” The attorney added that she is “forced to anticipate that the Committee will use the same totalitarian tactic to improperly smear 1AP.”

The irony is that McAdoo Gordon was working with the committee to arrange for her clients to testify voluntarily, within the bounds of the First Amendment, until the committee concocted what she has called a “cockamamie” criminal conspiracy theory. The committee argued in litigation with former Trump attorney John Eastman “that President Trump, Dr. Eastman, and others conspired to defraud the United States by disrupting the electoral count,” supposedly in violation of Section 371 of the federal criminal code, which makes it a crime to “conspire to defraud” the United States. The committee’s pushing of what she called a “preposterous” legal theory left McAdoo Gordon “with no option but to recommend that my clients assert their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.”

McAdoo Gordon told The Federalist that during her clients’ depositions, the committee asked a series of questions that she likely would have allowed her clients to answer if the meeting had been on a voluntary basis. Putting aside the question of whether the committee was properly constituted, the 1AP’s attorney noted Congress had a legitimate interest in investigating the riots and violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

“What 1AP did, or more accurately put, didn’t do, on Jan. 6 was relevant to the committee’s investigation into the riot and the violence at the Capitol, and I was working to arrange for my clients to voluntarily provide the committee with that information,” McAdoo Gordon said. Likewise, the committee had questions about a couple tweets my clients sent on the sixth, and again, such questions were relevant to the Jan. 6 investigation. “

“But once the committee advanced the absurd Section 371 criminal conspiracy theory, I could no longer recommend my clients speak with the committee,” the attorney explained. McAdoo Gordon did respond to the committee on behalf of her clients, however, after Raskin “falsely described 1AP as a ‘far right’ group with a ‘role’ in the ‘Capitol attack’” in his interview with the Times. “All of those points are false and defamatory,” she told the committee. “1AP is a mainstream, non-partisan group with no role whatsoever in the attack on the Capitol.”

Violating the First Amendment

It isn’t just the Fifth Amendment the committee has been shredding, however. “Even if my clients did not assert the Fifth Amendment, I would have still objected to several questions on First Amendment grounds,” McAdoo Gordon added. While some questions related to Jan. 6 were relevant, the majority of the questions posed to 1AP representatives were none of Congress’s business, McAdoo Gordon stressed. And even the process reveals the warped authoritarianism of the committee, the attorney added.

“At the beginning of the depositions, the congressional staff sought confirmation that we were not recording the proceedings in any way, while they proceeded to video record the questioning,” McAdoo Gordon said. She then noted that while witnesses called before a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., can obtain a transcript of their testimony, the Jan. 6 Committee refuses to allow those they target to obtain transcripts of their subpoenaed testimony.

The committee’s hiding of the transcripts serves to cover their lies and to control the narrative of the show trial, but it also allows the Jan. 6 Committee to hide the wildly inappropriate questions it posed to the witnesses.

“Do you believe in QAnon?” “Do you believe that Joe Biden is the legitimately elected president of the United States?” “What’s your understanding of what happened on 1/6?”

“A Committee of the United States Congress actually asked my clients those questions,” McAdoo Gordon told The Federalist in an exclusive weekend interview.

“Before the deposition, I assured my clients that their political and personal beliefs would not be probed,” the D.C. attorney explained. “While I knew from the subpoenas the Jan. 6 Committee intended to seek constitutionally protected information concerning other 1AP members, my jaw just kept dropping further when they started to question my clients on what they thought and believed.”

The committee also asked Robert Lewis, who is a retired United States Army Green Beret and recipient of the Bronze Star and a Purple Heart, and Philip Luelsdorff, a former U.S. Army Ranger, to describe 1AP activities. For whom and for what purpose did they provide volunteer services? Did they provide security? Surveillance? Assistance with legal activities? What training did they provide? And how were they able to afford to provide the training and volunteer services? Where did the money come from? Who made donations? What bank accounts were used? Did the organization accept cryptocurrency?

Again, none of those questions concerned the events of Jan. 6. Rather, the committee focused on events long before the Jan. 6 events at the Capitol. For instance, it asked whether 1AP provided security for polling places. Other questions concerned 1AP’s security work at a Nov. 14 rally and a Dec. 12 rally.

In essence, the committee is seeking information about 1AP’s members, financial status, donors, and activities. None of that is relevant to the Jan. 6 riots, and all of it is off-limits to the government, the lawyer said. “The Committee had no business asking those questions, so my clients weren’t about to answer them in violation of their First Amendment rights.”

“The Committee had cited as ‘evidence’ against my clients that they obtained a permit for a demonstration the day before the riot. How is obtaining a permit to hold a peaceful protest evidence of a role in a riot the next day? It isn’t,” McAdoo Gordon said. The committee also sought to quiz Lewis and Luelsdorff on their relationship with the Trump family, the White House, the campaign, and numerous specific individuals such as Sidney Powell and Michael Flynn. The staff further asked whether they had been in contact with any of the defense attorneys representing any of the Jan. 6 defendants.

“The government should not be asking a civic organization, which is what 1AP is, about its relationships, in general, with other people, much less about the organization’s donors or lawyers with whom they spoke,” McAdoo Gordon stressed.

Assuming Guilt with Dishonest Framing

Beyond asking inappropriate questions that implicated 1AP’s First Amendment rights, the committee framed several questions in the “do you still beat your wife” format. Before the election, did they provide security “in order to overturn the election”? “Have you engaged in any activities to overturn the certified election results?” “Have you engaged in any activities to reinstall Donald Trump as president of the United States since Jan. 20, 2021?” These questions all presuppose that the “election results” were sought to be “overturned,” as opposed to challenged.

But of course, the Jan. 6 Committee’s focus on the few unfounded claims of election fraud, as opposed to the numerous violations of state election law and evidence of illegal voting — issues Trump and his legal team pursued — aids in the narrative that the protesters wanted to “install” Trump or overturn the election, as opposed to protest election irregularities. And by using a guilt-by-association strategy, the committee paints not just 1AP and its volunteers as complicit in the violence at the Capitol, but every American who attended the rallies and peacefully protested the disastrous 2020 election.

“The committee might be using nicer language, but its questioning is Stalinist in nature nonetheless,” McAdoo Gordon said.

The 1AP lawyer is correct. But because the corrupt media is effectively serving as a state-run press for its preferred politicians, most of America will be oblivious to that fact when the hearings resume later today.

Feds Remember Violence Is Bad After Ignoring Dobbs Attacks,"FBI Director Christopher Wray mysteriously remembered to condemn “violent rhetoric” on Wednesday — in reference to Americans outraged over the FBI’s surprise raid on former President Donald Trump’s private home and refusal (so far) to release the search warrant — after conveniently forgetting to do so when left-wing violence erupted after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision.

“I’m always concerned about threats to law enforcement,” Wray announced 48 hours after news broke of his agency’s raid on Mar-a-Lago. “Violence against law enforcement is not the answer, no matter who you’re upset with.”

He also called online threats against the DOJ “deplorable and dangerous,” choosing failed 2016 candidate Hillary Clinton’s favorite insult for Trump supporters. While legitimate violence should be swiftly shut down, it’s not hard to imagine abuses and extrapolations coming from the same agency that invoked domestic terrorism laws to go after parents who showed up to protest at their kids’ school board meetings.

The media quickly ran with Wray’s attempt to distract from his own agency’s targeting of political opponents by highlighting the reaction from the right and specifically the potential for fringe threats. “Trump’s allies apparently unbothered about possibility of getting someone killed,” Vanity Fair blared. “Authorities monitoring online threats following FBI’s Mar-a-Lago raid,” ABC announced. “Simmering threat of violence comes to fore with search of Trump property,” said The Washington Post.

Oddly enough, I don’t remember hearing the same denunciation of violence after the Supreme Court found it was unconstitutional for the bench to bar elected state legislatures from restricting abortion. In the three months following the Dobbs decision leak, the Family Research Council chronicled 34 attacks on churches and 53 attacks on pro-life organizations and offices and pregnancy care centers. Several of the attacks involved firebombing, attempted arson, and smashing windows on top of threatening or hateful graffiti proclaiming, “If abortions aren’t safe, then you aren’t either.” Radical abortion group “Jane’s Revenge” took credit for many of the attacks, but an FBI spokeswoman in June refused to tell The Federalist whether the group was facing investigation.

Fox News reported that the “Media Research Center found 67 posts threatening or calling for violence against Supreme Court Justices” on social media in the two weeks following the Dobbs decision. People online openly fantasized about killing the justices in the majority, including Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas. Blue check marks on Twitter rushed to insist we should “burn down” the court and the country at large. A shady group called “Ruth Sent Us” published justices’ private home addresses and even suggested targeting the school where Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s children attend. Pro-abortion demonstrators tried to breach the Arizona Capitol. Demonstrators swarmed justices’ private residences in an intimidation campaign. A would-be assassin confessed to an attempt on Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s life and was arrested near the justice’s home.

If any of those threats or violence had come from Trump supporters in the wake of the FBI’s raid on Mar-a-Lago, is there any doubt the FBI would have already dragged them away?

But unlike this time, after the violent outrage over Dobbs, the FBI didn’t come running out with a statement condemning the violence. Its parent, the DOJ, issued a long statement “strongly disagreeing ” with the court’s decision, with only two short sentences in the sixth paragraph promising the DOJ would “not tolerate such acts.” It took 44 days after the Dobbs opinion leaked, however — along with multiple pleas from elected officials — for the FBI to even say it would investigate the incidents. Since then, we’ve heard pitifully little.

Meanwhile, after Dobbs, news outlets such as The Washington Post ran headlines like “When is political violence justified?” which if you look very carefully you can distinguish from their fearmongering about the right’s outrage toward the FBI.

The media and federal law enforcement’s willful ignorance of politically convenient violence over Dobbs was a swing from the dramatic hand-wringing over a foolish riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, which was painted as “deadly” despite the fact that the only person who died as a result of the scuffle was shot by Capitol Police. The prolonged crackdown on law-abiding citizens even remotely affiliated with the peaceful protest that preceded the Capitol riot also constituted an abrupt change from leftists’ push to downplay and bail out violent demonstrators over the summer of 2020 who were useful to Democrats’ political agenda.

The FBI’s reaction to outrage over its targeting of a political enemy is just the latest flip in its continual flop between excusing one brand of political violence and making a dramatic example of another. Almost 80 percent of likely American voters believe there is a two-tiered system of justice in their country, and the FBI’s blatant double standard is proving them right.

The Biden Agenda: America First (To Be Screwed),"Has anyone else noticed that every major measure taken by the Biden administration seems all but designed to either screw Americans, or at a minimum, work to the advantage of everyone but Americans?

Good, so it’s not just me, then.

Let’s look at just a few of them.

The raid of the private residence of a former president (and front runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination). This one is very obviously intended to screw Americans, namely Donald Trump but by extension, his millions of supporters being told to watch their champion harassed and humiliated, not just by his political opposition, but by the nation’s top law enforcement agency.

The ongoing persecution of hundreds of people affiliated with the Jan. 6 riot, the vast majority of whom are ridiculously charged with the crime of being in the Capitol building and aimlessly walking around. Lest there be any doubt that this preoccupation is explicitly designed to screw with Americans, Biden’s Justice Department and Attorney General Merrick Garland are constantly reminding everyone about it with public statements and press releases: “Six Months Since the Jan. 6 Attack on the Capitol”; “Ten Months Since the Jan. 6 Attack on the Capitol”; “One Year Since the Jan. 6 Attack on the Capitol”; “19 Months Since the Jan. 6 Attack on the Capitol.” They’re like a more annoying version of the girls from high school who would mark down the number of days they had a new boyfriend. “It’s our three-week anniversary!” “It’s our one-month!” “Six weeks, aww!”

The billions of dollars in “aid” to Ukraine. Not only are Americans suffering from soaring prices of basic groceries and living expenses thanks to all the welfare Biden and Democrats in Congress needlessly and recklessly doled out in 2021, but we’re also being told it’s our “patriotic duty” to watch as yet billions more are sent to Ukraine to fight a war that Biden helped provoke. Enjoy your $5 box of cereal and don’t you dare ask questions about our mission in Ukraine. Americans get screwed. Ukrainians get rich (and photo spreads in glossy magazines).

The border. Biden invited all of Latin America’s destitute to live right alongside you and your family. Have a heart and screw you!

Energy production. I know it’s supposed to be a big win for Biden that the national gas price average has fallen from the more than $5 per gallon it was two months ago, but recall that it was almost $1 cheaper than this last year. And this was only after Biden began draining our strategic reserves, which are intended for catastrophic crises, like warfare, not for political relief because a president had stupidly decided to shut down oil production in the name of environmentalism. Oh, and then he sent some of our reserves to China. Get screwed, America!

Next question: Does anyone else feel like this is all happening on purpose?

Okay, good, so it’s not just me, then.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/08/17/the-biden-agenda-america-first-to-be-screwed/,2022-08-17
Think The FBI Deserves The Benefit Of The Doubt? Think Again,"Can the FBI be trusted? A Federalist analysis of agency lies over the last decade is an unequivocal no.

FISA Warrants

In the summer of 2016, FBI bureaucrats launched a deep-state operation, known as Crossfire Hurricane, to thwart then-candidate Trump’s presidential ambitions. It began by targeting Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos and quickly branched out as bureaucrats expanded their surveillance. The spy agency used the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) as a legal pretext to investigate and spy on Papadopoulos, in addition to former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, and former Trump adviser Carter Page. Several were interviewed by undercover FBI informant Stefan Halper, whose own investigation would prove a bust.

According to a declassified transcript between Papadopoulos and a Crossfire Hurricane confidential human source (CHS), Papadopoulos repeatedly denied the Trump campaign was working with Russian-backed entities to capture the 2016 election. The FBI, however, wrote off Papadopoulos’s recorded answers as rehearsed and omitted his denials of campaign collusion with overseas actors in FISA court warrant applications and renewals. These were two of the 17 “significant inaccuracies and omissions” identified in the Department of Justice (DOJ) inspector general’s blockbuster report on the investigation in December 2019.

Papadopoulos, who pled guilty to making a false statement to the FBI in a perjury trap, was far from the only individual to face political persecution from the federal government’s dystopian investigation.

Not one of the four FISA warrants obtained by the FBI was legally justified, according to DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s report. In fact, at least two of the warrant applications to spy on Page were declared illegal by a federal judge. Following Horowitz’s blistering report outlining FBI misconduct throughout the entire operation, another federal judge declared that agency malfeasance “calls into question whether information contained in other FBI applications is reliable.”

Subsequent reporting revealed gross abuses of power within the FBI to prosecute political opponents. According to Horowitz, the FBI’s FISA warrants “relied entirely” on DNC-funded opposition research compiled by former British intelligence official Christopher Steele known as the “Steele dossier.” The dossier, which outlined supposed Trump-Russia collusion and has since been thoroughly debunked, included salacious allegations such as supposed “pee tapes” featuring Trump engaging in golden showers with Russian prostitutes at a Moscow hotel.

The FBI knew the dossier lacked credibility as early as January 2017 and knew Steele’s material itself contained Russian disinformation. Desperate to continue their deep-state operation, however, officials lied to the FISA court about Steele’s credibility and hid incriminating info related to the former British intelligence official who was later fired over leaks to the press. An 18th omission, overlooked by the inspector general’s report but documented by Federalist Senior Legal Correspondent Margot Cleveland, was that Steele’s sources did not include the ones he developed as a British official.

Even after Steele’s termination as a reliable source, DOJ attorney Bruce Ohr continued to feed information from Steele to the FBI over the course of its investigation. Steele met with Ohr 12 times after the former’s tenure ended as a confidential human source for the bureau, according to the inspector general. Ohr also promoted his wife’s opposition research to FBI investigators and did not disclose she was paid by Fusion GPS, the DNC-contracted firm that commissioned the Steele dossier.

The FBI never told the FISA court that the Trump dossier written by a source who was fired for lying, did not undergo independent verification, and was funded by Hillary Clinton and the DNC.

Despite the overt abuse of the nation’s surveillance apparatus to spy on political opponents, only one FBI official has faced criminal conviction for his role in the probe. In January last year, former FBI attorney Kevin Clinesmith was sentenced to just 12 months probation after pleading guilty to fabricating evidence to obtain a FISA warrant. By December, Clinesmith was re-admitted to the D.C. Bar Association in good standing.

Steele’s primary sub-source, Igor Danchenko, was indicted in November on five counts of making false statements to the FBI. In May, a D.C. jury acquitted former Clinton campaign attorney Michael Sussmann on charges of lying to the FBI when submitting supposed evidence of Trump-Russian collusion to federal investigators.

Misleading Congress

Following the collapse of the grand Russia-collusion hoax, lawmakers on Capitol Hill began demanding answers about FBI misconduct. Former FBI Director James Comey lied to Congress, claiming the bureau was just investigating four individuals, not the Trump campaign, in a dubious spin.

“Late July of 2016, the FBI did, in fact, open a counterintelligence investigation into, is it fair to say the Trump campaign or Donald Trump himself?” asked then-Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., in a 2018 hearing.

“It’s not fair to say either of those things, in my recollection,” Comey said. “We opened investigations on four Americans to see if there was any connection between those four Americans and the Russian interference efforts. And those four Americans did not include the candidate.”

Horowitz also contradicted the FBI in a December 2019 hearing on the release of his report documenting FISA abuses. In September 2017, the FBI told Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, that the bureau gave the Trump campaign a defensive briefing about Russian interference in the 2016 race.

“In August of 2016 the FBI provided a counterintelligence defensive briefing to then candidate Donald Trump and other senior campaign officials,” wrote FBI Assistant Director of Congressional Affairs Gregory Brower in response to a letter from Grassley. “This defensive briefing was conducted by an experienced FBI counterintelligence agent and focused on the broad range of threats posed by foreign intelligence entities.”

Horowitz testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that there was no briefing given.

Misleading DOJ Leaders

Not only was Congress led astray as FBI officials conducted a rogue operation to defend the incumbent regime, but so was senior leadership in President Trump’s DOJ.

Handwritten notes revealed in the Sussmann trial exposed how FBI agents sought to cover up malicious misconduct, wherein DOJ leaders tasked with FBI oversight were misled about the investigation’s progress. The notes show FBI agent Peter Strzok wrongly told DOJ supervisors the surveillance warrant on Page had been “fruitful.” Strzok also concealed knowledge that Steele’s sources were not credible and claimed instead that the dossier was “CROWN reporting” from MI6, the CIA’s British counterpart. The FBI said the dossier was being used to examine the RNC and Trump campaign’s effort to soften the GOP platform on NATO and Crimea for Russian energy stocks, but the document made no mention of NATO or Crimea.

Strzok also said Trump’s 2016 joke about Russia uncovering Clinton’s 30,000 deleted emails triggered Crossfire Hurricane, with an Australian diplomat tipping off the government about Papadopoulos at the American embassy in London. The tip that Papdopoulos was coordinating collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, however, came before Trump made the joke.

Strzok is the same agent whose text messages show he conspired with his mistress and FBI colleague, attorney Lisa Page. Strzok, a lead investigator for Crossfire Hurricane, assured Page of a mysterious “insurance policy” in place if Trump were to be elected, likely in reference to the agency’s inside operations. Page, according to the DOJ inspector general’s 2019 report, told colleagues to go easy on investigating Clinton because “she might be our next president.”

When Page fretted that Trump might actually win the 2016 contest, Strzok assured his romantic partner, “we’ll stop it.”

Misleading Trump

Comey thought the Crossfire Hurricane investigation was important enough to brief outgoing President Barack Obama on the probe but kept Trump in the dark. In fact, Comey later confirmed that he told Trump three times the president was not being investigated and refused to tell him Clinton funded the dossier.

Michael Flynn

In June 2020, a federal judge ordered that all charges be dropped against Flynn, whom Trump subsequently pardoned in the waning days of his administration. Prior to his exoneration, Flynn was facing heavy fines and prison time for making false statements to federal officials in another perjury trap orchestrated by Comey, who bragged about the setup in the first week of the Trump White House.

According to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Flynn lied to a pair of FBI agents about conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak as the incoming national security adviser. Flynn, prosecutors claimed, spoke with Kislyak about financial sanctions against Russian individuals after the 2016 election and then lied about it during an interview with Comey’s agents. Sending a pair of agents to question a senior White House official in the Situation Room, Comey said at a 2018 conference, was “something I probably wouldn’t have done or even gotten away with in a more organized investigation, a more organized administration.”

“We placed a call to Flynn and said, ‘Hey, we’re sending a couple guys over, hope you’ll talk to them.’ He said ‘sure,'” Comey explained at the 92nd Street Y conference. “Nobody else was there, they interviewed him in a conference room at the White House situation room, and he lied to them.”

Flynn initially pled guilty to making false statements to the FBI before firing his attorneys and hiring new representation to withdraw his guilty plea. His reversal followed the release of declassified transcripts, which revealed Flynn never spoke with Kislyak about sanctions. The two only discussed expulsions of Russian individuals under a different process. Handwritten notes from the FBI agents also revealed the sole purpose of their questioning was “to get him to lie so we can prosecute him or get him fired.” A bizarre 2017 inauguration day email by Susan Rice to herself also revealed Comey knew there was no legitimate reason to question Flynn.

Andrew McCabe

Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was fired from his top role at the bureau for lying to the agency inspector general four times over multiple abuses during his tenure in senior leadership. Those abuses included efforts to set up former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus for obstruction charges, the sabotage of an investigation into Clinton emails on Anthony Weiner’s laptop before the 2016 election, and failure to report conflicts of interest. While running for a Virginia state Senate seat in 2015, McCabe’s wife accepted a political donation from a close Clinton ally as her husband was tasked with investigating the former secretary of state.

A 2018 DOJ inspector general report blasted McCabe as a serial leaker who lied about it. That same year, a letter from Grassley shined a spotlight on McCabe’s purchase of a $70,000 table on taxpayers’ dime that the agency sought to cover up.

Clinton Emails

The FBI repeatedly told journalists there was no evidence that a foreign power had reviewed Clinton’s emails that she improperly handled on a private server. According to an inspector general report in 2018, however, texts show they almost certainly did, “at least one of them classified,” as Federalist Senior Editor David Harsanyi wrote.

“It is more accurate to say,” read a text from Strzok, “that we know foreign actors obtained access to some of her emails (including at least one Secret one) via compromises of the private email accounts of some of her staffers.”

Weiner Laptop

In 2018, Comey told lawmakers over the course of the investigation into Clinton’s emails that agency officials thoroughly reviewed the laptop belonging to Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her now-ex husband Anthony Weiner. The FBI was able to accomplish such a feat within a short timeframe “thanks to the wizardry of our technology” enabling agents who worked “night after night after night” to comb through the remaining material before the 2016 election.

“But virtually none of his account was true,” explained RealClearInvestigations’ Paul Sperry.

In fact, a technical glitch prevented FBI technicians from accurately comparing the new emails with the old emails. Only 3,077 of the 694,000 emails were directly reviewed for classified or incriminating information. Three FBI officials completed that work in a single 12-hour spurt the day before Comey again cleared Clinton of criminal charges.

Roger Stone

In 2019, former Trump associate Roger Stone was raided by the FBI after being indicted by Mueller. A CNN camera crew happened to be the only network present at Stone’s Fort Lauderdale home before the sunrise raid, suggesting the friendly press had been tipped off in advance. The FBI, however, refused to comply with a Federalist open records request for any and all emails to or from CNN on the day of the raid.

Jan. 6 Capitol Riot

The Jan. 6 saga has become the sequel in Democrats’ efforts to indict Trump, before FBI agents hatched a plot to go after the former president over supposed espionage.

In October, the bureau refused to offer House Republicans conducting their own independent investigation of the Capitol riot the same material given to congressional Democrats. The FBI’s refusal, the agency claimed, was because officials were already working with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s Select Committee on Jan. 6. Pelosi’s committee, however, was established in violation of House rules. Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., the minority appointment as ranking member, is entitled to the documents presented to Democrats.

Senior FBI officials have also refused lawmakers’ questions about how many informants were present at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and stonewalled inquiries surrounding Ray Epps, the mysterious figure who disappeared from the most-wanted list after he encouraged rioters to swarm the Capitol.

At an Aug. 4 Senate hearing, FBI Director Christopher Wray sought to downplay agency negligence, claiming “we did not have any credible intelligence that pointed to thousands of people breaching the Capitol.” But according to Newsweek, the agency deployed commandos with “shoot to kill authority,” and even Capitol Hill parking attendants knew there were going to be mass protests. The FBI has also been less than forthcoming about a pair of pipe bombs planted at the RNC and DNC headquarters.

At the same time, the FBI has embarked on a nationwide manhunt, to incarcerating demonstrators who have been declared such a threat to the republic over trespassing that they’ve been denied a fair and speedy trial and held in detention for more than 18 months.

Julian Khater, one of two accused of assaulting a Capitol Police officer with pepper spray and whose case has been documented by Julie Kelly at American Greatness, appears to have been outright coerced into making an unconstitutional confession. Khater was detained in March 2021 and has remained in federal custody ever since after intense interrogation without an attorney present.

Kamala Harris on Jan. 6

The presence of Vice President Mike Pence and then-Sen. Kamala Harris at the U.S. Capitol has been the basis for nearly 800 people being charged with at least one count of violating 18 U.S. Code, section 1752, according to Kelly, which indicates that any building or complex hosting the vice president is a restricted area and therefore closed to the public.

“But the Justice Department recently was forced to admit that Harris was not in the building for most of the day on January 6,” Kelly reported, highlighting that Harris, at the time, remained a U.S. senator, not vice president. In the late morning, Harris was moved to the DNC headquarters where a pipe bomb had supposedly been planted.

“Prosecutors have begun amending language in court filings to reflect the fact Harris was not inside the Capitol despite making the assertion in thousands of charging documents,” Kelly wrote.

March 4, 2021

The FBI released a joint memo with the Department of Homeland Security warning that “domestic extremists” were preparing to launch an insurrection by overwhelming the Capitol and removing Democratic lawmakers “on or about the 4th of March.”

Nothing happened.

Hunter Biden Suppression

In July, Grassley’s office published a blockbuster whistleblower report wherein senior agency officials alleged that the bureau is actively trying to sabotage Trump and provide cover for President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter.

“Multiple FBI whistleblowers, including those in senior positions,” Grassley’s office wrote in a press release, “are raising the alarm about tampering by senior FBI and Justice Department officials in politically sensitive investigations ranging from election and campaign finance probes across multiple election cycles.”

Washington Field Office Assistant Special Agent in Charge Timothy Thibault and Director of Election Crimes Branch Richard Pilger, the whistleblowers alleged, coordinated to amplify defamatory information against Trump while giving cover to Hunter Biden, dismissing Biden intelligence as disinformation.

The agency reportedly knew of Hunter Biden’s abandoned laptop full of incriminating information on the first family as early as 2019, and Grassley’s whistleblower report highlights how officials may have undermined DOJ investigations into Hunter Biden’s finances in Delaware and Pittsburgh. In March, FBI Assistant Director of the Cyber Division Bryan Vorndran told lawmakers he did not know the whereabouts of Hunter Biden’s laptop.

Gretchen Whitmer Plot

In October 2020, the FBI revealed that a plot to kidnap Michigan Democrat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer had been heroically foiled by federal law enforcement. A group of far-right militiamen, the story goes, conspired to kidnap the governor and try her as a “tyrant” in Wisconsin. In July last year, however, BuzzFeed revealed that at least 12 people involved were FBI informants orchestrating another entrapment.

“The problem with the case is that it appears the FBI, through informants and undercover agents, hatched the kidnapping plot, served in the key leadership positions of the militia group, trained the militia members in military tactics, actively recruited participants, and funded much of the militia’s activities,” reported former CIA Paramilitary Operations Officer Max Morton. “Then, when various members of the Watchman militia became uncomfortable with the kidnapping plot, with several quitting, the FBI’s primary informant pushed the plot along, eventually becoming the militia group’s leader.”

In April, a jury refused to convict four of the 14 defendants charged. Two were found not guilty, another two concluded the trial with no verdict, and another two took plea deals.

Ralph Northam Plot

Dan Chappel, the primary informant in the Whitmer kidnapping conspiracy, targeted a senior disabled veteran named Frank Butler using the same formula to go after then-Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, another Democrat.

“Just as in the Whitmer plot, Chappel lured Frank Butler into attempting to build an explosive device,” Kelly explained in American Greatness. “Chappel also invited Butler to a field training exercise in Wisconsin during the last weekend in October, an excursion attended by some defendants in the Whitmer caper.”

Unlike the FBI’s victims in the Whitmer plot, however, Butler did not participate and has not been charged with any crime.

Sen. Ted Stevens’ Conviction

Former Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, became the victim of FBI corruption in 2008 when forced to defend himself on charges of false statements to federal officials. Stevens lost his seat as the scandal played out, only to be later exonerated when a judge conducting an independent investigation concluded that prosecutors inappropriately hid evidence.

Prosecutors indicted Stevens on charges that he had concealed that he did not pay full value for renovations on an Alaskan cabin less than 100 days out from the 2008 election.

“In fact, Ted Stevens and his wife had paid more than $160,000 for renovations that independent appraisers valued at less than $125,000 at the time,” Roll Call reported.

Prosecutors, however, secured a conviction by hiding evidence that incriminated their own witnesses, one of whom came up with testimony right before trial, with inconsistent statements concealed from the defense, according to the D.C. paper.

Likewise, the government concealed evidence that its star witness had suborned perjury from an underage prostitute with whom the star witness had an illegal sexual relationship. And the government concealed evidence that another witness — whom the government flew back to Alaska away from the Washington, D.C., trial after their mock cross-examination of him went poorly — had told the senator that the bills he received and promptly paid included all of the work that was done. Government prosecutors mocked Stevens when he explained that on the stand — all the while knowing that they had a witness who would have supported him, but whom they had removed from the trial.

Rep. Jeff Fortenberry’s Conviction

Former Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, R-Neb., was sentenced to two years of probation with a $25,000 fine and 320 hours of community service in March after a Los Angeles jury convicted him of lying to the federal government after he was entrapped by the FBI.

The saga began in 2019 when a pair of FBI agents showed up at Fortenberry’s Nebraska home ostensibly over a national security issue, not a criminal investigation. Prosecutors ultimately convicted Fortenberry for scheming to conceal material facts to federal officials and two false statements to the FBI.

One false statement was attributed to Forteberry not recognizing a person whose 10-year-old picture was presented to him by agents on their trip to his Nebraska residence. In July 2019, the FBI lied to Fortenberry and his attorney, Gowdy, claiming Fortenberry was not under federal investigation when he was. Fortenberry resigned from the House during his ninth term following conviction.

Pulse Nightclub Shooting

In June 2016, a 29-year-old gunman named Omar Mateen stormed the gay Orlando nightclub Pulse, killing 49 and injuring 53 more in the name of Islamic terrorists killed in Iraq and Syria. Mateen’s father, Seddique, was an FBI informant, whom documents published by The Intercept suggest convinced the bureau to stop investigating his son.

The bureau turned instead to charging Mateen’s widow, Noor Salman, with material support and obstruction of justice. Prosecutors sought to conceal the father’s status as an FBI informant, according to the Intercept, in pursuit of Salman’s conviction.

“Seddique Mateen has not faced criminal charges despite a tip to the FBI that he raised money for terrorism in Pakistan, and an ongoing investigation into money transfers he allegedly made to Turkey and Afghanistan,” the Intercept reported. “Omar Mateen was researching flights to Turkey at the same time that his father was sending payments there, according to defense lawyers’ summary of FBI evidence.” Salmon was apparently unaware of their possible plans to travel to either country.

Meanwhile, the New York Times reported on Salmon’s 2018 trial:

Testimony from an F.B.I. agent revealed that prosecutors knew early on, but did not reveal, that one of their crucial initial pieces of evidence — that Ms. Salman had admitted driving by the nightclub with her husband in the days before the attack — most likely did not happen.

Salmon was ultimately acquitted after a 12-hour jury deliberation.

Texas Synagogue Attack

On Jan. 15, 44-year-old Malik Faisal Akram took hostages in a Texas synagogue near Dallas and demanded the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani national also known as “Lady Al Qaeda” serving an 86-year sentence for assault and attempted murder of federal agents and military personnel.

Matthew J. DeSarno, the FBI’s special agent in charge of the Dallas field office, said the attack on a synagogue had nothing to do with targeting Jews.

“We do believe from our engagement with this subject that he was singularly focused on one issue, and it was not specifically related to the Jewish community,” DeSarno said at a press conference.

But as Chuck DeVore of the Texas Public Policy Foundation reported, Akram “was heard to say via the live stream that operated from the synagogue for much of the incident that he chose it because he thought it was the closest assemblage of Jews to the federal facility holding Siddiqui.”

“There are about 1,000 churches in the Fort Worth area within a half-hour drive of Siddiqui’s place of incarceration, compared to seven Jewish centers of worship,” DeVore wrote. “But sure, Special Agent DeSarno, the terrorism was ‘not specifically threatening to the Jewish community.'”

Congressional Baseball Shooter

The FBI designated the death of a shooter who attempted to gun down Republican lawmakers at a 2017 congressional baseball practice as motivated by a desire to commit “suicide by cop.” Last year, the bureau doubled down on the designation.

“It’s fair to say the shooter was motivated by a desire to commit an attack on members of Congress and then knowing by doing so he would likely be killed in the process,” Jill Sanborn, the executive assistant director of the FBI, told the House Appropriations subcommittee.

“The FBI still doesn’t know exactly what the shooter was up to,” McCabe, now a CNN contributor, said last summer. “They never really uncovered the sort of detailed evidence that laid out a specific plot or an objective.”

On the contrary, the 66-year-old shooter who almost killed House GOP Whip Steve Scalise left behind a long record of extremist social media posts dripping with contempt for Republicans, even branding them as the “Taliban of the USA” on Facebook. The FBI also found a list of six congressmen in a rented Virginia storage locker but refused to call it a “hit list.”

Inflating Extremism Cases

Whistleblowers claim the FBI is inflating the number of “domestic violent extremism” cases to fit President Biden’s overarching narrative that home-grown extremism is the nation’s worst national security threat.

“From recent protected disclosures, we have learned that FBI officials are pressuring agents to reclassify cases as ‘domestic violent extremism’ even if the cases do not meet the criteria for such a classification,” Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, wrote in July, detailing whistleblower allegations in a letter to Wray. “Given the narrative pushed by the Biden Administration that domestic violent extremism is the ‘greatest threat’ facing our country, the revelation that the FBI may be artificially padding domestic terrorism data is scandalous.”

Ignoring Larry Nassar Abuse

The FBI turned a blind eye as former USA gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar abused dozens of young female athletes. According to the DOJ inspector general last year, “senior officials in the FBI Indianapolis Field Office failed to respond to allegations of sexual abuse of athletes by former USA Gymnastics physician Lawrence Gerard Nassar with the urgency that the allegations required.”

“We also found that the FBI Indianapolis Field Office made fundamental errors when it did respond to the allegations, failed to notify the appropriate FBI field office (the Lansing Resident Agency) or state or local authorities of the allegations, and failed to take other steps to mitigate the ongoing threat posed by Nassar,” the inspector general added.

Kyle Rittenhouse

Kyle Rittenhouse was acquitted of politicized charges brought against him last summer when he shot three men in self-defense. Two died, and contrary to the media’s racialized coverage of the trial, all three were white.

During the proceedings, wherein an 18-year-old Rittenhouse (now 19) faced life in prison, prosecutors used aerial footage from FBI surveillance in their effort to convict Rittenhouse. When the defense tried to access “the rest” of the FBI footage from the night in question, however, the bureau claimed it no longer existed.

Demonizing James Rosen

In 2010, the Obama administration began aggressive surveillance of journalist James Rosen who was working for Fox News at the time. The Justice Department tracked Rosen by falsely claiming the reporter was a potential terrorist collaborator and accused him of violating the Espionage Act.

The Obama administration tracked Rosen’s movements and, according to Fox News, even seized the phone records of his parents.

Deadly Wrongful Conviction

A 2007 ruling against the government cost the FBI $102 million after agency misconduct resulted in the deaths of two men. In order to protect a mob informant, the FBI was caught deliberately withholding evidence in a case that led to the wrongful convictions of four men, three of which were sentenced to death, two of whom died before true justice was served.

Martha Stewart

Most Americans today believe Martha Stewart was convicted 20 years ago on charges of “insider trading.” Her actual conviction that sent her to federal prison was conspiracy to lie about the crime for which she was never charged over a trade that had already taken place.

Stewart’s quarter-million-dollar sale of ImClone stock served as the pretext for which federal prosecutors, led by none other than Comey, went after the media mogul. Comey’s case, however, was so weak that prosecutors pursued a novel legal theory to secure a conviction.

According to the theory they pursued, Stewart engaged in “securities fraud” when she declared that she was innocent, which prosecutors said was designed to prop up the value of her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. In other words, Stewart’s proclamation of innocence was declared a crime by federal law enforcement, and she spent six months incarcerated.

Mar-a-Lago Raid

The Department of Justice appears to be following the same playbook agency officials have used for years in the Democrats’ series of manufactured scandals to bring down Trump.

Last week, the FBI executed an unprecedented raid of the former president’s Florida residence ostensibly conducted to enforce the Presidential Records Act. Federal officials confiscated more than a dozen boxes from the 128-room mansion pursuant to the rarely prosecuted law, claiming Trump harbored classified information related to the nation’s nuclear secrets. Leaked claims to the Washington Post that Trump possessed sensitive nuclear records, which came hours after Attorney General Merrick Garland professed the agency’s professionalism, however, showcase the sensationalism crafted by officials desperate to justify the raid, which included more than 30 agents.

At a press conference last week, Garland admitted to personally signing off on the raid he called “narrowly scope[d].” An examination of the warrant, however, reveals that it authorized FBI agents to seize any and every document Trump came into contact with as president. Furthermore, none of the three criminal statutes the DOJ cited in the warrant required the material to be classified, according to Cleveland.

The FBI also attempted to dispel claims that federal officials stripped the president of his passports, telling CBS News that the agency was not in possession of the documents after Trump blasted that they had been confiscated. An email made public by Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich, however, exposed the FBI’s lie. The email from Jay Bratt, the chief of the counterintelligence and export control section in the DOJ’s National Security Division, confirms that “the filter agents seized three passports belonging to President Trump, two expired and one being his active diplomatic passport.”",https://thefederalist.com/2022/08/19/think-the-fbi-deserves-the-benefit-of-the-doubt-this-laundry-list-of-corruption-should-make-you-think-again/,2022-08-19
Roy Moore Defeated Defamers And The 'Actual Malice' Standard,"On Aug. 12, a federal court jury in Alabama fired off an unmistakable message to the media and the D.C. swamp: “Stop lying and stop corrupting our elections. There will be consequences if you don’t.” That message was sent in the form of an $8.2 million verdict for defamation in favor of former Alabama Supreme Court Justice and senatorial candidate Roy Moore against a major Democratic player and his allies.

The jury found the Senate Majority PAC, a Democrat-aligned and sponsored “super PAC,” guilty of defamation. After a five-day trial the jury determined that Senate Majority PAC defamed Moore by painting him in a false light with false allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls.

Moore, a West Point graduate and Vietnam veteran, had been a controversial figure in Alabama politics, stemming at least from when he became known as the “Ten Commandments Judge” after installing a granite monument in the Alabama courts building that included a depiction of the Ten Commandments. In 2017, he was in a special election contest against Democrat Doug Jones to fill the Alabama Senate seat formerly held by Jeff Sessions.

A Brutal Election Campaign

To grasp the message that the jury appears to have been sending, it is necessary to consider the tone of the 2017 special election, the background of some of the key players, and a bit about the defenses raised.

To say that the election was hotly contested is an understatement. “Vicious” is not too strong a word. The federal court described the barrage of what appeared to be well-coordinated attacks on Moore by the New York Times, the Washington Post, Senate Majority PAC, and others, as a “firestorm of sexual assault allegations.”

The brutality of the campaign against Moore is illustrated by one of Senate Majority PAC’s defenses to his defamation claims. Senate Majority PAC urged the court that Moore could not recover any damages for loss of reputation because the attacks by the media and others had already “ruined Moore’s reputation beyond repair.”

The Swamp’s Super PAC

Senate Majority PAC was not just a major player in the Alabama elections, but a major player in the dark-money world of Democratic finances. Its size and clout can be measured by the money it raised in the 2020 election cycle: more than $372 million.

Open Secrets reports that Senate Majority PAC spent more than $230 million on federal elections, of which less than $15 million was spent on contributions “for Democrats.” Its contributions to Republicans were exactly zero. Senate Majority PAC did not ignore Republicans, however. It spent its remaining $215 million “against Republicans.” In short, 6 percent of its $230 million spent on elections was for a positive message “for Democrats” and the remaining 94 percent was on negative ads and attacks on Republicans.

As a bona fide member of the Washington swamp, Senate Majority PAC does not appear to have been totally transparent about what it was doing. Aware that Alabama voters might recoil from a Washington dark-money outfit jumping in to sway an Alabama election, Senate Majority PAC acted through another super PAC that attempted to present itself as more local.

Highway 31 was a “puppet PAC” formed to create the impression that the well-funded opposition to Moore was locally based. Formed by a Birmingham lawyer and named after a well-known north-south highway in Alabama, Highway 31 received 94 percent of its funding from Senate Majority PAC and another PAC called Priorities USA. Priorities USA is another self-described “progressive” super PAC based in D.C. that appears to be financially intertwined with Senate Majority PAC. Politico described the Priorities-Senate Majority PAC collaboration in Highway 31 as a “joint effort” between the two. A Senate Majority PAC spokesman admitted it was Highway 31’s “primary backer.”

After the election, its mission accomplished, Highway 31 self-terminated and dissolved. Jones ultimately won the Senate seat, and Highway 31’s vicious ads were credited with contributing to his small victory over Moore. For its part, Senate Majority PAC took credit for the libelous Highway 31 ads.

The Supreme Court’s Malice Requirement

After the Supreme Court’s decision in New York Times v. Sullivan in 1964, the media and political actors have had basically free rein to libel and slander their opponents without giving much thought (or investigation) into whether their charges are true. Political candidates and other public figures have effectively been barred from filing defamation suits, no matter how vicious and egregious the lies. That is because to succeed they must prove that the defendants had “actual malice.” That is an extremely high bar that is, in the words of former Supreme Court Justice Bryon White, an “almost impossible” standard.

It is not enough to show that defendants personally hate the person they are attacking, even with lies. To succeed a plaintiff must show that a defendant knew or “recklessly disregarded” whether the statements were false. Stated another way, if Highway 31 had reason to think that their false statements were true, that would be a complete defense. It is enough to show that the same lies had been told repeatedly by the media so that a defendant can claim that he thought the statements were true because he had read them elsewhere. Indeed, the court dismissed some of the false statements by defendants in Moore’s suit for this very reason.

The difficulty of proving this sort of “actual malice” discourages most public figures from defending their reputations when they are attacked, no matter how vicious the lies. And for the few public figures who do try, the successes are few and far between.

The Trial and Verdict

Moore’s defamation claim against Senate Majority PAC focused on a Highway 31 TV ad “that said Moore ‘was actually banned from the Gadsden Mall … for soliciting sex from young girls.’” Moore v. Cecil, 488 F. Supp. 3d 1144 (N.D. Ala. 2020). But, the challenge for Moore was not just to prove that it was a lie. He also had to overcome the “almost impossible” burden of proving actual malice.

After a five-day trial, the eight-person jury retired to deliberate. Typically, after a trial of that length, with 17 witnesses and no fewer than 254 exhibits, the jury will deliberate for a number of hours, perhaps into the following days. This jury, however, was back in 90 minutes with an $8.2 million verdict for Moore on two separate counts, defamation and “invasion of privacy, false light.” That is an extraordinarily quick result for a trial of this type and a multimillion-dollar verdict.

In response to nine specific written questions from the court, the jury found that Moore had proved by “clear and convincing evidence” that Senate Majority PAC intentionally published a false and defamatory statement and “false information” about Moore. The jury also found that SMP published the untrue statement “with actual malice (that is, SMP knew that a statement was false or acted with reckless disregard as to whether a statement was false)”.

The verdict should be a wake-up call for the media and others who publish attack ads. Up to now, they have not had to worry a great deal about whether their attacks are true, any more than they flinch at spreading falsehoods to destroy the lives of their targets and their families.

This has been destructive to our system for many reasons. Many qualified people will not even consider running for office because they refuse to subject themselves to such scurrilous character assassination. The Alabama jury’s verdict can be seen as a clear message that the outside-the-Beltway population is fed up with the universal lies and character assassination. Prudent media and political players should take note.

When asked what message the media and others should take from this verdict, Moore’s lawyer, Baton Rouge attorney Jeffrey Wittenbrink, said he thinks this was a clear signal that the American people are “at the end of the rope when it comes to allegations of sexual impropriety that come years after the (alleged) fact and just in time to derail elections or confirmations.”

Moore told me in an interview that despite the verdict, he has not received an apology from anyone associated with Senate Majority PAC. Consistent with that lack of remorse or apology, as of the publication of this article, the defamatory Highway 31 ad is still available on YouTube.

Senate Majority PAC, of course, may elect to appeal. If so, it could regret its decision. If the case goes to the Supreme Court, there is a chance the court could do away with the obligation for public figures to prove actual malice. Many legal scholars and at least two current Supreme Court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas, have urged such a reconsideration of the judge-invented malice requirement because, in the words of Justice White, “by leaving the lie uncorrected the New York Times rule plainly leaves the public official without a remedy for the damage to his reputation.”

Trying to keep political actors honest is a Sisyphean task under the best of circumstances. But the Alabama jury’s verdict is a step in the right direction. A reversal of the judge-made malice standard would be an even greater step. Such a reversal might be bad for the dark-money crowd but would be good for the American people, liberals and conservatives alike.

"Abortionists, Not Pregnancy Centers, Are Who's Lying To Women","Sen. Lindsey Graham is forcing Democrats to either admit their abortion extremism or vote for legislation that would enact a nationwide ban at 15 weeks of pregnancy, a limit on par with most European countries. But before this week’s outcry over Graham’s proposed 15-week ban, Democratic lawmakers were already revealing just how far they will go to appease the pro-abortion groups from which they receive significant campaign contributions.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bob Menendez, D-N.J., along with Reps. Suzanne Bonamici, D-Ore., and Carolyn B. Maloney, D-N.Y., escalated the ghoulish attacks on pregnant women and crisis pregnancy centers with the introduction of the “Stop Anti-Abortion Disinformation Act.” While there is certainly an abundance of abortion disinformation harming women and children in this country, it’s not coming from pro-lifers and pro-life organizations serving those women and children.

Warren and her fellow Democrat lawmakers are smearing pregnancy resource centers as “fake clinics” that “mislead women about reproductive health care.” Their bill would order the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to “crack down” on these centers by targeting and penalizing them for anything the FTC determines is “misleading advertising.”

Democrats’ attacks on pregnancy centers and clinics reveal just how wicked their motives are when you consider how millions of women facing unplanned pregnancies are served every year by these community-based, nonprofit organizations. The National Institute of Family & Life Advocates (NIFLA) estimates that U.S. pregnancy centers provide more than $267 million worth of free essential support services including medical services (pregnancy testing, ultrasound, and STI testing), parenting classes, maternity clothes, baby clothes, formula, and diapers.

“Women who have been served by pregnancy help organizations overwhelmingly give them satisfactory ratings,” Jor-El Godsey, president of Heartbeat International, told The Federalist. “Women are smart, capable beings who deserve to have all the information about their pregnancy options so they can make informed decisions about their futures,” he said.

The real deception and lying to women about their options come from abortion providers like Planned Parenthood. Of course, Democrats would only be hurting their own pocketbooks to admit that or to suggest abortion facilities also be investigated by the FTC.

Planned Parenthood’s Misinformation

If the FTC wanted to seriously investigate abortion misinformation, Planned Parenthood would be a good place to start. The organization performs 1 in 3 abortions in the United States and has built its business on billions of taxpayer dollars, making it worthy of scrutiny no matter your politics.

Planned Parenthood brands itself as offering “health care,” but by admission via its own 2020-2021 annual report, the organization’s emphasized service of choice is abortion. Last year they performed 383,460 abortions. That number dwarfs the number of prenatal services, 8,775, and adoption referrals, 1,940, provided.

Another popular lie Planned Parenthood often hides behind is the claim that it provides “cancer screenings,” particularly via mammograms. Planned Parenthood may offer breast exams and pap smear tests, but it is a fabrication to say they provide mammograms, which would require a particular certification they don’t have. Yet, pro-abortion advocates like former Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards, top HHS officials, and even former President Barack Obama have been caught spreading the popular myth.

Finally, it has been documented through testimonies of former Planned Parenthood employees as well as surveys of post-abortive women that Planned Parenthood workers often lie to women about the developmental state of their unborn babies. According to one study, 90 percent of women said they were “not given enough information to make an informed decision” and 95 percent said Planned Parenthood counselors gave “little or no biological information about the fetus which the abortion would destroy.”

NIFLA’s Vice President of Legal Affairs Anne O’Connor told The Federalist that bills similar to Warren’s “Stop Anti-Abortion Disinformation Act” have been introduced for decades but never gain any momentum because they are clearly political ploys that only hurt women and children.

“Pregnancy centers provide a safe, non-conflicted space for a woman to assess the information about all her choices and make an informed decision that’s right for her. These centers are there for women no matter what they choose,” O’Connor said. “They don’t provide or refer for abortions and they are clear about that.”

Democrats’ attacks on pregnancy centers are not just nefarious but misplaced. Planned Parenthood is the one lying to women about their options, not pro-lifers.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/09/14/democrats-ghoulish-attacks-on-pregnancy-centers-ignores-who-is-really-lying-to-women-planned-parenthood/,2022-09-14
Hank Johnson: Parents 'Descended' On School Boards 'Like Jan. 6',"In a Wednesday committee hearing, Democrat Rep. Hank Johnson smeared all parents who advocate for their children at school board meetings as “MAGA Republicans” who “descend[ed] on their school board meetings” in a “coordinated attack.”

“People on the local level at affected school board meetings, they won’t forget the MAGA Republicans descending on their school board meetings after January 6 — like January 6,” Johnson stated. “It was a coordinated attack happening across the country.”

Rep. Hank Johnson (D-GA):



""People at school board meetings will never forget MAGA Republicans descending on their school board meetings just like they did on January 6. It was a coordinated attack happening across the country."" pic.twitter.com/8iZnSwRn94 — Greg Price (@greg_price11) September 14, 2022

The parents to whom Johnson is referring garnered national attention after they showed up peacefully to give public comment and protest at their children’s school board meetings in response to draconian Covid-19 mandates, critical race theory, and wildly inappropriate sexual content in public schools. Unlike a few rioters who were present on Jan. 6, parents at school board meetings almost universally followed rules for public comment and protested without bucking established rules and laws.

Asra Q. Nomani, a mom from Fairfax County, Virginia, and a senior contributor at The Federalist, is one of the parents who spoke up. Nomani stood in front of her school board in March to describe the “new racism” pushed by the school system directed toward Asian Americans like herself, “whose children’s success in K-12 schools belie the notion that systemic racism oppresses all minorities.” Like thousands of other parents, she exercised her freedoms of speech and assembly nonviolently.

Former Disney star Leigh-Allyn Baker is another parent who took to her children’s school board meeting, to voice her opinions against the school’s mask mandate. In addition to concerns about children not being able to properly “breathe oxygen” through masks, her main point was this: “The real part of the clown show is that you all think that you actually have the authority to mandate this.” Baker was not violent while addressing the school board, nor did she start a riot or “insurrection.”

But even after Democrats spent months describing fiery riots perpetrated by their own ideologues as “mostly peaceful protests,” they were more than willing — as Johnson did — to smear these parents for daring to speak out against local tyrants.

The National School Boards Association went so far as to equate these parents’ peaceful assembly and speech “to a form of domestic terrorism and hate crimes” in a letter asking the Biden administration and federal law enforcement to go after parents using domestic terrorism laws. Attorney General Merrick Garland used the letter as an excuse to sic the FBI and state attorneys on parents, even though most of the examples in the NSBA letter never warranted arrests or charges even at the local level. It was soon revealed that Biden’s Education Secretary Miguel Cardona appeared to have commissioned the letter, and the NSBA issued an apology for sending it. Democrats like Johnson, however, are still spreading its lies.

Johnson’s statement also exposes Democrats’ continued distortion and obsession over the events at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. There were some people who did riot and forcibly enter the Capitol almost two years ago. But there were also thousands of Americans who peacefully protested in Washington D.C. that day, concerned about the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election results. Unfortunately, Democrats refuse to make this distinction, instead lumping all people there that day (and indeed, all of their political opponents) into the category of “insurrectionist.”

Johnson’s baseless accusations and comparison of concerned parents to rioters are false and damaging, and show just how exhaustively Democrats will use “Jan. 6” smears as a political cudgel. All that his comments achieve is misconstruing what is actually happening at school board meetings and furthering the divide in our nation.

New York Times Attacks Hasidic Jews Because They Resist Leftism,"We should all be concerned by The New York Times’ war on yeshivas. The regime’s flagship paper has launched a campaign against New York’s Hasidic Jewish schools, coordinating its reporting and editorial opinions with politicians and officials fighting to further regulate these private religious institutions. It is a political and public relations blitzkrieg that lumps all yeshivas together in order to target them all at once.

There are real problems with some yeshivas. In particular, some are focused on rigorous traditional religious instruction to the neglect of English, math, civics, and other basic subjects. But instead of focusing on specific schools that are failing in this way, the Times chose to launch an attack on yeshivas in general, leading with a sprawling article that often dragged in tangential religious and cultural matters, sometimes of dubious reliability.

For example, the Times devoted a lot of space to the use of corporal punishment in yeshivas. But it conflates allegations of genuine abuse (e.g., a teacher kicking a 4-year-old) with minor physical discipline of the sort that used to be unremarkable, such as rapping a student’s knuckles with a ruler. Notably, there is little hard evidence of systemic abuse, with the paper finding that over the past five years, the NYPD “investigated more than a dozen claims of child abuse at the schools,” but that it “is not clear whether anyone was charged in the incidents.” A few complaints a year is not a lot.

A similar dud is the Times’ report that in some yeshivas, “Secular textbooks are either censored with black marker to blot out images of girls and pigs … or specially printed to omit such content altogether.” This detail seems less about critiquing educational problems and more about highlighting the otherness of Hasidic Jews — is it really relevant that a yeshiva blacked out the names of Christian holidays in a textbook?

Setting aside these irrelevant, prejudicial details (which are especially egregious given the rising violence against Jews, especially Hasidic Jews, in New York), the core of the Times’ case against Hasidic schools is that they are failing to educate students.

The Times reported:

“Hasidic yeshivas, like all private schools in New York, are not required to administer state standardized tests in reading and math, and most do not. But some Hasidic schools give the exams as a condition of receiving public funding. In 2019, when nearly half of all New York students passed the tests, 99 percent of the thousands of Hasidic boys who took the exams failed, a Times analysis found.”

If true, this is very bad. Schools must teach English reading and writing, as well as math. But the Times’ sample may not be representative. The schools looking for extra public funding may not be interchangeable with the rest — indeed, it would be surprising if they were. Furthermore, as the Times eventually informed its readers, there is “no unified Hasidic school system. More than a dozen Hasidic groups each run their own schools.”

The Times’ writers use anecdotes, not data, to argue that the known bad yeshivas, rather than the positive examples they cite, are typical of the rest.

Perhaps these writers are right about this, and maybe almost all yeshivas really are failing their students, but their determination to extrapolate well beyond their evidence is troubling. The decision to go after yeshivas, in general, seems to have been driven by activism. The Times’ story was immediately seized on by politicians and was published just days before the state board of regents voted to impose new regulations on private schools.

This coordinated campaign against these yeshivas’ educational quality also stands out because of the dismal performance of many New York public schools. The districts of Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse are particular disasters, all with fewer than than 1 in 4 students managing proficiency in English and math (in some cases, barely 1 in 10). And these numbers are from 2019 before New York schools were closed in response to Covid-19 — and stayed closed long after we knew that children are at minimal risk from the disease.

Oddly enough, many of the paper’s complaints have echoes of conservative arguments about the importance of English in schools and the pitfalls of welfare. If the Times is worried that Hasidic yeshivas are gaming the system to maximize government benefits, wait until its reporters discover the rest of the welfare state.

But at the heart of the matter is the rights of minority communities to live peaceably out of step with the majority. And on this point, the Times’ editorial board gives the game away, arguing for a plan under which the government “allows private schools to operate only when local school boards find that their level of instruction is at least equal to that of local public schools.” Empowering the people who run local public schools to shut down their competition is a very bad idea and goes far beyond what is necessary to ensure that schools are teaching essential subjects such as English and math. That power will be used against religious dissenters.

Thus, we all need to learn from this coordinated attack on yeshivas because we are next. Christian schools and Christian homeschoolers, who both tend to have higher test scores, may not be as vulnerable to charges of academic failure, but this campaign is not just about basic standards for reading, writing, and arithmetic. The education establishment has been taken over by activists pushing radical sex, race, and gender ideologies, and they are eager to suppress political and religious nonconformists. They are starting with the Jewish schools, but it is a very short road from there to all religious and private schools.

Look at what leftist educators are already doing in the institutions under their control. They have made LGBT ideology and the narratives of the 1619 project into official dogmas. They are confusing elementary school kids about sex and sexuality, helping them transition without parental consent, and teaching children racial essentialism, which makes kids hate themselves and their peers. American universities are even increasingly requiring diversity statements (which is to say, loyalty oaths to leftist ideology) as part of the hiring process.

And the left is coming for the rest of us. For example, Yeshiva University is fighting in court against efforts to force it to violate its religious beliefs and officially recognize an LGBT student group. And the Biden administration is trying to force Christian colleges to put men in women’s dorm rooms and showers.

In this context, the Times’ campaign against Hasidic yeshivas is about much more than teaching math and English. It is a template for how they’re going to attack all dissenters — Jews, Christians, and anyone else — from their new secular orthodoxy.

Attacks On Jews Could Come To Your House Of Worship Next,"The war on religion has reached my front door.

My Chassidic Jewish community in Brooklyn is confronted with an unprecedented level of hostility. Hate crimes abound. Chassidic Jews have been shot at, punched, kicked, violently shoved, or almost run over. During Covid, politicians prohibited our community from coming together to pray, celebrate, and mourn — even when masked and distanced — while permitting and even joining public protests. And now they are coming for our children.

The latest attack comes from The New York Times. On Sept. 11, the Times published a report of its year-long “investigation” into the crown jewel of our community, our education system. Despite the report’s thin trappings of investigative journalism, the charge — plainly stated — was that Chassidic-Americans are too corrupt, abusive of children, and illiterate to be treated as equal members of society.

The Times fired another salvo on Sept. 16, arguing essentially for vesting extraordinary authority in state government and local school boards to “protect” our children from our “failing” schools and better prepare them for the future. Oy!

I fear they have a very different vision for my children’s future than my wife and I do.

I am a retired partner at a global elite law firm and had the honor of serving as an assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. My wife is a medical professional. We choose Chassidic yeshiva education for our children in Brooklyn, even at great family and financial sacrifice — commuting weekly to Washington, D.C., while serving at Treasury — because we are committed to, and did not wish to disrupt, an education that provides critical textual analysis applied to a broad and balanced curriculum infused with good values and optimism.

When you compare the harmony and hope in yeshiva schools to the public school landscape of drugs, alcohol, depression, suicide, violence, dismal literacy rates, and despair, our choice was easy.

Gratuitous Negativity and Inaccuracy

Rather than feature even one story of success within our system, the Times chose to push a dehumanizing narrative of ethnic stereotyping. Its 275 interviews over more than a year did not yield even one single voice among the tens of thousands of families touched by our yeshivas in profoundly positive ways.

It is relatively simple to dismantle the Times’ house-of-cards case against our yeshiva school system. First, it claims our schools provide a poor education. Test scores, graduate success, and the parents of roughly 100,000 students in more than 250 schools say differently. Unlike most public schools, where grade inflation runs rampant and roughly 25 percent of graduates are functionally illiterate, our system delivers a high rate of academic success, with most alumni committed to life-long learning.

Next, it claims the yeshiva system delivers this sub-standard education while bilking the state of New York out of millions, even billions of dollars. Rubbish. Yeshiva parents fund our system with more than $1 billion annually in private funds — on top of the taxes we pay to fund the public school system used by our fellow New Yorkers. In reality, the yeshiva system saves New York taxpayers hundreds of millions each year, receiving far less per pupil than public school students. Our students only receive a fraction of the more than $30,000 per student spent in New York City public schools and nearly all of it is earmarked for mandated services or things like busing or federally funded lunch programs that are available to all students.

Finally, the Times alleges that we are bad parents who insist on an education that traps our children in “a cycle of joblessness and destitution.” Nothing could be further from the truth. There are mountains of studies and statistics (ignored by the Times) showing higher incomes and monetary achievement for our students compared with their public school counterparts. Much more importantly, there is voluminous compelling evidence of longer lifespans and higher contentment and peace in our community.

Our detractors focus on poverty rates (rather than actual income) and eligibility for Section 8 housing or Medicaid benefits. But eligibility is often a direct result of Chasidim who typically marry at young ages and have larger families, so families may receive benefits during the years they have young children at home even when earning more than $75,000. “Fixing” their education won’t change the results, because it didn’t cause the problem.

Opting for Varied Curriculum

Our children’s yeshiva curriculum is based on the sacred texts of our religion and our people — the Talmud, Scripture, the Code of Jewish Law, and the vast scholarly and legal literature of Judaism. The subject matter covered is not exclusively religious and ranges from the esoteric to the mundane, covering a wealth of subjects in the humanities and sciences. This is precisely what we as parents want for our kids.

Success in our school system is high, but not easy. In addition to the intellectual and devotional elements of our curriculum, students must master numerous languages. My sons were fluent in English, Hebrew, Yiddish, and Aramaic by the time they completed elementary school. Granted, Aramaic may be useless if you’re standing on East 66th Street trying to get directions to the Hamptons, but, for a different group of travelers seeking a view of heaven, it’s the ticket.

As “the people of the Book,” Jews revere a lifetime of learning, study, and debate. What other group has hundreds of thousands of members — ranging from bus drivers to plumbers to doctors, lawyers, and billionaires, many rising at pre-dawn hours to this end — dedicated to a seven-year study cycle of the Talmud, and then rents out MetLife Stadium to celebrate the study’s completion with a standing-room-only crowd nearing 100,000?

Anti-Religious Attack

The timing of the Times’ report was not coincidental. It was prominently placed in the Sunday edition just two days before the New York Board of Regents’ vote on its proposed “substantial equivalency” regulations, which represent an unprecedented and dangerous intrusion into the private school system of our Chassidic community and so many others.

The state education department, the Board of Regents, and local school authorities should not be empowered to impose draconian mandates on a school system they do not understand, against the interests of parents who are happy with the education this system provides and the values it promotes.

All schools can use improvement, and as a parent, I am always pushing my children’s schools to excel. But more government control of our children is the last thing our communities need. So here’s a better idea. New York’s Regents can go through the 2,711 folios of the Talmud, and the sources our children learn with hermeneutic rigor, and tell us what we’re missing. In return, our leading Chassidic educators can propose approaches to produce happier, balanced, focused, and academically successful public school students. The resulting dialogue would be far more productive than the unwarranted attacks on my community this week.

But I won’t hold my breath because this campaign isn’t about improving the education in Chassidic schools. It’s about promoting a narrative that casts people of faith as intolerant, ignorant, and uncivilized. In service of this anti-religion narrative, facts will be invented, statistics massaged, and enemies of the people conjured out of whole cloth. The Chassidic-American community is the target today, but expect these attacks to come soon to a church, mosque, synagogue, or meditation retreat near you.

Roberts Can't Be Bothered To Condemn Leftists' War On SCOTUS,"Following several landmark rulings during last year’s Supreme Court term, which included the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the upholding of Second Amendment rights, and an affirmation of constitutionally protected religious liberty, leftists throughout the country’s various institutions have been hard at work in their attempts to destroy the credibility of SCOTUS. But Chief Justice John Roberts, who has shown remarkable efficiency in targeting conservatives when he fears their critiques endanger his bench’s legitimacy, has been conspicuously silent as leftists declare open season on the institution of the Supreme Court.

Since the high court kicked off its 2022-23 term earlier this week, the corporate media have launched a barrage of attacks against the body’s Republican-appointed justices and are issuing warnings about potential future decisions that don’t fit their distorted view of reality. In the pages of New York Magazine, for instance, writer Ed Kilgore whines that the court’s 2021-22 term was “the most damaging” for “progressives” in “living memory,” and opined that this year’s term “will have multiple opportunities to further the idea that [SCOTUS is] little more than an extension of the Republican Party.”

“[T]here will be plenty of opportunities in the 2022–23 term for the right-wing majority that reversed Roe v. Wade to upset additional progressive precedents and carve out new areas of constitutional law that could strengthen privileges for white people, conservative Christians, private-property interests, and red-state lawmakers,” Kilgore writes.

Of course, any efforts to smear non-leftist entities by America’s propaganda press wouldn’t be complete without input from The Washington Post and The New York Times.

“Supreme Court, dogged by questions of legitimacy, is ready to resume,” a Thursday headline from the Post reads.

“The Supreme Court Isn’t Listening, and It’s No Secret Why,” a Saturday headline from the Times’ editorial board opines, with the writers hyperbolically claiming that “[a] court that does not keep [public] trust cannot perform its critical role in American government.”

The highly contentious issues scheduled to come before SCOTUS this term include affirmative action, federal immigration policy, “whether business owners can refuse services” to LGBT customers “based on religious liberty claims,” “[v]oter redistricting, and the discretion of state legislatures to create congressional election boundaries,” as well as others.

The Buck Stops with Joe Biden

The wave of open hostility towards SCOTUS, particularly over the court’s takedown of Roe‘s invented “right” to an abortion, isn’t exclusive to the country’s partisan press. Rather, it’s being spearheaded by President Joe Biden.

Since the June release of the court’s opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, Biden has routinely lambasted SCOTUS and has sought to undermine its legitimacy at every available opportunity. Beginning on June 24, the day Dobbs was released, Biden unleashed a series of attacks against the high court, saying that the “conservative majority of the Supreme Court” showed “how extreme it is” and “how far removed they are from the majority of this country.”

The court is taking the country down an “extreme and dangerous path,” he added.

Less than a week later on June 30, Biden proceeded to declare to the world while at a NATO summit in Spain that SCOTUS’s “outrageous behavior” in overturning Roe is “the one thing that has been destabilizing [the world].”

A day later on July 1, the president continued with attempts to further denigrate the high court, once again referring to it as an “extremist” institution during a virtual meeting with Democrat governors over abortion.

“I’m joined by a group of Democratic governors as we work closely to protect women’s rights after this tragic reversal of Roe v. Wade — a terrible, extreme decision, in my view, upending the lives and impacting on the health and safety of millions of women,” Biden said. “And I share the public outrage at this extremist Court that’s committed to moving America backwards with fewer rights, less autonomy, and politicians invading the most personal of decisions of not only women but we’ll find, if they expend — expand on this decision, men as well.”

Where’s John Roberts?

Despite Biden’s unprecedented wave of attacks against SCOTUS, the body’s chief justice, John Roberts, is nowhere to be found. While the George W. Bush appointee did issue remarks this past summer questioning “the connection between the opinions people disagree with and the legitimacy of the Supreme Court,” he has not explicitly condemned or addressed Biden’s attacks on the high court.

The same could not be said, however, when it came to responding to criticisms issued by former President Donald Trump of leftist judges engaged in political activism from the bench. Back in November 2018, the Republican president blasted a federal judge appointed by former President Barack Obama for blocking one of his administration’s immigration policies, saying that the ruling was “a disgrace.”

“Because every case, no matter where it is, they file it — practically, I mean practically — for all intents and purposes — they file it in what’s called the 9th Circuit. This was an Obama judge. And I’ll tell you what, it’s not going to happen like this anymore,” Trump said. “Everybody that wants to sue the United States, they file their case in — almost — they file their case in the 9th Circuit. And it means an automatic loss no matter what you do, no matter how good your case is.”

When asked for comment on the president’s remarks by the Associated Press, Roberts responded with a statement directly addressing Trump’s criticisms, saying that the judiciary does “not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges.”

“What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them,” Roberts said. “The independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.”

Unlike Biden’s, Trump’s comments didn’t call into question the credibility of the judiciary, let alone label the Obama appointee or the 9th Circuit as “extremist.” Moreover, Trump never went before the world’s leading nations and accused his own country’s judiciary of stripping rights from American citizens. So why the response from Roberts to Trump but not Biden?

While former colleagues of Roberts such as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz have indicated that the chief justice appears to “despise[] Donald Trump,” the double standard seems to fall in line with Roberts’ history of political activism on the high court. Whether it’s been his behind-the-scenes deal with leftist justices to save Obamacare or his ill-fated attempt to preserve Roe, Roberts has regularly demonstrated a willingness to forfeit the traditional principles of a judge in order to avoid negative coverage from the country’s corrupt, left-wing media.

As detailed in their bestselling book, “Justice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court,” for example, Federalist Editor-in-Chief Mollie Hemingway and President of the Judicial Crisis Network Carrie Severino note how Roberts “was uneasy with the prospect of the Court’s making such a major change” to Obamacare and “feared it would be blamed for the likely fallout in the insurance markets” if the court struck it down.

CBS News’ Jan Crawford has also reported similar findings, revealing that “Roberts pays attention to media coverage” and that “[a]s chief justice, he is keenly aware of his leadership role on the court” and “is sensitive to how the court is perceived by the public.”

While rebuking Trump offered no real threat of bad coverage from legacy media, a statement condemning Biden for his attacks on the court almost certainly would. Then again, maybe Roberts is just too busy identifying and punishing the Dobbs leaker — oh wait, he still hasn’t gotten around to that either.

Whatever the ultimate reason may be for his continued silence, Roberts’ double standard doesn’t bode well for the chief justice’s apparent bid to preserve SCOTUS’s long-term reputation. If he had any real interest in preserving the integrity of the institution he serves, Roberts should abandon his role as a politician and become the originalist judge the country needs him to be.

Media Declare War On Catholic Hospitals With Pro-Abortion Lies,"Since the leaking of the Supreme Court’s expected overturning of Roe v. Wade this spring, there has been a seemingly coordinated hostility toward any institutional or cultural opposition to abortion. There have been overt attacks on pregnancy resource centers and FBI raids of pro-lifers’ homes, but perhaps one of the largest, longest-standing pro-life institutions facing an increasing number of attacks from both the federal government and their allies in the corporate media is Catholic hospitals.

With more than 600 hospitals and 1,600 long-term care and other health facilities nationwide, Catholic health providers are a substantial part of the country’s health care infrastructure. One in seven hospital patients in the United States is treated in a Catholic facility, according to the Catholic Health Association. So for pro-abortion activists, undermining the legitimacy of Catholic health systems makes sense as an efficient and far-reaching target. Catholic hospitals, of course, reject the left’s favorite euphemism that abortion is “health care.”

The Seismic Effect of Section 1557

Although hostility toward Catholic health providers goes back years, one could argue it was just a few weeks after the Dobbs decision was handed down in July that the Biden administration sanctioned an all-out war. Biden’s Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced revised rules to implement Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that would force Catholic health providers to violate their religious beliefs by forcing them to perform abortions and wrongly named “gender-affirming” procedures.

The rule change would alter the definition of “discrimination on the basis of sex” to include “discrimination on the basis of pregnancy or related conditions” including “pregnancy termination.”

The effect of this rule change cannot be overstated considering how removing First Amendment rights and conscience protections from more than 5,000 hospitals across the country — often the only health care providers in rural and minority communities — would exacerbate the existing health care worker shortage. When the HHS comment period on the proposed rule change closed on Oct. 3, there were nearly 74,000 comments submitted.

Of course, the abortion industry immediately hopped on board. The same day as the HHS announcement, the nation’s largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood, not only celebrated the proposed rule change but insinuated that health providers such as Catholic hospitals are “systemic barriers.”

“Today’s undertaking will help people lead healthy lives, without fear of discrimination in how or where they seek care. This proposed rule is a critical step in protecting people who already face discrimination and systemic barriers to accessing health care,” a Planned Parenthood statement read.

The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and other Catholic organizations said the proposed rule change would force providers to violate their religious and moral convictions and “threaten our ability to carry out our healing ministries, and others’ to practice medicine.”

Enter Media Allies

Despite such a consequential rule change on the horizon, any media-driven conversation on its impact on religious health care workers and the patients they serve has been nearly non-existent. Instead, as we entered the fall and midterms inched around the corner, the pro-abortion corporate media outlets began publishing their own targeted, selective attacks on Catholic health providers — an obvious piggybacking on Democrats’ last-ditch effort to focus on the issue of abortion ahead of the election.

In September, The New York Times published several pieces in a series titled “Profits Over Patients,” stringing together an ominous narrative about nonprofit (i.e. Catholic) hospitals that “wring money out of patients.”

The irony is that being mission-based and focused on serving the poorest and most vulnerable communities, Catholic hospitals are among the least profitable, especially in the years since Covid. Providence, one of the country’s largest nonprofit hospital chains featured in the NYT’s series, has announced that with operating expenses up and revenue down 5 percent, it has lost $5.2 billion in the first half of this year. Bon Secours Health System, another one of the country’s largest Catholic hospital systems and a target of the Times, also reported operating losses in 2022.

Compare that to for-profit providers that get to cherry-pick their markets and patients, such as HCA Healthcare, which reported that its revenue increased over the first six months of 2022 compared to the first six months of 2021.

By October, The Washinton Post had delivered its own not-so-subtle smear campaign. By omitting inconvenient facts about Catholic hospital policies toward women experiencing pregnancy complications and relying on data from notoriously pro-abortion sources, reporters at The Washinton Post crafted a false narrative that Catholic hospitals are limiting “reproductive care.”

Lying by Omission

Let’s start with the inconvenient facts. The Washington Post report on hospitals “limiting care” places blame squarely on directives from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, which the Post says “prohibits treatment it deems ‘immoral,'” including abortion.

“Those policies can limit treatment options for obstetric care during miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies, particularly in the presence of a fetal heartbeat,” the reporters conclude.

The false equivalency of abortion to treatment for miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies is not just a talking point that has been used far and wide since the Dobbs ruling — it’s a flat-out lie. Abortion is the intentional taking of a human life, while the Catholic Church and Catholic hospitals have been very clear about the permissibility of procedures that save a mother’s life, even in complicated pregnancies and or miscarriages.

Mary Haddad, president and chief executive of the Catholic Health Association of the United States, writes that when a mother faces an urgent, life-threatening condition, “Catholic health clinicians provide medically indicated treatment, even if it poses a threat to the unborn child or might result in the unintended death of the child.”

Roger Severino, vice president of domestic policy at The Heritage Foundation and former director of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights, called The Washington Post’s false claims “infuriating.”

“How many times do they have to say it before these reporters do their basic homework and realize that that is actually not how these hospitals operate?” he told The Federalist. “They’re not going to find people who have ever been denied miscarriage treatment because it doesn’t happen to Catholic hospitals.”

Severino is right. The Post article offers no examples of this, despite teasing “limits” on “treatment options for miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies” in the story’s subhead. Instead, the bulk of the report focuses only on examples of women who were denied other “reproductive services” at Catholic hospitals such as IUDs.

Then there is the selective sourcing. Aside from asking hospital representatives to admit that Catholic doctrine affects care, which they have openly stated for 150 years, The Washington Post reporters seemingly go out of their way to cite only openly pro-abortion sources. They quote leftist researchers published in Contraception, a “reproductive health journal,” as well as the openly “liberal health advocacy organization Community Catalyst.”

The executive director of Community Catalyst, Emily Stewart, is a former vice president for Planned Parenthood. The Community Catalyst board chair, Katherine Villers, is a major Democrat donor. It’s no surprise Catalyst would see the market share of Catholic hospitals as a bad thing, as insinuated in the WaPo piece when it warns about the “erosion of care” thanks to the “growing dominance of Catholic hospitals.”

Between administrative attacks from DOJ to HHS and media smear campaigns, the widespread effort to vilify Catholic hospitals to appease the loudest radical abortion voices seems more than coincidental. While these attacks are consistently framed as though they’re predicated by “limits on care,” the truth is that the attempts to drive religious hospitals out of business would do more to end care of the mind, body, and soul for the patients who need it the most.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/10/21/pro-abortion-activists-and-media-propagandists-launch-all-out-war-on-catholic-hospitals/,2022-10-21
HBO's '38 At The Garden' Is A Lie Of Omission About Asian Hate,"HBO’s recently released documentary short “38 at the Garden” tells the story of “an undrafted Harvard graduate” who “shocked fans, stunned his teammates and galvanized the Asian American community when he scored 38 points at Madison Square Garden against the Los Angeles Lakers” in February 2012. Unfortunately, it also juxtaposes Jeremy Lin’s “stature as a groundbreaking, cultural icon” with “the recent hate crimes against … Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.”

With left-wing activist Lisa Ling as an executive producer, there wasn’t a chance that a retrospective on “Linsanity” wouldn’t be hopelessly woke. But that’s no reason to spare the execrable “38 at the Garden” a well-deserved bashing.

The spectacle starts immediately, as the incredibly unfunny comedians Hasan Minhaj and Jenny Yang explain what most Americans think about Asians with no reference to polling or focus-group findings. With his Emmy and Peabody awards visible over his right shoulder, Minhaj lectures that someone viewed as “small, passive, diminutive, unathletic, and submissive” cannot be perceived as “brave, courageous, covetable, desirable, or a leader.” Yang gets more specific and says Asians are viewed as “dry cleaners,” “IT guys,” “emasculated, no-d-ck-having, no-luck-with-women-having dudes,” “dragon lady,” “sex workers,” and “masseuses’ happy endings.”

Given that people of Asian descent in the United States outperform all other groups in socioeconomic metrics such as out-of-wedlock births, divorce rates, life expectancy, educational attainment, and household income, it’s at least theoretically possible that non-Asian Americans admire the cohort’s penchant for hard work, knowledge and skill cultivation, strong family and community ties, and clean living. Someone should inform Minhaj and Yang.

But it’s Lin himself who — unintentionally, one hopes — commits the documentary’s worst foul. Dutifully parroting the dubious charge that white supremacists are running amok, targeting BIPOCs, he asserts that today, “It’s like the worst time to be an Asian American.”

Really?

Worse than in 1942, when liberal icon Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, sending 120,000 Japanese people — the majority, U.S. citizens — off to internment camps?

Or worse than the myriad large-scale atrocities and hate crimes committed against Asians across the country in the 19th and 20th centuries?

Lin didn’t learn much about U.S. history at Harvard, evidently. The bias and brutality Asians had to overcome in past centuries is a testament to their undaunted tenacity and America’s national progress in putting prejudice in its rearview mirror.

Besides, the narrative of white supremacy posing a risk to Asian Americans has no credibility. Earlier this month, in a detailed analysis, the Manhattan Institute’s Diane Yap concluded: “The refrain that most anti-Asian crimes are committed by white people is misleading, if not meaningless.” Severe methodological defects and the corporate media’s laziness and knee-jerk receptivity to any accusation that the United States is irredeemably racist aid the woke mob’s “attempt to redirect outrage.”

Yap also noted that a focus on rare “hate crimes” ignores important questions:

A more pertinent question would be: “Who is responsible for the greatest proportion of violent crimes against Asians?” The Criminal Victimization report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics provides a robust dataset, with over 180,000 violent attacks on Asians in 2018. The data indicate just how misleading the narrative of white-on-Asian violence really is. While black perpetrators account for 27.5 percent of violent attacks against Asians, Asians commit less than 0.1 percent of violent attacks against blacks, indicating little role for proximity. Most violent attacks against individuals of a particular racial group are committed by other members of that group — except for Asians, where a plurality is committed by blacks. In fact, blacks are responsible for 305 percent more violent crime against Asians than neighborhood demographics would predict, while whites and Hispanics commit significantly fewer attacks against Asians than would be expected.

“38 at the Garden’s” fatal flaw is the sin of omission. A considerable aspect of why Asian Americans have a more challenging time as of late is because of discriminatory policies they face in higher education. These policies are so egregious that on Oct. 31, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in two cases that the Legal Insurrection Foundation believes “could end Affirmative Action as we know it.” Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College and Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. University of North Carolina will challenge policies that “are discriminatory against students of Asian descent.”

Rather than addressing genuine race-based problems, the practitioners of identity politics construct imaginary biases and phantom threats as they advocate for left-wing policy agendas. Anything — even a heartwarming tale about an out-of-nowhere basketball player who briefly captured the nation’s attention — can be used to push the agenda of cultural Marxism.

Jeremy Lin deserves better than “38 at the Garden.” Asian Americans do, too.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/10/24/hbos-38-at-the-garden-is-one-big-lie-of-omission-about-asian-hate/,2022-10-24
Rubio Canvasser Brutally Attacked While Campaigning For GOP,"A canvasser for Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., was reportedly assaulted Sunday night while supporting the re-election campaigns of the incumbent senator and the state’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.

“Last night one of our canvassers wearing my T-shirt and a DeSantis hat was brutally attacked by 4 animals who told him Republicans weren’t allowed in their neighborhood,” Rubio wrote on Twitter with photos of the victim, Christopher Monzon, who was canvassing in a Hialeah neighborhood of Miami-Dade County. “He suffered internal bleeding, a broken jaw & will need facial reconstructive surgery.”

Left-wing outlets such as the Daily Dot began to justify the attack over Monzon’s reported ties to political extremists.

“Marco Rubio shares tale of canvasser being attacked, omits that he’s a notorious local racist,” the outlet reported, burying a quote from Monzon in The New York Times this summer that he was on the “path to de-radicalization.”

Monzon had previously been called the “Cuban Confederate” and attended the 2017 Unite the Right rally. In 2018, however, Monzon said he quit the League of the South before the group embraced white supremacy and ran for the Hialeah City Council last year. During the campaign, Monzon told the Daily Dot he regretted using racial slurs to describe black and Jewish people.

“I do not condone the usage of such language,” Monzon said. “While I might have used the language in the past, I no longer believe that using those slurs is acceptable.”

Monzon lost the race but has remained a local activist working on behalf of Florida Republicans.

According to the Miami Herald on Monday, police arrested 25-year-old Javier Jesus Lopez over the attack. Lopez was charged with aggravated battery and causing great bodily harm, a second-degree felony.

“An arrest report, however, does not reference politics or suggest that the victim was attacked because of his political beliefs,” the local paper reported.

According to Lopez’s arrest affidavit, the victim was walking near 140 East 60th St. around 6:50 p.m. Sunday in a neighborhood just south of Amelia Earhart Park when Lopez — a Hialeah resident — stood in front of him to block access to the sidewalk. The canvasser crossed the street to avoid him, but police say Lopez responded, ‘You can’t pass by here, this is my neighborhood.’ An argument ensued and Lopez grabbed the victim and slammed him against the floor, the victim told police. A second man, who is not in custody, apparently kicked the victim’s face, as Lopez punched him repeatedly.

Paul Pelosi Had A Brush With Death. Here’s Why We’re Not Crying,"Democrats and their little media friends are beside themselves that right-wingers aren’t in mourning over the very strange — shut up, don’t ask! — attack on Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband. They’ve all seemed to have forgotten how they treated everyone over the past three years.

To recap, 82-year-old Paul Pelosi was hospitalized last week after a man in his house attacked him with a hammer. At this point, that is literally the only thing that everyone agrees happened, since the story keeps changing. To wit, NBC’s “Today” aired a segment Friday morning billed as an “exclusive” with “new details” about the assault. And then NBC deleted the segment from its website and from its Twitter account, claiming that, “The piece should not have aired because it did not meet NBC News reporting standards.”

Setting aside the ever-changing kinky details of the affair, it’s been interesting to watch liberals in the days since whine about Republicans and conservative media being insufficiently concerned with Pelosi’s wellbeing, even accusing them of spreading “conspiracy theories” about the attack.

Jamelle Bouie captured it all at the top of his column in Friday’s New York Times: “[I]t has been shocking to watch Republican politicians and conservative media personalities respond to the brutal attack on Paul Pelosi … with lies, conspiracy mongering and gleeful disregard for the victim.”

Let’s talk about compassion for the victims of deadly encounters. For three years now, Democrats and the corrupt national media have blamed every single infection, hospitalization, and death of an airborne virus on people who were guilty of nothing more than minding their own business.

Herman Cain, the former businessman who ran for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012, attended a Trump campaign rally in June 2020. He died a month later from Covid-related complications. Here’s how the media reacted to that story:

“Herman Cain, ex-presidential candidate who refused to wear mask, dies after COVID-19 diagnosis.”— Reuters

“Cain, who co-chaired Black Voices for Trump, was photographed maskless and not socially distancing at the event.”— The Washington Post

“He was photographed there inside the arena without a mask sitting with a group of other Trump campaign surrogates.”— ABC News

“A photo taken at the rally showed Cain, without a mask, sitting closely to other people who also were not wearing any face coverings.”— Associated Press

No less than the president of the United States contracted an infection that is, by every indication, unstoppable. The New York Times captured the history by observing that, “Even if Mr. Trump does not become seriously ill, the positive test could prove devastating to his political fortunes,” because he had “scorned the advice of scientists,” and “refused to wear a mask in public.”

Nancy Pelosi herself said of Trump that “Going into crowds unmasked and all the rest was sort of a brazen invitation for something like this to happen.” (Perhaps living in a sanctuary city like San Francisco that might allow an illegal immigrant to roam the streets on the hunt for criminal activity would be “sort of a brazen invitation” for something like the attack on Pelosi. But we won’t say that.)

When the president recovered from his severe illness, advising the public in an innocuous tweet to live without fear, CNN’s Jake Tapper lifted his droopy eyelids in disgust. “It’s OK to be afraid of Covid, and it’s OK that it’s dominating your life,” he whined. He also called Trump’s tweet “so disrespectful.”

After that — months and months of being blamed for the spread of an uncontrollable virus –right-wingers are expected to film themselves praying for the Pelosis? No thanks! (Though we will say a prayer, maybe two, in private.)

They can get lost. Bouie’s Times piece went on about how important “virtue” is in a healthy republic. True, but the responsibility of saying, “Well, let’s put politics aside for now” isn’t going to be for one side only. Other than 9/11, there was never a more important time in the past half-century to “put politics aside” than in March of 2020, when the nation was told that a mysterious and deadly pathogen was sweeping across the globe.

Instead of giving “the resistance” a rest, Democrats and the media thought to themselves, Now’s our chance! They blamed Republicans for getting people sick. They blamed Republicans for getting themselves sick. If a Republican got infected, it was his own fault for not getting vaccinated. If a Democrat fell ill, it was a Republican’s fault for not wearing a mask. Miraculously, Democrats were never held responsible for any disease spread, despite virtually every party leader being photographed without masks and gathering with others.

It’s too bad. Four years ago, everyone would be deeply concerned about the spouse of a political leader having his head battered with a hammer. Yes, even if the circumstances seemed a little lewd and indecent. (Shhh!)

It is sad. But conjuring up the energy for much compassion, after what they’ve put us through, is just too difficult. Best of luck to the Pelosis, though.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/11/05/paul-pelosi-had-a-brush-with-death-heres-why-were-not-crying/,2022-11-05
Candace Cameron Bure Reacts To Haters By Sharing The Gospel,"Candace Cameron Bure, the Hallmark Channel queen who rose to fame as D.J. Tanner on “Full House,” just wants to make Christmas movies that spread the joy and wholesomeness of Christmas and of her Christian faith. To that end, she recently moved from Hallmark to Great American Family, a new, smaller channel “that is positioning itself as the God-and-country alternative for holiday entertainment.”

For the crime of wanting to make a product that aligns better with her Christian faith, Bure is getting slammed as a bigot. But instead of apologizing for her convictions, Bure’s words and actions indicate she’s more interested in spreading the love of Christ than appeasing her Hollywood haters.

“My heart wants to tell stories that have more meaning and purpose and depth behind them,” Bure told The Wall Street Journal in a feature story that set off a firestorm of backlash on Monday. “I knew that the people behind Great American Family were Christians that love the Lord and wanted to promote faith programming and good family entertainment.”

The channel isn’t designed to “proselytize” or tell overtly religious stories, but to provide itself as an alternative for Americans who are fed up with the incessant agendas of mainstream Hollywood, suggested Bill Abbott, the former CEO of Hallmark’s parent company who is now heading up Great American Media, which includes Great American Family. Prompted by a question about whether same-sex relationships will be central features of her films, Bure said in her interview with the Journal, “I think that Great American Family will keep traditional marriage at the core.”

For that line, Bure was chastised by former Hallmark colleagues and other fellow stars from JoJo Siwa to Maren Morris, Chrishell Stause, and even Bure’s former “Full House” costar Jodie Sweetin, who commented her support for Siwa’s post slamming Bure.

The Real Christmas Story

Instead of caving to her critics and apologizing for her faith, Bure used her response on Thursday as an opportunity to share the Gospel story for which Christmas exists in the first place.

“I am a devoted Christian. Which means that I believe that every human being bears the image of God,” she wrote on Instagram. “Because of that, I am called to love all people, and I do.”

“In everything I do and say,” she continued, “God’s love and God’s compassion is front and center. All of that comes from the LOVE that God himself showered upon humanity when he gave the gift of joy and forgiveness on the first Christmas morning 2000 years ago.”

Without apologizing for her Christian beliefs, Bure said it “breaks my heart that anyone would ever think I intentionally would want to offend and hurt anyone.” She also indicated that, while she won’t use her movies to promote an agenda that undermines traditional marriage, her beliefs do not preclude her from loving and working alongside people whose lifestyles she may not condone (this same distinction has been made by Jack Phillips, another Christian targeted for his convictions). “I had also expressed in my interview, which was not included, that people of all ethnicities and identities have and will continue to contribute to the network in great ways both in front of and behind the camera, which I encourage and fully support,” Bure said.

“I have a simple message: I love you anyway,” she wrote to the media fanning “flames of conflict,” to her online bullies, and to “everyone reading this.”

Appeasement Won’t Save You

Bure understands that men and women are different, that their differences complement each other beautifully and intentionally in marriage to the benefit of each other and their families, and that healthy families are the backbone of a healthy society. But even if you disagree with her premise, she’s acted on it in a way that any consistent “tolerance” police couldn’t find fault with.

She’s not demanding Hallmark stop featuring LGBT-centric plotlines or forcing anyone to watch her new movies. She’s doing exactly what the left-leaning elites who control institutions from Hollywood to media to Big Tech have told conservatives to do when they disagree with the ideologies of those institutions: Build your own! Regardless of whether that’s a sustainable approach for conservatives — the flak people like Bure receive suggests it may not be, but that’s a different discussion — she’s not asking for anything but the freedom to make joyful Christmas movies that don’t contradict her values and convictions.

But that’s not enough for Hollywood bullies, who don’t just want to advance their own views on the biggest networks and peacefully coexist with people who have different values and perspectives; they want to make Bure and every other free thinker actively advance left-wing views, too. By peacefully joining a different channel, Bure wasn’t proving her “allyship” with their agenda enough — even though she declined to criticize Hallmark in her interview with the Journal, simply saying a “change of leadership” has made it “a completely different network than when I started.”

Good on Candace Cameron Bure for refusing to promote messages that run counter to her faith, and for responding to attacks with grace instead of groveling. Even more so, good on her for taking the attention those attacks garnered and using it to spread the message of God’s love for mankind.

That’s a Christmas story you don’t have to be a Hallmark movie buff to enjoy.

"After Feds Ignore Attacks, Pro-Lifers Take Up Private Investigations","Last June, a firebomb ripped through the CompassCare crisis pregnancy center in Buffalo, causing extensive damage but no deaths. Amid the rubble and soot, the words “Jane was here” were written on the wall, suggesting that the militant abortion rights group Jane’s Revenge was responsible. Almost immediately, authorities all the way up to the FBI assured the pro-life enterprise they would bring the perpetrators to justice.

Eight months later, CompassCare officials say nothing has happened. Nor have any arrests been made in any of the scores of similar attacks that have damaged other crisis pregnancy counseling offices and churches coast to coast since word first leaked in late May that the Supreme Court would overturn Roe v. Wade, returning abortion laws to state legislatures.

CompassCare CEO Jim Harden says this inaction has forced the pro-life movement to do the work of law enforcement on its own. His organization has teamed with the Thomas More Society, a nonprofit libertarian law firm in Chicago, to hire their own private investigators. The home of the firm’s president, Thomas Brejcha, was damaged by abortion supporters last July.

Neither the Thomas More Society nor CompassCare elaborated on the private investigators hired to look at the attacks by abortion supporters — who they are, how many, or where deployed. But Brejcha said no price limit has been put on their services.

The development comes at a time when many, especially on the right, are warning of the politicization of justice. A few of the examples they point to are the SWAT team arrest of Trump adviser Roger Stone; the armed search of former president Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home in pursuit of classified documents (along with the multiple lawsuits specifically aimed at Trump); and Attorney General Merrick Garland’s ordering the FBI to track possible threats of violence or intimidation after parents began confronting school boards about what their children were being taught in public schools.

They say such heavy-handedness contrasts with law enforcement at the local, state, and federal levels turning a blind eye to obvious lawlessness not identified with the right. Examples include the nationwide George Floyd riots of 2020; smash-and-grab thefts at retail stores from New York to Los Angeles; homeless camps turned open-air drug bazaars; and city prosecutors declining to enforce laws because of concerns regarding “systemic racism.”

“I think the country’s gone bonkers,” Brejcha said. “We watched rioters looting in the south side of Chicago, where I grew up. I think what we’re doing is a normal response. It’s not vigilante, but citizens taking civic action.”

Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told RealClearInvestigations: “I’m not surprised pro-life groups have had to conduct their own investigations after being attacked by radical abortion activists. Sadly, they’ve been left with no other option because of the blatant politicization of the Biden FBI and the Justice Department.”

Abortion opponents are doubly incensed by what they consider aggressive action by the Department of Justice against them. They, along with several Republican members of Congress, accuse the department of one-sided enforcement of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act, a 1994 law that prohibits “violent, threatening, damaging, and obstructive conduct intended to injure, intimidate, or interfere with the right to seek, obtain, or provide reproductive health services.”

The Justice Department pursued dozens of anti-abortion activists in multiple states on FACE Act charges last year, chiefly for alleged offenses in previous years, according to its website. In October, federal prosecutors indicted 11 people in Tennessee, including an 87-year-old survivor of a Communist concentration camp, for alleged actions stemming from a 2021 incident. Another incident outside a Washington, D.C. abortion facility in 2020 led to 10 more indictments in March and October of 2022.

Abortion opponents note that, in contrast, federal officials have failed to make a single arrest in what the Thomas More Society counts as 161 attacks on pro-lifers since the leak of the Supreme Court draft decision last May. In addition to the CompassCare attack in Buffalo, these include actions against pregnancy crisis centers in Washington, D.C., and Oregon, as well as Brejcha’s home in Evanston, Illinois (unoccupied at the time). Federal prosecutors have made a cause célèbre out of Mark Houck, a longtime anti-abortion activist and father of seven who was arrested in an FBI raid on his Pennsylvania home last September and now faces a Jan. 24 court date for alleged FACE violations.

Houck’s case stems from an incident outside a Philadelphia abortion facility in October 2021. Houck and an abortion supporter tangled outside the clinic, with Houck claiming he was defending his son. Local police were called to the scene and declined action; a court complaint against Houck was dismissed when no one appeared to press the case.

Nevertheless, months later the Justice Department took up the case. He was arrested at his Pennsylvania home by armed state and federal agents last September and charged with two FACE Act violations involving the alleged shoving incidents. He faces up to 11 years in prison. Thomas More Society lawyers are defending Houck, and they filed motions last month to dismiss the case, calling the FACE Act unconstitutional and accusing the Biden administration of “viewpoint discrimination” and “selective prosecution.”

The FBI insists its agents have remained impartial.

But anti-abortion activists say the bureau’s claims are undermined by their own admissions. FBI Director Christopher Wray acknowledged in congressional testimony last November “that, since the Dobbs Act decision, probably in the neighborhood of 70 percent of our abortion-related violence cases or threats cases are cases of violence or threats against pro-life, the victims are pro-life organizations.”

Asked repeatedly whether any arrest had been made in these cases, the FBI declined to comment. On Jan. 19, the day after RCI’s most recent request for arrest data, the bureau reissued its November announcement of rewards up to $25,000 for information that leads to an arrest in nine more attacks against abortion opponents in addition to the Buffalo firebombing.

“The FBI is continuing to investigate a series of attacks and threats targeting pregnancy resource centers, faith-based organizations, and reproductive health clinics across the country, as well as to judicial buildings, including the U.S. Supreme Court,” a spokesman said. “The incidents are being investigated as potential acts of domestic violent extremism, FACE Act violations, or violent crime matters, depending on the facts of each case.”

Harden of CompassCare called the rewards a publicity stunt that reflects “feigned interest” by the Justice Department and said perhaps the investigators hired by CompassCare and the Thomas More Society could get their own investigatory work “underwritten by the reward money.”

Harden said the reward money “makes FBI Director Wray look like the hero absent results,” Harden said. “It’s a day late and a dollar short.”

The FBI took CompassCare’s security video from the night of the attack and has refused to return it, and Harden said when he called last June to get an idea of any progress in the investigation, agents told him: “We don’t answer to you. We’re not answering any of your questions.”

It was only last August, after Sen. Cruz criticized the Justice Department for politicizing its activity and accused it of neglecting the attacks on anti-abortion figures, that the FBI called and requested a meeting. There, the FBI tried to buy his silence, according to Harden.

“They said, ‘If you back off we’ll give this more attention,’” he recalled. “Now they know they’ll be under scrutiny from the House Judiciary Committee,” — a reference to the Republican takeover of the U.S. House of Representatives this year.

Like Harden, Brejcha said he has not seen any progress into the investigation of the vandalism of his house last July, despite a seemingly large number of leads. The demonstration at his house was advertised on social media and printed on flyers. Protesters drove to a nearby park before marching to Brejcha’s house where the black-clad and masked activists tore out bushes, spray-painted the house, and tossed smoke bombs and paint bombs at it. No one was injured in the incident.

Brejcha said videotape showed the protesters gathering in the park, and car license plates of protesters are available to investigators. But in the face of such evidence, he says, he does not believe a good-faith effort has been made by police. A spokesman for the Evanston, Ill., police department confirmed to RCI last week there have been no arrests.

“The police told me they’d been tipped by the FBI that they would be targeting my house the next day,” Brejcha said. “That’s a threat.”

Brejcha said he did “not want to attack the police, but they need to be more aggressive. There are so many connections between all these events.”

Hans von Spakovsky, a conservative attorney, told RCI he wasn’t surprised that abortion opponents felt compelled to hire their own investigative staff given the lack of attention they’ve received as victims.

“It is another shocking development that victims of violent attacks and harassment can’t trust the FBI to actually investigate their case or the Justice Department to prosecute it,” he said. “It is even more evidence of the politicization of federal law enforcement, one of the most dangerous developments in modern times.”

Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan sent a letter to Garland just before the November midterms demanding the preservation of documents and promising that “one-sided enforcement of the FACE act” would be among politicized moves his House Judiciary Committee would investigate.

Outside of the abortion battles, some of those who feel similarly betrayed by authorities wish they, too, could hire their own police. In Phoenix, for instance, people have fought with city officials for months over “The Zone,” a growing homeless encampment where a charred fetus was found last November and a burned man in December.

“I’d love to get private security here but who can afford it?” said Angela Ojile, who owns an antique store across the street from “The Zone” and its estimated 1,000 people. “I know the police have been told to stand down, and now they’ve created a dangerous situation.”

Ojile described a nightmarish situation in which drug dealing, public defecation, and a threatening atmosphere overwhelm her, anyone she can convince to work in the store, and potential customers.

“There’s some scary people down there and I can’t keep employees,” she said. “They’re so petrified because people are getting beat up, held up, there’s people running around half naked over there.”

“The Zone,” like the abortion battles, has spawned litigation. On one hand, the Goldwater Institute, a conservative Arizona-based think tank, has thrown its support behind a lawsuit that accuses Phoenix authorities of betraying the public trust. A spate of violent crimes including shootings, stabbings, and rape have made “The Zone” a perverse example of compassion run amok.

“It’s just lawless,” the Institute’s Austin Vanderheyden told RCI. “The city in its inaction has caused this.”

Phoenix has launched some small-scale clean-up operations but those have come under legal attack by the ACLU, which sued the city in part to block the removal of temporary shelters in “The Zone.”

At both the federal and local level in these cases, the argument is the same: that officials have made law enforcement decisions based on politics.

“It’s a hard word to talk about the ‘politicization’ of the Justice Department, but there seems to be too much tolerance on one side of the political equation,” Brejcha said.

Harden said the decisions within the Justice Department that appear to green-light aggressive prosecution of abortion opponents while overlooking attacks by abortion supporters leave groups and individuals with no choice but to move outside traditional law enforcement channels.

“This signals to me a breach of contract between the government and the people,” he said. “Civilized order depends on people’s trust that criminals will at least be pursued in good faith. But when they refuse to investigate crimes equally, their corruption becomes complete and they become complicit in the crimes themselves.”

Addendum: After requests to the FBI for comment before RCI’s publication deadline, the bureau responded post-publication:

The FBI takes all allegations of misconduct seriously and reports them to the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General. Contrary to the inference, the FBI has continued to rigorously investigate the arson of the CompassCare facility and will continue to do so. On January 19, the FBI began offering up to a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the persons responsible for the arson.

False Stats Fly As California Democrats Push For Gun Control,"After Friday’s mass public shooting in Israel that left seven people dead, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced: “Firearm licensing will be expedited and expanded in order to enable thousands of additional citizens to carry weapons.”

By contrast, after the three public shootings over the last two weekends in California, the verdict from Democrats is that we need even more gun control laws. President Joe Biden and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., used the attacks to call for a renewed federal assault weapons ban. California’s other Democrat senator, Alex Padilla, called for expanded federal background checks on gun purchases.

California already has the strictest gun control laws in the country, and it has both of those laws and many more. In contrast to Israel and almost all the rest of the United States, concealed handgun permits have been almost impossible to get in the counties where California’s attacks occurred. In Los Angeles County, where two of the attacks occurred, there is only one permit for every 5,660 adults. In San Mateo County, where another attack occurred, there is one permit per every 24,630 adults. By contrast, in the 43 right-to-carry states, there is one permit holder for every nine people.

When Americans are allowed to carry permitted concealed handguns, they stop about half the active shooting attacks in the U.S.

Evaluating the Current Approach

Before doubling down on yet more gun control and making the rest of the country like California, let’s first ask ourselves how the current approach has worked out. Even some Democrats in California are calling for a re-evaluation.

“California has some of the strictest gun control laws in the country, but look at what we just had today,” Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna acknowledged after the Monterey Park attack. “I can tell you this — the status quo is not working. We need to re-examine what we are doing, and what may work better.”

However, most other Democrats are unwilling to concede that their laws aren’t working. On Saturday, Biden tweeted the claim he has often made: “In the 10 years that the assault weapons ban was on the books, mass shootings went down.” But there was no drop in the number of attacks using so-called assault weapons during the 1994 to 2004 ban. More importantly, if the ban made a difference, we should see a drop in the percentage of attacks with assault weapons during the federal ban period and then an increase in the post-ban period, but the exact opposite is true. You can’t have the ban reducing the number of attacks without the share of attacks using assault weapons falling.

California’s Laws

In 2021, when federal Judge Roger Benitez struck down California’s “assault weapons” ban, he concluded that the state’s experts, who summarized the existing research, could not provide any evidence that the prohibition reduced any type of violent crime.

Last year, California Gov. Gavin Newsom put out a fact sheet purporting to prove “California’s Gun Safety Policies Save Lives, Provide Model for a Nation Seeking Solutions.”

According to the report: “From 1993 to 2017, California’s firearm mortality rate declined by 55 percent — almost four times the decrease in the rest of the nation. Many of California’s most important firearm laws went into effect in the early 1990s.”

California’s murder rate peaked in 1993 at 13.1 per 100,000 people. That’s up from 10.9 in 1989, the year before the state’s assault weapons ban went into effect.

Why did the murder rate fall by 10 percent in 1994 and not in 1990 and continue falling by 53 percent by 2000? California’s tough three-strikes criminal punishment law went into effect on March 7, 1994.

The Newsom fact sheet also quotes the Public Policy Institute of California: “Compared to citizens of other states, Californians are about 25% less likely to die in mass shootings. Between 2019 and 2021, the state’s annual mass shooting homicide rate of 1.4 per one million people was lower than the national average of 1.9.”

After the California Supreme Court declared the state’s assault weapons ban unconstitutional in 1998, a new version was enacted in 2000. Picking just a few years from 2019 to 2021 to evaluate the law seems arbitrary. Whether one picks the years from 2000 on, 2010 on, or 2020 on, the per capita rate of mass public shootings in California is always greater than the rate for the rest of the country.

The rate has also been consistently lower in Texas, to which gun control groups give an “F” grade for its gun control laws. From 2010 on, California’s per capita rate of mass public shootings was 43 percent higher than the rate in Texas and 29 percent higher than in the rest of the United States. Since 2020, the rate in California was 276 percent higher than in Texas and 100 percent higher than in the rest of the U.S.

Last summer, after the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, billboards in Los Angeles and San Francisco tried to warn Californians of the danger of mass public shootings in Texas. The idea was to dissuade people from moving. But if that is what concerns Californians, they would be well advised to leave their own state as soon as possible.

Los Angeles County Sheriff Luna is right that California’s gun control laws aren’t working. The last thing we should do is use California’s set of laws as the model for the rest of the country.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/02/02/false-statistics-fly-as-california-democrats-push-for-gun-control-laws-that-failed-already/,2023-02-02
"No, Biden’s Push For Red-Flag Laws Won’t Keep Anyone Safer","If a person is really a danger to himself or others, confiscating guns isn’t much of a solution. There are so many other ways for disturbed people to cause harm. But advocates of “red flag” laws want people to believe that simply taking away someone’s legally-owned guns means the problem is solved.

Last week, the Biden administration announced it was using part of the $1.8 trillion massive spending bill passed after last year’s election to give $231 million to states that enact red-flag laws and push other gun-control policies. After last week’s mass public shooting at Michigan State University, gun-control advocates from Michael Bloomberg’s Moms Demand Action were again touting red-flag laws as the solution. Michigan legislators also see the attack as a chance to pass the law.

The law doesn’t respect the right to due process. Judges take away a person’s guns without a hearing based on only a mere written complaint. But the laws also don’t even make people safer.

It’s easy enough for people to do something crazy with a motor vehicle, but none of the red-flag laws address taking away a person’s ability to drive. Last week, a 62-year-old man ran over people with a U-Haul truck on a Brooklyn sidewalk, killing one and injuring eight others. The man was described as having had a mental health crisis.

Until 2018, the Crime Prevention Research Center tried keeping a list of vehicle attacks worldwide. The worst recent vehicle attack occurred in France on July 14, 2016, when 86 were killed and 430 wounded. That attack was much more deadly than any American mass public shooting. In Western Europe, only the November 2015 Paris concert attack was more deadly.

There have been more vehicle attacks in the past few years. In November 2021, a 38-year-old man who was already facing felony charges for attempting to kill the mother of his child with his car murdered six and injured 62 others with that same vehicle at a Waukesha Christmas parade.

In November 2022, Florida police narrowly averted a “mass casualty” event at a 5K Thanksgiving Day run by stopping a woman before she could drive her Range Rover through the crowd at 60 mph. Once caught, the disturbed woman “repeatedly banged her head” against the window of a police car.

The Washington Post notes that between May and June 2020, there were at least 18 deliberate vehicles rammings into people.

The MSU killer suspect, Anthony McRae, also had a history of mental illness. Police even performed a welfare check on him just the week before the attack. But if the police had a “reasonable belief” that McRae posed a danger to himself or others, they already had the authority to have him evaluated under Michigan’s involuntary commitment law. If mental health professionals concurred about McRae posing a danger, there would have been an immediate hearing and a lawyer provided for his defense.

While judges can involuntarily commit individuals, they also have a broad range of other options, such as voluntary mental health treatment with a follow-up hearing or taking away a person’s guns.

Red-flag laws start with the same “reasonableness” test but don’t give people a hearing and have no mental health care experts involved in the process. The judge is only given the power to confiscate a person’s legally-owned guns.

The same reasonableness standard applies to both red-flag laws and involuntary commitment. And the police didn’t think McRae met that standard, so a red-flag law wouldn’t have prevented this attack.

As to using red-flag laws to prevent suicides, about half of suicides do indeed involve guns, but there are lots of other lethal methods (e.g., hanging, cyanide, walking in front of a train or bus, jumping from a lethal height). When all firearms are banned, the suicide rates remain statistically unchanged as people simply switch to other ways of killing themselves.

A frequent claim is that red-flag laws are very popular. But when surveys explain that guns are taken away without a hearing and that no mental health professionals are involved, voters change from 2-to-1 support to almost 2-to-1 opposition.

If a person is actually dangerous, he has so many other ways to commit suicide or kill others. It is no wonder research shows red-flag laws to be ineffective.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/02/22/no-bidens-push-for-red-flag-laws-wont-keep-anyone-safer/,2023-02-22
