Youth Rights: A Trojan Horse for the Left’s Sexual Agenda,"Once again, a liberal promoting the Democrat education agenda has asserted that, “[t]he children,” as in yours and mine, “belong to all of us.” This time it was Professor Paul Reville, former Massachusetts Secretary of Education, who recently defended the controversial Common Core Curriculum with an appeal to shared concern for ‘our’ children. Awhile back, it was MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry who urged more education spending because “kids belong to whole communities,” not to their parents.

Such talk raises the hackles—and the suspicions—of conservatives. They see progressives as hell-bent on an agenda to restructure the American family. And they worry that liberal activists will mold the next generation in tolerance, autonomy, and moral relativism, while teaching them to reject parental authority and religious values.

There’s reason to worry.

But the real threat comes not from pundits and their puffery over ‘who owns the kids,’ but from the Trojan horse of ‘youth rights’— an agenda that’s already influencing schools, medical care, and the law. Under the guise of promoting children’s “rights” to make their own choices, progressives are relentlessly fencing parents out of the crucial, value-laden decisions in their children’s lives.

Pediatricians Vs. Parents

Consider an ordinary aspect of family life: a trip to the pediatrician’s office.

Parents of 12- and 13-year-olds may find themselves unceremoniously ejected from the pediatrician’s examining room so that the doctor can speak privately with their child. It used to be that parents stepped out discreetly for a moment during the physical exam of an opposite-sex child, out of respect for the child’s developing body and desire for modesty.

But that’s not why parents are shown the door these days.

Willing or not, today’s pediatrician is a field agent in the campaign for ‘youth rights,’ a global movement that insists children have the capacity—and the right—to make their own decisions about issues that concern them, particularly questions of sexual identity, sexual behavior, and reproductive health. In reality, the demand for ‘youth rights’ is simply cover for the left’s aggressive promotion of its radical sexual agenda.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) seems to have embraced its part in the youth rights campaign. In recent policy statements on emergency contraception and the care of LGBTQ youth, the AAP urges pediatricians to “counsel,” educate, and support young people in the exercise of their sexual and reproductive rights.

The AAP tells its physicians that, “regardless” of the adolescent’s “current intentions for sexual behavior,” the pediatrician should discuss “sexual safety and family planning,” as a matter of “routine anticipatory guidance.” In addition, the conscientious pediatrician will go even further, offering to “supply” both boys and girls with emergency contraception to “have on hand in case of future need.”

Pediatricians Secretly Assisting With … Sexual Identity?

The progressive powers-that-be have decided that providing emergency contraception is part of the new script for adolescent care— even if the teen doesn’t request it. ‘Let’s check your height, listen to your lungs, and send you home with some emergency contraception.’ With no judgment, shame, or stigma, of course. (And no regard either for family concerns about the health, emotional, and moral implications of teen sex and emergency contraception.)

Similarly, the AAP statement on LGBTQ youth envisions that pediatricians will play “a role in helping teenagers sort through their [sexual] feelings and behaviors…pediatricians should assist adolescents as they develop their identities and to avoid the consequences of unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), regardless of sexual orientation.”

The youth rights movement in general—presumes that parents are the child’s adversaries, likely to threaten or thwart the adolescent’s budding independence, especially about sexual matters.

In a blatantly political move, the AAP policy also condemns “heterosexism” (the idea that “heterosexuality is the expected norm and that somehow LGBTQ teens are ‘abnormal’”) and recommends that pediatricians display pictures of same-sex couples in order to be more welcoming to “sexual minority” youth. And lest children miss the inclusive message, the AAP tells pediatricians to ask adolescents (even those who are not yet sexually active) if they are attracted to or having sex with “males, females, or both.”

In all these discussions, the family pediatrician is expected to offer him or herself as the ‘trusted adult’—effectively supplanting the parent—in whom an adolescent confides, and from whom he or she seeks advice, about sex, gender, sexual orientation, and “responsible” behavior.

The AAP statements are troubling not only because they put a professional stamp of approval on progressive sexual ideology, but also because they fail to acknowledge parents’ rightful interest in and expertise regarding the wellbeing of their children.

In fact, the AAP—like the youth rights movement in general—presumes that parents are the child’s adversaries, likely to threaten or thwart the adolescent’s budding independence, especially about sexual matters. The physician, warns the AAP, should not “inform parents/guardians about the teenager’s sexual identity or behavior; doing so could expose the youth to harm.”

The Mature Minor Exceptions

‘Preventing harm,’ of course, has been the rationale advanced for decades to justify providing sexual and reproductive health care to teens without parental permission. In the wake of the Supreme Court’s tangled abortion jurisprudence, courts and many state legislatures implemented expansive ‘mature minor’ exceptions to parental consent rules, in order to ensure ‘emergency’ care for minors. Georgetown Law Professor Jeffrey Shulman—no fan of parental rights—observes that, “The truth is that the state has wrested control from parents over some of a young person‘s most intimate and morally problematic personal decisions.” And the state has given that decision-making authority to young people themselves.

“The truth is that the state has wrested control from parents over some of a young person‘s most intimate and morally problematic personal decisions.”

Although U.S., schools, courts, and the medical community abide by the convenient fiction that teenagers have the capacity to make mature decisions about life-altering sexual and reproductive matters, several scholars have recently criticized the “mission creep” of the mature minor doctrine in light of brain research that demonstrates the immaturity of teen-age decision-making and developments in criminal law that discourage treating minors as mature adults.

But youth rights activists don’t tarry long over harm-based rationales or new research developments, choosing instead to celebrate young people’s “rights” to sexual health. The new “sexual health paradigm” frames “sexual rights, sexual knowledge, sexual choice, and sexual pleasure” as essential aspects of wellbeing, for pubescent teens as well as for adults.

In the ‘sexual health’ paradigm, children are ‘rights holders’ and parents are ‘barriers’ to the exercise of those rights. It’s a common theme that’s played out not only private doctors’ offices, but also in teen ‘reproductive health’ clinics, school-based health centers, and in sexuality education courses.

The Teen and Young Adult Health Connection (TAYA) of Maryland, for example, offers a smorgasbord of confidential sexual health services to “men, women, and transgender people ages 12- 35.” Got that? Twelve-year old children are “men” and “women” in the ideologically-driven world of sexual and reproductive health. These children are drawn by the promise of confidentiality (their parents won’t find out), given “sexual health” advice by reproductive rights activists, and complimented for their ‘mature’ decision-making. The testimony of a young TAYA client named “Patricia” is instructive: “I came here when I was 16 to get an IUD and I can truly say that [the clinic] changed my life. It’s a place that my mom doesn’t know about…I was respected here, was given all the options, and was informed. And that made me feel like I could make good decisions about my health on my own.”

Bring On Obamacare

Consistent with the youth-rights-based approach, Obamacare makes it a whole lot easier for children to keep parents in the dark about their ‘good decisions.’ The contraceptive mandate, which requires employers’ insurance to offer free ‘women’s health’ preventive services without a co-pay, solves a sticky problem for advocates of youth sexual rights—confidentiality. In the past, office visits to obtain contraceptives or receive treatment for ‘sexual health’ typically required co-pays, obliging insurers to send an explanation of benefits (EOB) to the policyholder. According to the Guttmacher Institute, Obamacare’s “no co-pay” rule for preventive services has spurred some states and insurance companies to eliminate the EOB for these services, ensuring the teen’s privacy in sexual and reproductive health matters.

Parents who know nothing about their children’s sexual activity have no power to influence their children’s decisions—but that’s the point.

The practical result: Mom and Dad won’t know that their sweet 13-year-old is receiving antibiotics for an acute chlamydia infection—leaving them unaware and powerless to protect her from coerced or abusive sex. They won’t know that their sixteen-year-old was fitted for an IUD and may be suffering side effects like pain, bleeding, and infection. And they won’t know that their 15-year old son, recently out and proud, just tested positive for HIV. (LGBT advocates probably didn’t tell him that CDC reports show HIV running rampant in gay communities, afflicting one out of five “men who have sex with men” (MSM). And they probably forgot to mention that new HIV infections spiked 22% among the youngest MSM (ages 13-24) and that there’s been a “resurgence” of serious sexually transmitted infections, such as syphilis and gonorrhea, among MSM who “substitute” oral sex for anal sex, hoping to avoid HIV.)

Parents who know nothing about their children’s sexual activity have no power to influence their children’s decisions—but that’s the point.

Obamacare has boosted youth rights in another way, by providing a funding stream of over $200 million to support US. School-based Health Centers (SBHCs). School-based health centers (SBHC) aspire to be the ‘medical home’ for many students, addressing all their health needs—including sexual and reproductive health—right on school premises. (Parental consent is required for ordinary illnesses, but a “special exception” allows teens to consent for their own sexual and reproductive care.)

SBHC staff members are taught to be opportunists, promoting available sexual and reproductive services to all students. According to Deborah Kaplan, Assistant Commissioner of the New York City Bureau of Maternal, Infant & Reproductive Health, “every young person” who seeks any kind of treatment in New York City’s School-Based Health Centers is asked “the key question,” whether “he or she [is] sexually active.” Ms. Kaplan considers it a sign of success that “there’s been more and more word of mouth among students asking for IUDs,” and she expects the numbers to “grow dramatically” as a result.

By Teens, For Teens? Not By A Long Shot

For the youth rights crowd, the only message kids must hear is “Know your rights to sex education, birth control, and more.” In fact, the website Sex, etc offers teens an interactive map of “Sex in the States,” with state-by-state details related to kids’ “sexual rights,” including age of consent, confidentiality, and availability of contraception and abortion. The New York City Health Department, ever helpful, has developed a “Teens in NYC” mobile app as well, to tell teens “where to go” to obtain contraception—and abortions.

The Sex, etc. website also demonstrates a prime strategy of the youth rights movement: its banner proclaims that it is “by teens, for teens.” It’s nothing of the sort.

Sex, etc. is published and funded by Answer, a national organization that’s been promoting, for over 30 years, young people’s “unfettered access” to explicit sexuality education. Answer recommends Planned Parenthood as a resource for parents of pre-teens (9-13), and complains that state policies that require children to learn that sex is “only appropriate within the context of a heterosexual marriage” are “bad news.”

Youth advocates purposely create the perception that the youth ‘sexual rights’ movement is a bottom-up, youth-driven movement. It’s not. It is a strategic, long-term business plan for an unholy alliance of pro-choice, sexuality-education providers, including Advocates for Youth, Answer, and SIECUS (the Sexuality Education and Information Council of the United States).

These three organizations have spearheaded an initiative—The Future of Sex Education Project (FoSE)—aimed at “revolutionizing” sexuality education in the U.S. through a uniform program of instruction (indoctrination) that they hope will be installed in every public school in America. FoSe’s “National Sexuality Education Standards” set forth a “progressive and pragmatic” K-12 program of “Core Content and Skills” related to sexuality, contraception, safer sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation.

But it’s a corrupt vision of sexuality, peddled by self-appointed “experts” with much to gain: the FoSE partners offer “myriad resources, tailored training and technical assistance on policy, advocacy and mobilization for state-based and local organizations and coalitions working to promote the sexual health of young people” —‘sexual health’ built on a destructive platform of meaningless sex, free contraception, and unlimited abortion. Even so, business seems to be booming.

The Trojan Horse of ‘youth rights’ has been welcomed into the city. Call me Cassandra, but its presence does not bode well for our children.

"In Arizona, GOP Shows How Easily It Will Cave On Religious Liberty","Arizona is populated largely by warty, crooked-fingered Christians who were waiting excitedly to eject LGBT people from their restaurants, flower shops, and laundromats until Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed SB 1062.

This is the only conclusion one can draw from the hysterical claims peddled by LGBT activists, business leaders, and several prominent Republicans about the infamous religious liberty bill. If the bill were to have been signed into law, we were led to believe that Arizona’s economic competitiveness and international reputation would have been disastrously diminished.

All of the explicit and implicit claims about the negative consequences of SB 1062 were founded in ignorance—in most cases willful, blameworthy ignorance.

Here’s what you need to know about religious liberty and LGBT rights in Arizona.

In 1990, the Supreme Court’s decision in Employment Division v. Smith established that a “neutral law of general applicability” could impinge on religious practice without violating the First Amendment. Alarmed at this erosion of traditional religious liberty protections, Congress responded by passing nearly unanimously the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which applies the highest level of judicial scrutiny to laws which restrict religious practice.

RFRA, however, has been held only to apply to federal laws. In 1999, Arizona passed its own, nearly identical version of RFRA in order to afford religious practice in that state the same protections afforded federally. Any law which “substantially burdens” the exercise of religion must further a “compelling government interest” and be the “least restrictive means” of furthering that interest.

There are ambiguities, however, in Arizona’s RFRA that have been sources of litigation, mostly about whom, exactly, these laws protect and in what circumstances. SB 1062 would have resolved these ambiguities in ways that define RFRA’s protections broadly and that are consistent with federal religious liberty jurisprudence. SB 1062 provided a) that RFRA protects corporations just the same as natural persons, b) that RFRA can be used as a defense in court against a suit by a private citizen, and c) that RFRA claims can be brought not just against the state government, but against all municipalities and “state actors” in Arizona.

That, you may be surprised to learn, is it.

That, you may be surprised to learn, is it. Corporations, as legal persons, get religious liberty protection. Religious liberty can be used as a defense if you’re sued by a private citizen. Religious liberty protections apply at all levels of Arizona government.

Crucially, SB 1062 does not, under any conceivable definition, affirm a “right to discriminate.” All that it does is expand the circumstances under which religious liberty claims can be heard in court; it does not (unlike the recent, equally controversial Kansas law) prescribe the outcomes of those hearings.

But there’s more. Despite hysterical claims that SB 1062 would have “legalized discrimination” in Arizona, you may be surprised to learn that sexual orientation and gender identity are not protected classes in Arizona. Which is to say, except in Phoenix, Flagstaff, and Tucson, which include those traits in local ordinances, it’s already legal to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in Arizona.

That dystopian Arizona with LGBT folks sitting at different lunch counters and forced out of jobs en masse and booted from retail stores? You know, the one promised by LGBT activists, and then by Marriott and Intel and Yelp, and then, implicitly, by John McCain and Mitt Romney and Laura Ingraham? Under Arizona law, that could exist right now. And yet it doesn’t. Because Arizona isn’t full of hordes of cackling Christians plotting an LGBT apartheid state.

Those dire predictions peddled by LGBT activists were guilelessly parroted by the media, by the business community, and by many Republicans. And they were nothing more than Christian-baiting fearmongering.

GOP leaders chose the easier route, selling out not just conservatives or Christians, but the principle of religious liberty itself.

It took me five minutes to find and to read the State of Arizona’s synopsis of SB 1062, and only a few minutes more to digest some basic legal analysis. (I’m indebted to Ilya Shapiro at the Cato Institute and, especially, to a bipartisan coalition of religious liberty legal scholars for some of the information above.) That’s how long—five minutes—it would have taken aides to John McCain, Jeff Flake, Mitt Romney, Laura Ingraham, and any number of other religious liberty defectors to educate their bosses about this inert piece of legislation. They could have used their bully pulpits to push back against misinformation. Instead they chose the easier route, seizing the opportunity to establish credentials as People of Respectable Opinions by ignorantly selling out not just conservatives or Christians, but the principle of religious liberty itself.

The political strategy employed by Republicans in this controversy—to accept passively and incuriously the messaging of their political opponents—would in any other instance be considered political malpractice. Three Republican state senators admitted to this passivity, writing to Gov. Brewer in opposition to the bill for which they had voted: “the bill has…been mischaracterized by its opponents as a sword for religious intolerance. These allegations are causing our state immeasurable harm.” It’s not the bill causing harm, but its mendacious opponents—and yet they hasten to hoist the white flag.

Passively and incuriously accepting the messaging of their political opponents—would in any other instance be considered political malpractice.

One can imagine how this strategy would have played out in, for instance, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s crusade against that state’s public sector unions. The GOP would have been cowed by the unions’ show of force, issued statements indicating no offense was meant, apologized for embarrassing the state of Wisconsin, and forced Gov. Walker to perform ritual self-immolation in the State Capitol.

But in Arizona, this passivity was hailed by the media and the political establishment as the pinnacle of prudence. In Arizona, we’ve been reminded exactly whom the GOP is willing, even eager, to sell out.

It’s been clear for quite some time now that the Republican Party’s commitment to social conservatives, especially on issues of marriage and sexuality, is not principled, but contingent. As public opinion shifts, the party makes no attempt to wield its massive influence to arrest that shift (no, platform planks don’t count); it glides along with it, if perhaps a beat or two behind. But on religious liberty, the GOP seemed poised to stand its ground. Until now.

Because the fact of the matter is, if SB 1062 was unacceptable, then no substantive religious liberty protections will ever be acceptable. SB 1062—nothing more than a clarification and slight broadening of Arizona’s RFRA in line with federal standards—was the bare minimum.

To abandon SB 1062 was to abandon people dragged before local “human rights commissions,” like Blaine Adamson, whose refusal to print gay pride t-shirts landed him in trouble with the city of Lexington, Kentucky.

To abandon SB 1062 was to abandon corporations like Hobby Lobby and, from my home state, the Menonite-owned Conestoga Wood Specialties in their suits over the HHS Mandate. To abandon SB 1062 was to abandon religious people in civil suits, like Barronelle Stutzman of Washington State, who is being sued by long-time clients for refusing to provide flowers for their wedding—a reminder that these religious liberty claims are rarely about antipathy toward people, but rather conscientious objections to facilitating events and behaviors. To abandon SB 1062 was to abandon people dragged before local “human rights commissions,” like Blaine Adamson, whose refusal to print gay pride t-shirts landed him in trouble with the city of Lexington, Kentucky.

In fact, any argument against SB 1062 was an argument against RFRA itself. If SB 1062 was unconscionable, or embarrassing, or anti-business, or even unconstitutional (as Secretary of State John Kerry claimed on Wednesday) then so is RFRA. If SB 1062 wan’t worth standing up for, then neither is RFRA, and therefore neither is anything beyond the de minimis religious liberty protections offered in Employment Division v. Smith.

These logical entailments should serve to demonstrate how misguided the hostility to SB 1062 was, but I fear, in the absence of one of our two political parties standing up for a robust conception of religious liberty, it will work the other way. The flaming-out of SB 1062 to the tune of GOP cheers will be considered, sooner rather than later, a mandate not just to oppose further religious liberty protections, but to roll back those that already exist.

The Washington Examiner’s Justin Green, certainly not a shill for anyone’s establishment, tweeted on Tuesday that SB 1062 is “electoral suicide” and that “sometimes you gotta suck it up and lose.” Quite right, in theory. But first we must ask what it is we are losing, and if it’s something worth fighting for.

Religious liberty is worth fighting for. But will anyone stand up to fight?

Bait And Switch: How Same Sex Marriage Ends Family Autonomy,"Abolishing all civil marriage is the primary goal of the elites who have been pushing same sex marriage. The scheme called “marriage equality” is not an end in itself, and never really has been. The LGBT agenda has spawned too many other disparate agendas hostile to the existence of marriage, making marriage “unsustainable,” if you will. By now we should be able to hear the growing drumbeat to abolish civil marriage, as well as to legalize polygamy and all manner of reproductive technologies.

Consider also the breakneck speed at which the push for same sex marriage has been happening recently. The agenda’s advocates have been very methodical in their organization, disciplined in their timing, flush with money, in control of all information outlets, including media, Hollywood, and academia. And perhaps most telling is the smearing of any dissenter in the public square, a stigma made de rigueur by Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy in his animus-soaked opinion that repealed the Defense of Marriage Act.

We’ve seen also how the Obama Administration’s push for same sex marriage has occurred in lockstep with policies that are hostile to marriage, such as the severe marriage penalty written into Obamacare.

Activist judges have taken their cues from Attorney General Eric Holder who used the DOMA repeal to proclaim open season on any state that recognizes marriage as an organic (i.e., heterosexual) union of one man and one woman. In their crosshairs are state constitutions, businesses, students, communities, churches, and all of those bogus “conscience clauses” that were written into same sex marriage legislation in order to sway wavering state legislators to vote “aye.”

The tipping point came soon after certain big name conservatives and pundits swallowed the bait on same sex marriage. Folks like Michael Barone, John Bolton, George Will, S. E. Cupp, and David Blankenhorn have played a huge role in building momentum for this movement, which, as we will see, is blazing a trail to the abolition of state recognized marriage. And whether they know it or not, advocacy for same sex marriage is putting a lot of statist machinery into motion. Because once the state no longer has to recognize your marriage and family, the state no longer has to respect the existence of your marriage and family.

Without civil marriage, the family can no longer exist autonomously and serve as a wall of separation between the individual and the state. This has huge implications for the survival of freedom of association.

The notion of marriage equality was never about marriage or about equality. It’s all about the wrapping paper. It’s been packaged as an end in itself, but it is principally just a means to a deeper end. It is the means by which marriage extinction – the true target — can be achieved. If marriage and family are permitted to exist autonomously, power can be de-centralized in society. So the family has always been a thorn in the side of central planners and totalitarians. The connection between its abolition and the limitless growth of the state should be crystal clear. So anyone who has bought into this movement, or is tempted to do so, would want to step back and take a harder look.

Six Indicators We’re Headed Directly for Abolishing Civil Marriage

We can sort out six developments that indicate we’re on the fast track to abolishing civil marriage. They include: 1) The blueprint for abolishing family, developed by the founder of feminist legal theory, Martha Fineman; 2) support and advocacy of Fineman’s model by facilitators and regulators in the Obama Administration; 3) the statements of prominent LGBT activists themselves, including their 2006 manifesto which in effect established the abolition of marriage as the goal of the same sex marriage movement; 4) the demographic shift to single rather than married households; 5) the growing shift in social climate from marriage equality to marriage hostility; and 6) the recent push to export the LGBT agenda globally, particularly targeting poor and developing nations of Africa.

1) The Gender Theorist Model: Replace civil marriage with government-regulated contractual relationships

Collectivist style parenting may still seem like the stuff of science fiction to a lot of folks, but the ground for it has softened a lot since Hillary Clinton’s 1996 treatise It Takes a Village and American Federation of Teachers president Sandra Feldman’s 1998 op-ed “The Childswap Society.” We now have MSNBC anchor Melissa Harris-Perry declaring open war on traditional families by announcing “We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.”

She envisages that the State will fill the vacuum left by the abolition of family

The abolition of marriage and family has been a longtime project of gender theorists. Among them is internationally renown feminist law theorist Martha Albertson Fineman whose 2004 book The Autonomy Myth argues strenuously for “the abolition of marriage as a legal category.” Her treatise is breathtaking in its brazen approach to ending family autonomy and privacy.

Fineman advocates for a system that would unavoidably result in the regulation of personal relationships through legal contracts. “Contract,” she writes “is an appealing metaphor with which to consider social and political arrangements. It imagines autonomous adults” hashing out the terms, etc. Yet she envisages that the State will fill the vacuum left by the abolition of family [emphasis added]:

“. . . in addition to contract rules, I anticipate that ameliorating doctrines would fill the void left by the abolition of this aspect of family law. In fact, it seems apparent to me that a lot more regulation (protection) would occur once interactions between individuals within families were removed from behind the veil of privacy that now shields them.”

Fineman operates on the apparent assumption that family privacy serves no purpose other than to afford institutional protection for men behaving badly. Her prescription is sweeping: “Once the institutional protection [is] removed, behavior would be judged by standards established to regulate interactions among all members of society.” [emphasis added]

There you have it. All of your social interactions judged by certain standards. Standards established by whom? The state. And lest our eyes glaze over at mention of it, we ought to think of the State for what it really is: a hierarchy of cliques, with one dominant clique at the top. (Think mean girls in charge of everything and everyone.)

Fineman replaces the word “spouse” with the term “sexual affiliate,” because, she professes, what we think of as “family” should be defined by its function, not its form. In other words, only “caretaker-dependent relationships” would be recognized in the sense that “family” is recognized today.

So the abolition of marriage, according to Fineman:

“would mean that sexual affiliates (formerly labeled husband and wife) would be regulated by the terms of their individualized agreements, with no special rules governing fairness and no unique review or monitoring of the negotiation process.”

Feel better? Fineman also states approvingly that:

“if the family is defined functionally, focused on the caretaker-dependent relationship, the traditionally problematic interactions of sexual affiliates (formerly designated “spouses”) are not protected by notions of family privacy.”

Indeed, no interaction could be protected by “notions of family privacy” in Fineman’s model. She elaborated further and more recently on all of this in an October 2013 article in the Chicago-Kent Law Review.

2) Friends in High Places promote Fineman’s Model of State-Regulated Contracts

Cass Sunstein, who served as President Obama’s regulatory czar from 2009 to 2012, has advocated strongly for the abolition of civil marriage and its replacement with contracts that would negotiate the terms of personal relationships.

In 2008 Sunstein published an article in the Cardozo Law Review arguing that there is no constitutional right to marry and suggesting that “states may abolish marriage without offending the Constitution.” And an entire chapter of a popular book Sunstein co-authored with Richard Thaler in 2008 is devoted to arguing for the abolition of civil marriage. This is from Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness.

“Under our proposal, the word marriage would no longer appear in any laws, and marriage licenses would no longer be offered or recognized by any level of government. . . . Under our approach, the only legal status states would confer on couples would be a civil union, which would be a domestic partnership agreement between any two people.*(*Footnote: We duck the question of whether civil unions can involve more than two people.)”

Sunstein and Thaler dub their approach “libertarian paternalism,” an odd jargon which seems contrived to win over readers by evoking a strange juxtaposition of moderation and a heavy touch of the archaic.

Clearly, Sunstein has been laying the groundwork for the abolition of civil marriage. He purports that this would get the government out of a “licensing scheme,” but his specious phrasing is a fig leaf covering up the predictable effects of his approach: greater government regulation of personal relationships. His popular writing on the subject comes in the guise of “privatization” of relationships – even as gender theorists like Fineman argue against America’s “obsession” with privacy and individualism. But this is not a difficult circle to square. Thaler and Sunstein argue, pretty much in line with Fineman, that people ought to make use of contracts to define the terms of their relationships. And contracts invite – indeed, for Fineman, they demand – that the government function as an intimate partner in this legal ménage a trois.

3) LGBT Activists Say So Themselves: The Goal is to Abolish Marriage

“Gay marriage is a lie,” announced gay activist Masha Gessen in a panel discussion last year at the Sydney Writers’ Festival. “Fighting for gay marriage generally involves lying about what we’re going to do with marriage when we get there.” [Applause.] “It’s a no-brainer that the institution of marriage should not exist.”

Gessen was merely echoing a message from an LGBT manifesto of 2006 called Beyond Same Sex Marriage. The manifesto is a blatant rallying cry to bring about a post-marriage society, one in which there is no room for state-recognized marriage.

“It’s a no-brainer that the institution of marriage should not exist.”

Ethics and Public Policy Institute scholar Stanley Kurtz wrote extensively about this document in two National Review articles, entitled The Confession and The Confession II. Kurtz noted that the intent of the sponsors of the manifesto – which as of 2006 had hundreds of prominent signatories, including Cornel West, Barbara Ehrenreich, Martha Fineman, and Gloria Steinem – was “to dissolve marriage by extending the definition to every conceivable family type.”

Sunstein needn’t have “ducked the issue” of more than two parties in a domestic contract because legalizing polygamy is central to the manifesto. And there can be no doubt that the legalization of polygamy would result in the abolition of all state-recognized marriage. Polygamy — repackaged in the now trendy term “polyamory” – comes with an array of configurations too dizzying and with too many moving parts to be sustained as state-recognized marriage.

Despite the existence of the manifesto, the official line of the LGBT community still seems to be that gay marriage is only about equal rights for couples who love one another. Their spokespersons have been disciplined – with a friendly media running cover for them – in maintaining the official line so as not to provoke a debate about the real agenda to abolish marriage.

Supposedly conservative gay activists like Jonathan Rauch have also run cover and protected the timing of the agenda by claiming that the manifesto was merely a “fringe” of the LGBT movement. It’s irrelevant whether or not Rauch really believes his own propaganda that gay marriage will somehow strengthen a marriage culture by bringing loving gay couples into it. The main effect of the Rauch meme is to accelerate the abolition of civil marriage by hastening a legal framework for genderless marriage that will pave the way for total abolition of civil marriage, and with it private family life.

It’s clear the gloves are coming off and timing has entered a new phase. The push for polyamory has gone mainstream, right on schedule. Supportive puff pieces on it are popping up in places like Atlantic Monthly and the erstwhile women’s magazine Redbook. In the end, polyamory serves only as a transitory way station between the legalization of same sex marriage and the abolition of civil marriage.

4) Growing Dominance of Singles

Recent decades have seen a sharp upsurge of unmarried households. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2012 there were 103 million unmarried people 18 and older. That’s 44 percent of all US residents over 18. And 62 percent of those 103 million had never been married. Unmarried individuals represented 56 million households in 2012. The rise in singles has had an undeniably huge impact on the electorate. In the 2012 election 39 percent of the voters were unmarried, compared to 24 percent of the voters in the 1972 election.

The “Communication League for Unmarried Equality,” is a coalition of singles’ rights organizations which argues that government benefits for marriage – including tax breaks and survivor benefits in social security — amount to marital status discrimination. Its advocates argue that civil marriage unjustly awards financial, social, and cultural benefits to married individuals at the expense of unmarried individuals who end up subsidizing marriage and children, without compensation. In addition, proponents of “unmarried equality” insist that the existence of these privileges serve to perpetuate prejudices and stereotypes about singles that inflict harm on them. (Sounds like a Supreme Court case brewing.)

Bella DePaulo spearheaded the movement as a blogger and author of Singled Out and Singlism: What it is, Why it Matters and How to Stop It.” According to DePaulo, the discrimination she calls “singlism” may seem more subtle than racism or sexism, but is just as damaging. She has tip-toed to the edge of advocating for the abolition of marriage, with a professor of feminist philosophy Elizabeth Blake, by saying that marriage should be “minimized” (for now) so that singles have the same benefits as married individuals. Which, naturally, means abolishing marriage.

“Singlism” itself is not yet considered a form of illegal discrimination. But DePaulo believes it should be:

“Because singlism is built right into American laws, it is not possible to be single and not be a target of discrimination. If you have followed the marriage equality debate, then you probably know that there are more than 1,000 federal laws that benefit or protect only those people who are legally married. Even if same-sex marriage becomes legal throughout the land, all those people who are single — whether gay or straight or any other status — will still remain second class citizens.”

5) Morphing of the Memes – from Marriage Equality to Marriage Ambivalence to Marriage Hostility

“Why would anyone get married?” That’s a quote from Nancy Pelosi in a Valentine’s Day interview last month, downplaying the importance of marriage. While some might say she’s simply courting the singles demographic, she’s mostly reinforcing and echoing a narrative that marriage is irrelevant or perhaps even harmful. She is contributing to the drumbeat to abolish civil marriage.

Let’s not forget Julia, the mascot of Obama’s reelection campaign who serves as a Stepford wife to the State.

Major cultural forces – the media, academia, and Hollywood – have already adopted an increasingly hostile view of marriage. We can see it in the use of the term “greedy marrieds” from a recent New York Times feature “The Changing American Family“: “Single people live alone and proudly consider themselves families of one — more generous and civic-minded than ‘greedy marrieds.’”

And look at NBC Sports in its coverage Olympic gold medalist skier David Wise. It described him as living an “alternative lifestyle” because he happened to be young and married with children. The clear inference was that he was abnormal.

The promotion and glorification of single parenting which got its start with the Murphy Brown TV series of the 1990s has gone into hyperdrive now. Check out online services such as Modamily, that matches people with “parenting partners,” with whom they can draw up a contract, arrange for artificial reproductive technologies, and forgo marriage.

And let’s not forget Julia, the mascot of Obama’s reelection campaign who serves, with more than a bit of irony, as a Stepford wife to the State. The narrative was clearly hostile to the idea of marriage and supportive of policies to abolish it.

6) LGBT Push for Same Sex Marriage in Developing Countries

The rush by LGBT activists and the Obama administration to lift bans on gay marriage in all 50 states is peculiarly fast and furious. Oddly so for a movement that seems to be gaining steam and social compliance. A reasonable question would be: What’s the rush if things are going so swimmingly your way? The only answer seems to be one of fragile timing.

The sudden LGBT push globally, especially in Africa, should give us pause as well. Why the abrupt shove into poor countries, threatening to cut off aid unless they comply with such a massive cultural shift and adopt the Western LGBT agenda? Why the laser focus on Uganda and Malawi instead of places like Iran where abuses of homosexuals are likely just as common?

We are witnessing a major strategy to export gay marriage – and all it entails for the abolition of marriage — worldwide. President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry have made an example of Uganda by threatening to cut off its aid over the existence of its anti-sodomy laws. Other developing nations are expected to take note and fall into line, creating a cascade effect until any other nation who resists will feel the noose tightening.

We might reasonably ask why this particular agenda is getting so much attention while the world goes to hell in a hand basket. Syria is overrun with vicious terrorist gangs at least as bad as its president. Russia is flexing its muscles, having just invaded the Ukraine and Crimea. Christians are being exterminated in record numbers throughout the Middle East. We’re looking at nuclear weapons in Iran. There’s a nuclear threat from North Korea, which not only starves its own people but is run by a guy who, it was said, feeds his political enemies to starving dogs. And yet President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry have been spending special quality time focusing on the LGBT agenda in in the poor countries of Africa?

Clearly the Western LGBT agenda represents a new brand of cultural imperialism that is not content to shape life at home, but intends to propagate itself – and all it entails – worldwide.

Ending Marriage Leads To A Centralized All Powerful State

The hard push for marriage equality was never about marriage. Neither was it about equality. It’s a convenient vehicle to abolish civil marriage, whether to rid the world of paternalism, evade responsibility for children, “privatize” relationships, or whatever. Abolishing marriage strips the family of its autonomy by placing it much more directly under the regulating control of the state.

Once the state no longer has to recognize the marriage relationship and its presumption of privilege and privacy, we all become atomized individuals in the eyes of the state, officially strangers to one another. We lose the space – the buffer zone – that the institution of the natural, organic family previously gave us and that forced the state to keep its distance.

Isn’t it ironic that feminists would replace the “paternalism” of marriage (what happened to strong women?) with the new paternalism of state regulation of personal relationships? Isn’t it ironic that singles in this scheme of things simply end up marrying the state?

At some point, we must conclude that freedom of association has its source in state acceptance of the core family as the primary buffer zone between the individual and the state. There is no escaping this fact, no matter a particular generation’s attitude or public opinion polling, or advances in medical technology, or whatever else comes our way.



Marriage Is The Template For Freedom Of Association

Without state recognition of – and respect for – marriage, can freedom of association survive? How so? On what basis?

Civil marriage provides the entire basis for presuming the rights and responsibilities of biological parents to raise their own children. It also assumes the right of spouses to refuse to testify against one another in court. It presumes survivorship – in guardianship of children as well as inheritance of property. If we abolish civil marriage, these will no longer be rights by default, but rights to be distributed at the pleasure of a bureaucratic state.

When a couple enters into a civil marriage, they are not inviting the government into their relationship, but rather putting the government on notice that they are a family unit. It’s the couple – not the state – that’s in the driver’s seat.Otherwise, they needn’t marry. Otherwise, central planners wouldn’t be so intent on abolishing marriage as a private and autonomous association from which the state must keep its distance, unless one partner wishes to exit by divorce.

Children – i.e., all of us born into a family – inherit that presumption of autonomy and broadcast it into society. We do so whether or not we ever get married ourselves. The presumption of family autonomy and privacy informs our right to freely associate with others – through romances, friendships, business contracts, and so on. It would be catastrophic to freedom if we threw it away.

State recognition of this autonomy cannot exist without state recognition of marriage. In fact, traditional marriage — just like traditional oxygen if you will – helps all of society breathe more freely.

If civil marriage is abolished, you can say hello to the government at your bedroom door because that comfortable little meme about “getting the state out of the marriage business” will have flown out your bedroom window while you were sleeping.

Discrimination Is Healthy And Normal—Sex Confusion Is Not,"In Billings, Montana, “Brokeback Mountain” isn’t a Hollywood fantasy anymore. It’s real-life drama now with legal consequences, as a wave of deceptively labeled “non-discrimination ordinances” begins to whistle across the valleys in this rural state.

It’s not just Montana. These ordinances are beginning to embed themselves in cities nationwide. The culture wars are back, with families clutching crucifixes on one side, and lawyer-backed tolerance enforcers on the other.

Clergy, mothers, fathers, and citizens have packed the Billings town council meetings for several weeks now, pleaded for it to reject an ordinance that, in its current incarnation, would forbid employers from refusing to hire someone based on “sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, Veteran’s status, political beliefs or obesity.” Neither may employers give a negative report about an employee or businesses refuse services based on these characteristics.

Why are small-town people so eager to pass an elitist, special-interest law more appropriate for big-city folks?

Similar ordinances have passed in Bozeman, Butte, Helena, and Missoula—essentially all the population centers in a state with just 1 million residents. The state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and activist groups are going local after failing to secure a statewide law conferring special rights on privileged sexual practices. They expect passing city ordinances will reduce opposition to a statewide law in the future.

Unlike President Obama, who is preparing to issue an executive order imposing a directive similar to these ordinances on federal contractors, the Billings city council isn’t a bunch of hardened liberal activists. At a population of 100,000, Billings is Montana’s largest town. Why are small-town people so eager to pass an elitist, special-interest law more appropriate for big-city folks?

Their likely motivation is to be nice. Discrimination sounds so terrible. Shouldn’t people with power stop it in every form? That sounds plausible, but like the other arguments offered by LGBTQ activists (when they offer arguments instead of appeals to emotion), it’s wrong and hurtful.

Here’s why “non-discrimination” ordinances and their ilk are anti-science, anti-reason, and anti-humanity.

The LGBTQ View Is Anti-Science

Except for a tiny number of people with gene disabilities, every human being has either XX or XY chromosomes embedded in every cell of his or her body. That makes each of us biologically male or female, no matter how we feel about that fact. To believe otherwise is essentially a psychiatric disorder. Dr. Paul McHugh, retired from psychiatry at Johns Hopkins Hospital, recently likened transsexuality to anorexia and bulimia, since all are disorders in which the individual substitutes his preference for reality. He writes, “These disorders occur in subjects who have come to believe that some of their psycho-social conflicts or problems will be resolved if they can change the way that they appear to others. Such ideas work like ruling passions in their subjects’ minds and tend to be accompanied by a solipsistic argument. For the transgendered, this argument holds that one’s feeling of ‘gender’ is a conscious, subjective sense that, being in one’s mind, cannot be questioned by others. The individual often seeks not just society’s tolerance of this ‘personal truth’ but affirmation of it.”

No matter how one frames it, reality is still reality, and sexuality is not just mental.

This is not just a transsexual thing. The separation of person from body was pioneered by homosexual activists and feminists, who repeatedly chant “biology is not destiny.” Here’s a prime example, from Monday’s town council meeting in Billings. The Billings Gazette quotes Marian Bradley, founder of NOW Montana: “Our genitals do not define who we are. Who we are is defined by how we live as women.” No matter how one frames it, however, reality is still reality, and sexuality is not just mental. No matter how many body parts we cut from and paste onto ourselves, or how many different objects we can stick our sex organs into or vice versa, male and female chromosomes and body parts are a biological fact that only science deniers ignore.

Stop Contradicting Yourself

Billings’ draft LGBTQ ordinance participates in this anti-science view of the human person. For one, it extends its protections to people who fantasize they are neither male nor female, but “non-binary,” or “other.” I’m sorry, but there is no other out here in the real world, unless one intends to mean people who have genetic defects such as XXY chromosomes (and they are protected by disability laws). The ordinance defines “gender identity or expression” as “a gender-related identity, expression, or behavior, regardless of the individual’s sex at birth.” On the one hand, it acknowledges people have a certain biology—at least, at birth. But apparently it also says biological reality ends at birth, which is not just anti-science but utterly illogical. Do people’s X chromosomes disappear, or Y chromosomes suddenly replace them? For that matter, do women typically start sprouting facial hair or men grow wombs? Not without heavy, unnatural intervention, and no intervention can convert every single gene in someone’s body into its opposite.

Male and female chromosomes and body parts are a biological fact that only science deniers ignore.

The council attempted to relieve some obvious harm their ordinance would inflict upon residents by including this provision in the ordinance: “In places of public accommodation where users normally appear in the nude, users may be required to use the facilities designated for their anatomical sex, regardless of their gender identity.” Women have been voicing fears about finding men in their bathrooms and locker rooms. This sop to another vulnerable group, however, itself demonstrates the illogic of the ordinance itself. Either we should treat people as they think they are, or we should treat them as biology reveals them to be. It makes no sense to do one sometimes and the other at other times. This reveals the council members, at some basic level, realize biology is important. They just want to imagine it’s not in some cases so they can feel good about having pretended to help people.

Emotion Is Not An Argument

Further, accommodating people’s delusions does not help them. In sane areas of human relationships, we call doing so “enabling.” We even call it enabling when the troubled person we love has a genetic excuse for bad behavior, as do alcoholics and gambling addicts.

People enable because either they feel bad for a troubled friend, or because they do not have the moral strength to provide the tough love and truth-telling he needs. In other words, misplaced emotions and cowardice may be the biggest enemies of true love, which gives a person what he needs, rather than merely what he wants. It’s bad enough in personal relationships when people are not honest with each other or strong enough to help each other through dark days, but it’s absolutely intolerable for public officials to act on such base motivations. For them to pretend their cowardice is actually an act of assistance reveals their willingness to become petty tyrants by inflicting their own personal fantasies upon the populace at large.

We even call it enabling when the troubled person we love has a genetic excuse for bad behavior.

Enabling harmful behavior both hurts the people engaging in it and society at large. McHugh explains the results of doing so for sex-confused patients: “We at Johns Hopkins University…launched a study in the 1970s comparing the outcomes of transgendered people who had the surgery with the outcomes of those who did not. Most of the surgically treated patients described themselves as ‘satisfied’ by the results, but their subsequent psycho-social adjustments were no better than those who didn’t have the surgery. And so at Hopkins we stopped doing sex-reassignment surgery, since producing a ‘satisfied’ but still troubled patient seemed an inadequate reason for surgically amputating normal organs.” He goes on to note that a 30-year 2011 study of 324 people who had sex-change surgery found their likelihood of dying by suicide was almost 20 times that of comparable, non-transgender people. More successful therapies have counseled similarly confused people into accepting biological reality.

It’s now completely taboo to suggest such a thing for other sex-confused people, but given the extraordinarily high amount of self-harming behaviors they exhibit, the compassionate thing to do would pursue any and every therapy that could give troubled people peace. The cruel thing to do is to participate in and perpetuate their fantasy world.

Being Judgmental Is Necessary To Live

One last thing. Proponents of creating special classes of citizens who can scrounge up the political power to get their group legal recognition wish us all to believe another lie: That agreeing with them is necessary if we want to be “non-judgmental” or “anti-discrimination.”

The problem with this is that discrimination is not just good, it is necessary for life.

Everyone judges, and everyone has to. If you are a business owner, you must judge whether a certain applicant for a job will do it well. That means different things for different businesses, but if an employer does not discriminate between hard workers and lazy workers, or qualified workers and unqualified workers, or employees with good interpersonal skills and those who can’t convey basic information, the business will fail. It will provide no one with jobs and no one with services if it doesn’t exist.

The compassionate thing to do would pursue any and every therapy that could give troubled people peace.

We all judge, all the time. I discriminate against people who kiss me, and even free-love people probably do the same. A random person cannot walk up to me at Wal-Mart and smooch. Normal people call that sexual harassment. We all also discriminate against the people who can use our things. It’s not okay for the petty thieves who rifle through my street to find my car keys and take a joy ride. And nobody (except college students) thinks it’s okay to walk into anyone’s house and open the fridge for a snack. I’m going to go out on a limb here and assume almost everyone in the world feels similarly. We’re all food discriminators, car judgers, kiss gatekeepers, and more. And we should be.

There is no way to live without discriminating, except in utter chaos. Even a “non-discrimination” ordinance discriminates, by conveying what city council members consider acceptable behavior and what they do not. All such ordinances do is substitute one judgment about what is appropriate sexual behavior for another, far older, judgment. The LGBTQ lobby sneaks their new judgment past everyone by labeling their discrimination “non-discrimination.” That’s an old trick, called “lying.”

The LGBTQ lobby sneaks their new judgment past everyone by labeling their discrimination ‘nondiscrimination.’

Let’s talk about discrimination honestly. A good way to test a standard is to see if it is fair to both sides. Right now, leftists demand that churches, business owners, schools, and everyone who holds to certain disadvantaged religions be required to implicitly condone behavior their creeds condemn—in many ways, but prominently by being forced to hire folks whose behavior disgraces their employers’ beliefs. Do such mandates, such “non-discrimination” laws, treat both sides equally? When leftists force homosexual business owners to hire people who attend Westboro Baptist Church, we’ll know they’re following the rules they want to force onto everyone else.

Until then, the only logical thing to acknowledge is that the sex-confusion lobby is a bunch of reality-denying hypocrites, and they want to make us all hypocrites whose actions contradict our beliefs rather than fessing up to the truth that theirs don’t fit reality.",https://thefederalist.com/2014/06/19/discrimination-is-healthy-and-normal-sex-confusion-is-not/,2014-06-19
How The Trans-Agenda Seeks To Redefine Everyone,"Did you think only women get pregnant? Or only women get abortions? Planned Parenthood and NARAL—ironically both pro-abortion organizations that self-identify as champions of women’s rights—may soon be trying to change your mind about that.

One signal comes from a little petition drive that goes by #protransprochoice. It urges both Planned Parenthood and NARAL to adopt language more “inclusive” of transgender persons and to acknowledge “gender-non-conforming” people. Both pro-abortion organizations, which have been longtime supporters of the LGBT lobby, tweeted back supportive replies.

So what does this mean and why should we care?

Well, maybe Exhibit A should be Oprah Winfrey introducing us to “the first pregnant man” in 2008. This would be a woman named Tracey who “transitioned” to being Thomas by having a double mastectomy with a dose of hormones to produce facial hair and such. Thomas thought it would be nice to have a baby someday, and so decided to keep “his” vagina, uterus, and ovaries intact. But for some reason, even though Thomas was legally documented as male, she (oops!) needed a sperm donation. (Life isn’t fair.) In any event, when pregnant, Thomas was happy to pose nude (mostly, anyway) for the camera.

Thomas has since had two more children and in 2012 decided to undergo surgery for a more complete transition to a male bodily appearance. She now lectures on “trans fertility and reproductive rights.” Most do not understand what a seismic shift in language is being pushed here. In this scheme of things, using the pronoun “she” to refer to a person who goes through pregnancy and gives birth to a child is grounds for punishment.

Already, there is social pressure for everyone to comply with the gender theory notion that biological facts are mere ‘social constructs.’

So what does it all mean? At root, this isn’t really about people like Thomas. It’s mostly about everybody else. It’s all about changing you and your self-concept. As fringy as they may sound, injecting such lies into our language—“the pregnant man” and the push to separate the word “pregnancy” from the word “woman”—are clear signals that we are moving steadily towards erasing all gender distinctions in the law.

And why should we care? Because erasing gender distinctions, especially as they apply to childbearing and rearing, would serve to legally un-define what it means to be human. A new legal definition of human—as neither male nor female—would apply to you whether you like it or not. Already, there is social pressure for everyone to comply with the gender theory notion that biological facts are mere “social constructs.”

We should especially care because we are well on the way to enacting such laws already. In November, the U.S. Senate voted in favor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA). The law is based on the assumption that one’s perceived “gender identity” does not always “match” your sex “assigned” or “designated” at birth. So, the thinking goes, the law should allow a more ambiguous array of gender identities: male, female, both, neither, or something else entirely. It’s not an overstatement to say that ENDA is a huge step, mostly under the radar, to codify a new definition of humanity.

It’s all about changing you and your self-concept.

In the Senate, every Democrat and ten Republicans voted for ENDA: Senators Ayotte, Collins, Flake, Hatch, Heller, Kirk, McCain, Murkowski, Portman, and Toomey. So all that remains is for the House of Representatives to take up ENDA (which hasn’t happened just yet) and follow suit.

(I have a modest proposal. If and when ENDA is taken up by the House of Representatives, members might consider proposing an amendment that allows equal treatment for a neglected category of oppressed: those who suffer from discrimination based upon age identity. It would simply extend the logic of gender identity laws. You can read more here at The Federalist: “If We Can Pick Our Gender, Can We Pick Our Age?”)

It’s About Control, Not Rights

The transgender movement has strong totalitarian overtones that Americans (especially certain senators) don’t fully understand. How else to describe a crusade with such far-reaching consequences for First Amendment rights? The legal destruction of gender distinctions will inevitably dissolve family autonomy, thereby uprooting freedom of association. Free expression becomes “hate speech” if one doesn’t fall into line with the directives of the transgender lobby or its pronoun protocol. Freedom of religion takes a direct hit any way you look at it.

Under the guise of “rights,” the transgender movement can serve as convenient cover for consolidating and centralizing power under an ever-expanding State. Once we allow the State to refuse to recognize that children result from the male-female union, we grant the State more power to separate us from our children. As power becomes more centralized in the State, the individuals and institutions of the State, inevitably flawed, end up owning our personal relationships. With weakened mediating institutions—family, churches, private associations—we lose the buffer zones that stand between individuals and an encroaching state.

Free expression becomes ‘hate speech’ if one doesn’t fall into line with the directives of the transgender lobby or its pronoun protocol.

Contrary to popular belief, this push to eliminate distinctions of sex from law and replace them with variable and sundry perceptions of gender does not do what it promises. It doesn’t simply provide us with a panoply of gender identities from which we can choose, like the 50-something identities available on Facebook Rather, it’s the setup for a gender vacuum. As you enter this vacuum of gender-neutrality, less and less separates and protects you from the State.

Let’s think this through a bit more. If gender distinctions are erased in law, all marriage will become legally obsolete. The elites pushing same-sex “marriage” have known this all along. If you thought it was really marriage equality they were after, see point three in this Federalist article, “Bait and Switch.”

If we agree to change language to suit the transgender lobby, we ultimately agree to destroy in law the entire basis (sex distinctions) for the only union that can result in autonomously formed families. The implications for privacy and personal relationships are vast, and we need to understand that.

Under the guise of ‘rights,’ the transgender movement can serve as convenient cover for consolidating and centralizing power under an ever-expanding State.

If you think you’ll be able to cultivate and preserve strong personal relationships in this new matrix, you are mistaken. That can’t easily happen in a system in which your familial relationships are not acknowledged or respected by the State. This gender-neutral scheme obliterates the template for the family as a unit. And if the family is no longer accepted as a union that originates through the union of male and female, there is no real basis for the State to recognize any family as an autonomous unit. Without any such obligation, children become more easily classified as state property and our personal relationships are more easily controlled by the state. If that sounds totalitarian, that’s because it is.

The legal erasure of gender distinctions, especially as they relate to the conception, gestation, and birth of children, would effectively cut us off from our spouses and children in the eyes of the law. How can it be otherwise? Yeah, maybe in the bargain we’ll retain the right to “freely” call ourselves male, female, or other. But once we’ve in essence sold our birthright, this is nothing more than a bowl of pottage.

Where Are We Now?

While Americans have been distracted by same-sex “marriage,” transgender activists have been quietly changing laws all across the nation to redefine humanity on their terms. In fact, the enactment of gender identity laws has in many cases outpaced same-sex marriage legislation. So far they’ve passed in 18 states, the District of Columbia, and about 150 municipalities

But now the “transgender revolution” is going on offense. In the past few weeks, a virtual blitzkrieg of drag has rained down upon us from the media. Here are just a few items in the lineup:

It’s ironic that those leading the charge for the transgender revolution would claim there is only one right side to history. Nevertheless, none of this should surprise anyone who has been paying attention. The whole movement has been prepped by the push for genderless marriage. The Supreme Court’s Winsdor decision last year, and its consolidation by activist judges striking down state laws on marriage, has been the cue the transgender movement has been waiting for.

After all, the “T for Transgender” in LGBT has been around for decades, custom-built into the LGBT agenda. If you think this is the end of the line, you’re kidding yourself. There is much, much more to come.

How Deep Are We Into This Transgender Thing?

There’s no end in sight. On the surface, the transgender package, with its assortment of gender identities, to many still resembles a fringe movement, or a passing fad. So lots of folks have been duped into thinking that the purpose of it all is to grant equal rights to a minority demographic. But it’s really about changing the language, and thereby redefining us all.

If gender distinctions are erased in law, all marriage will become legally obsolete.

Indeed, “civil rights” is always a nice line. It works well to stop debate. There’s lots of emotional blackmail involved because of the social punishments (labels of “hater” or “bigot”) heaped upon anyone who might question the agenda.

So how might an elite impose “collective belief formation” upon an unwitting public? It’s about marketing, of course, injecting memes (an older term is “hype”) into public discourse in order to build opinion cascades. An interesting academic look at this is in a Stanford Law Review article by Cass Sunstein and Timur Kuran on “availability cascades.” It explains how you can take an implausible idea and make it seem plausible by raising its availability in public discourse. Once you’ve shaped public opinion through all the usual channels—Hollywood, academic, the media, and so on—then the road to public policy has been nicely paved.

Of course, we see these things applied by mass marketers like Oprah Winfrey and talk shows like “The View” that serve to shape and mold and cajole “new ways of thinking” into the mindset of millions of listeners.

The Role of Linguistic Fascism in the Cult of Transgenderism

We can’t underestimate the role of the language police in forcing compliance with any agenda that hides under the “civil liberties” claim.

Transgender advocacy groups seem to hold very high and specific requirements and expectations from the public and media in terms of how they expect to be understood and talked to. GLAAD’s Media Advisory Guide contains a long checklist of “do’s and don’ts” when one is talking to or referring to a transgender person. Pronouns, of course, are a very touchy subject. Other lists are put out by various advocacy groups, including Transgender Equality, the Human Rights Campaign, Gender Spectrum, and a Cal Berkeley group, to name but a very few.

Forcing changes in our language forces changes in our thoughts.

These convoluted lexicons foisted upon a docile public are daunting. And they’re no doubt meant to be. Interestingly, use of such linguistic gymnastics happens to be an essential device in teasing out a cult mindset.

Margaret Thaler Singer, an expert on cults, has written about the role of rhetoric in stifling independent thinking among cult members: “As members continue to formulate their ideas in the group’s jargon, this language serves the purpose of constricting members’ thinking and shutting down critical thinking abilities. . . . . One large international group, for example, has dictionaries for members to use. . . . One can search from term to term trying to learn this new language.”

According to Singer: “Orwell reasoned that if a government could control all media and interpersonal communication while simultaneously forcing citizens to speak in politically controlled jargon, it could blunt independent thinking.”

As we navigate the labyrinths of identity politics, we must never forget that forcing changes in our language forces changes in our thoughts. And in the case of gender identity, this means accepting language that universally redefines—or perhaps more accurately, un-defines—us all.",https://thefederalist.com/2014/06/23/how-the-trans-agenda-seeks-to-redefine-everyone/,2014-06-23
Back to School: When Mr. Reuter Becomes ‘Ms. Reuter’,"In the Washington DC area, back-to-school sales are underway and summer’s about done. Parents’ inboxes and mailboxes fill with newsy “Get ready for another great year!” letters and long shopping lists of supplies from the PTA. and school principal.

The families of Janney Elementary School, a highly rated DC elementary school in the affluent northwest quadrant of the city, recently received a different sort of back-to-school notice (provided to me by a confidential source). Janney’s principal, Norah Lycknell, announced in a July 17 email to the “Janney Community” that the school’s writing inclusion teacher, the former Mr. Robert Reuter, had declared himself transgender and would now be known as “Ms. Rebecca Reuter (Ms. Reuter to our students).” Principal Lycknell described end-of-year meetings in which Mr. Reuter (as he was known then) “bravely” shared his “powerful and personal story” and his plan to transition to a new gender identity.

The principal’s email informs parents that Teacher Reuter’s announcement gave rise to “wise wonderings,” and “months of thought and planning” in consultation with a “wide scope of educators, experts, and partners,” about how the school community should put its values of “equity,” “inclusion,” and “caring” into practice. “[A]ll children and adults in Janney’s community,” says Lycknell, need to know that “they will be embraced regardless of their subtle and explicit identities.”

Case Study in LGBT School Activism

Stripped of its emotional puffery, Lycknell’s email provides a case study of how LGBT activists are foisting ideological conformity on America’s school children, re-educating them in gender and sexuality according to queer theory. Current LGBT campaigns advocate—relentlessly and aggressively—on behalf of “transgender” individuals, portraying them as perfectly normal people whose gender identities just don’t happen to match their “assigned sex” at birth.

Lycknell’s ‘guidelines’ for parents line up with the Left’s orthodoxy. Point by point, they read like a sampler from an “Indoctrination 101” toolkit (officially, “The Welcoming Schools” Starter Kit, peddled to schools across the country by the Human Rights Campaign). And Lycknell demonstrates well how left-leaning, government-funded employees effectively impose LGBT “groupthink” on impressionable schoolchildren and their well-meaning parents, effectively silencing the opposing views of other parents, faith leaders, and the community at large.

Control the Language, Control the Debate

Lycknell’s email insists early on that discussions about gender employ a precise vocabulary. In paragraphs headlined “The Language of Gender Transition” and “Conversations at Home,” she summarizes the Left’s gender propaganda. Two millennia of philosophical, scientific, and religious perspectives simply vanish in Lycknell’s dogmatic presentation of gender as a social construct and gender identity as a feeling-based reality disconnected from a person’s biological sex. Drawing heavily from the Human Rights Campaign’s “Welcoming Schools” project, Lycknell presents queer theory as fact, the sign of an “increasingly diverse and honest world.”

Gender theorists believe that, freed from the confining “gender binary” (male and female categories) of their “assigned” birth sex, transgender individuals can “affirm” their deeply felt authentic identities. Reuter, for example, can affirm her “real” identity through a range of transition options, from “social” (assuming opposite-sex name and appearance) to “medical” (taking opposite-sex hormones in order to affect secondary sex characteristics such hair growth, breast size, and voice pitch) to “surgical” (removing or adding breast tissue, genitalia, and an Adam’s apple).

The Script for ‘Know-Nothing’ Parents

Lycknell reminds parents of the goal—to help children “broadly recognize gender as a continuum with many ways to express oneself as a person.” (How is it that Reuter’s decision to transition gives the public school the right—with taxpayer funds—to impose its preferred viewpoint, that physical sex and gender identity have no intrinsic connection and that “male and female” are junk categories to be replaced by the “gender spectrum”?) Giving children the Left’s “language of sex and gender,” says Lycknell, is “empowering” for them and provides “meaning and context” for schoolwide discussions. Lycknell’s email “strongly recommend[s]” that parents begin now to discuss sex, gender, and gender transitions with their children, to provide “space and time” for them “to safely process what may be a previously unknown way of considering the gradients between sex and gender.” (“Previously unknown” means “newly-invented,” by the way.)

Most parents, even in liberal-leaning upper northwest DC, are probably not well-versed in queer theory. So Lycknell encourages parents to “be comfortable with not knowing…the answer to every question” and to “be transparent about the things you do not yet know, for true inclusion is often about curiosity—being comfortable with seeking answers about the unknown.” Put differently, parents who think they’ve got gender and sexuality figured out, perhaps according to a religious perspective or simple common sense, risk outing themselves as opponents of “true inclusion.” Lycknell advises parents who embrace the “unknown” to “grow your own understanding and…explore the resources provided” in her email. In other words, she’s got the answers for you. The resource list included in Lycknell’s email includes videos and books for adults, children, and teens—all completely one-sided, a string of progressive, LGBT links and resources that admit no alternative points of view.

Lycknell even encourages parents to “rehearse” and “consider scripting” what they tell their children, avoiding the “temptation to introduce history or perceptions that are not yet part of our children’s wonderings.” No surprise here—her email functions as a ready script, with “key terms” defined according to the Left’s dictionary, with no mention of contradictory “history” or “perceptions.”

Schoolroom Indoctrination and the Cult of Experts

After dictating the language of the “dialogue,” and scripting parents to follow her lead, Lycknell’s letter gives the specifics of how Reuter’s “transition” will be handled at school, where students range from four to eleven years of age (pre-K through fifth grade). The school will proactively “reintroduce” Reuter to her current (third grade) and past (fifth grade) students, and use a less formal process to address other students’ questions. “In all settings,” according to Lycknell, “our approach will be similar to the one suggested for conversations at home, focusing on an individual’s story, the language of sex and gender, and an environment that welcomes questions, adjusted to the developmental stages of our students.”

The ever-helpful Lycknell tells parents she is “more than happy” to connect families to the gender identity “experts” that the school has brought on board. These experts, she reassures parents, “are ready to address any question without judgment.”

But the deck is stacked against Janney parents or staff who might be looking for unbiased, sensible advice or for guidance that respects Judeo-Christian moral traditions. Lycknell omits from her email some particularly salient information: she and the recommended experts are personally and professionally invested in LGBT causes. Lycknell is a lesbian who “married” her partner in a Canadian ceremony in 2008. Her designated experts include Khadijah Tribble, a lesbian activist, Diana Bruce, a “Shero of the Movement” award winner (given to DC “lesbian, bisexual and transgender women” who advance the LGBT cause), and a social worker, Michael A. Giordano, who self-identifies as “a cisgender, kink and poly aware therapist” with an interest in “leather.”

Giordano, a gender identity specialist, deserves special mention. Parents ought to know he thinks that, “Queer is, indeed, the new Cool.” He also believes morality is “subjective” and that folks who are “transgender, bisexual, lesbian, or gay or others trying to accept their interest in polyamory or BDSM [kinky sex] and other kinks” are “good, moral people.” In fact, “their gender identity, sexual orientation, patterns of love, or sexual desires have nothing to do with morality. They just ‘are.’”

It’s true Giordano is a recognized expert—he’s scheduled to speak at next week’s Sexual Freedom Summit, a national event that promotes “sexual freedom” as “one of the highest human aspirations and the foundation of all human rights, the cornerstone for all our civil liberties…[a] source and prerequisite for much, if not all, that motivates human beings.” (The Summit’s sponsors include the usual lefty heavyweights: the International Planned Parenthood Federation and leading LGBT and sexuality organizations.)

A post on Giardano’s blog offers his take on gender identity—and a glimpse of the ideology flourishing at Janney Elementary. Giordano writes:

So what is a real man?…If you identify as a man—you are a man. Men look and act in many different ways and experience all the range of emotions. They have all kinds of hobbies, from sewing to hockey. Some have penises. Some don’t. Some have always been seen by others as men. Others used to live life as girls. My proposal is that we accept this and move on.

This, in effect, is what Janney Elementary is saying to parents: Get with the program, fundamental transformation in process.

Major Questions Entirely Unanswered

But the school leaves major questions unanswered; what Lycknell doesn’t say about Reuter’s transition is almost as instructive as what she does say.

The principal’s email, for example, says nothing about bathroom and locker room issues. Will the former Mr. Reuter share a bathroom with young girls, female teachers or female staff? How does the Janney administration plan to respect the feelings and privacy of all members of its community?

Will parents be consulted about Reuter’s assignments, or have the opportunity to request a different placement for their child if they believe daily interaction with the transitioning Reuter will be confusing or upsetting to their child? Last year, for example, then-Mr. Reuter coached the boys’ fourth-grade basketball team. Will the new Ms. Reuter coach the boys? Will Ms. Reuter have responsibility for other activities or clubs?

Will Reuter undergo merely a “social transition” or more extensive medical or surgical changes? During the medical transition phase, Reuter is likely to retain certain male secondary sex characteristics, at least for a while, but wants to be called “she” and, presumably, plans to wear female clothing. How will the school respect the naturally ambivalent—but politically incorrect—feelings that some children may have towards Reuter? Will children be expected to override any natural confusion, discomfort, or wariness that results from seeing their male teacher decked out as a woman, or from observing the incongruence between facial hair and lipstick, for example?

Does the school’s rush to embrace Reuter’s transition create an unsafe situation by brushing off or stigmatizing the negative feelings some children might experience around Reuter? Child safety protocols teach children to pay attention to their natural instincts and to “tell someone” when they feel uncomfortable in the presence of particular adults. But negative feelings in reaction to Reuter have been invalidated by the Left’s declaration of transgender normalcy. Does the Janney staff expect the youngest students—far too young to process intellectually the concepts of gender transition—to override their interior perceptions that something is not quite right about the apparent Ms. Reuter? When it comes to transgendered persons, will children’s feelings no longer count? Or will children be “re-educated” until they learn to repress, disregard, or change those feelings?

What if a child has an “Emperor’s New Clothes” moment, shouting out something like, “That’s not a lady. That’s a man.” Will ‘the powers that be’ discipline or “re-educate” the little tyke (will counseling be required?) until such transparently correct but politically unpalatable thoughts are banished forever?

These questions are not yet part of the public discussion. In fact, public discussion of the situation is clearly frowned upon at Janney Elementary. Lycknell writes of the need to balance “a larger conversation” with Reuter’s “privacy,” but wants to limit “these conversations” to the school’s planned meetings with students and “direct communication,” as needed, between individual parents and the school’s professional “experts.” As a result, Lycknell discourages Janney parents from using “listservs or similar public forums” to discuss the situation, lest the open forum “deteriorate this balance.”

There’s no doubt Lycknell runs a tight ship. But on this issue, her tight control and soft coercion are creating an intimidating, potentially hostile environment for families that hold time-honored, well-reasoned beliefs about the integral connection between a person’s biological sex and gender identification and the unity of the person (body and soul).

Who wants to be the lonely parental voice contesting the school’s wholesale adoption of the Human Rights Campaign’s “language of sex and gender,” presented as “fact” by the lesbian principal and her gender “experts”? (Especially when there’s little chance parental complaints would receive a fair hearing.) Parents will have reason to fear that if they teach their child traditional views of sex and gender, then their child will face name-calling, labeling (“bigot”), or retaliation, in light of the “overwhelming…support already expressed for Ms. Reuter” by the Janney school community.” And Lycknell’s orchestration of the community “dialogue” on gender effectively deprives parents who disagree with her of any voice in the matter, leaving them to wonder how a man whose views on sex, gender, polyamory, and kinky sex are so far outside the mainstream became the school’s go-to expert on gender identity. Even LGBT-supportive parents ought to be up in arms over the school’s suppression of open discussion.

And suppression it is. “Sit down and shut up, please” seems to be the message at Janney Elementary. (It’s a polite school.) The guardians of tolerance can’t tolerate dissent—or even a few tough questions.

Rolling Stone Discovers That Everyone Homeless Is Gay,"A new feature in Rolling Stone investigates the growing number of religious parents who are condemning their sons and daughters to life on the streets. “The Forsaken: A Rising Number of Homeless Gay Teens Are Being Cast Out by Religious Families,” offers plenty of heartbreaking stories to make its case. But what really caught my eye were all the enormous numbers the author throws around.

Take, for instance, this paragraph:

Highly religious parents are significantly more likely than their less-religious counterparts to reject their children for being gay – a finding that social-service workers believe goes a long way toward explaining why LGBT people make up roughly five percent of the youth population overall, but an estimated 40 percent of the homeless-youth population. The Center for American Progress has reported that there are between 320,000 and 400,000 homeless LGBT youths in the United States.

How could that be?

According to a report by the Department of Housing and Urban Development – which calculates homeless data by using numbers from U.S. shelters, which report on how many people are staying in their facilities and how many were turned away –there were 610,042 homeless on any given night in the United States in 2013, a drop of almost 4 percent from the year earlier. So does that mean that more than half of all homeless are gay teens?

Actually no, because within that 610,042 homeless, 222,197 were members of a family unit staying together. So if we were to simply take the assertion offered in Rolling Stone without context, we would have to accept that nearly every unattached homeless person was an estranged LGBT youth. Obviously, that can’t be right.

Well, the Center for American Progress study mentioned in Rolling Stone piece –which is itself just an aggregation of a few other studies – concedes that any measurement of the homeless youth population in the United States is unreliable, but puts the population anywhere between 1.6 million and 2.8 million. So, the entire population of Nevada or Kansas. That’s a lot of people.

How did they land on this number? Most of the studies used by CAP measure the this population by adding up everyone who has been homeless for at least one night at some point within the past 12 months. Obviously, it’s a disaster for many of those kids, but it’s also a preposterous way to measure the impact of homelessness in general. A kid running away from home for one night, or even for one week, does not face the same struggles as someone who is chronically homeless.

It’s also worth mentioning that 90 percent — seven of ten in one study – of those who were homeless were 18 to 24 years old. I certainly don’t think that’s ok, but it would be absurd not to mention that there’s a difference between a 12-year-old runaway and 20 year old. Unless, of course, you were attempting to overstate the depth of the problem.

And how about these odious “highly religious” parents? Though it is undoubtedly a problem – and considering what I saw growing up, it’s doubtful to me that the problem is just with “religious” parents – there’s absolutely no evidence in this piece that there is new epidemic of exiled gay kids. The author claims that “one study estimates that up to 40 percent of LGBT homeless youth leave home due to family rejection.” The only report I could find that makes any analogous claim is a decidedly unscientific study offered by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Foundation, which asserts that the number of kids pushed from home for being gay could be anywhere between 20 and 40 percent.

For the most part, both the studies and the piece argue that since more kids are coming out earlier, more fundamentalists are throwing them out. This might be true, though I’m skeptical. It’s equally true, I think, to say that more people are accepting of gay kids than when I was young.

Years ago, the CDC was throwing around imaginary numbers to scare people about obesity, double-counting deaths – a person would die from obesity and lung cancer and be counted twice. I attempted to add all the death totals from all the chilling studies that were around warning us about all sort of killers – salt, second-hand smoke, fatty foods, sugar, etc. Soon enough I had surpassed the total of all Americans that had died in that year. That didn’t mean that obesity wasn’t a problem for some. It means that advocates will often say anything to get attention and that outlets like Rolling Stone will publish anything that feeds their preconceived notions about the world.

What It’s Like To Face The LGBT Inquisition,"On the night of October 3, 2014, I was still recovering from a successful launch of a scholarly institute devoted to advancing children’s rights around the globe. The event went up without a hitch in Simi Valley. One hundred and twenty of my students had produced 80 research exhibits drawing from antique literature to give context to a discussion about the history of “family.”

In my life as a scholar, I had struggled to arrive at a moment such as this. Scholars come from somewhere. Growing up the awkward Latino child of lesbians in the uncharitable milieu of 1970s Buffalo, I overcame racism and sexual prejudice all my life with literary craft, reading and writing, witticisms, and intellectual adventures. The bigots who scrawled “SPIC” on the chalkboard when I was at school and threw homophobic slurs at me could not trespass on my sacred ground: Nihil humanum mihi alienum puto, wrote the great poet Terence. Nothing that is human is foreign to me. The world, with its splendiferous cultures and deliciously capricious languages, belonged to me, as long as I was reading and writing.

People with literary inclinations are always whimsical, experimental, even a little reckless. Long ago, the heroes whom I chronicled in my monograph, The Colorful Conservative: American Conversations with the Ancients from Wheatley to Whitman, engaged in all the dangerous flirtation with new ideas that I would find irresistible. Phillis Wheatley rearranged the ideas of Horace; Thoreau subverted Homer; Whitman toyed with Virgil; William Wells Brown reinvented Cato. For most of my life I have aspired to be like these independent thinkers.

Can’t We Ask Questions and Explore Ideas?

But it was really only at the October 3 event that my life as a scholar came full circle. Tenured, well-published, and connected to international allies who could give me a serious chance at disseminating my commitment to the rights of children, I felt I could address a serious gap in research—the question of whether gay parenting as it has evolved is ethical—through the mix of testimonial sincerity and scholarly rigor that I felt had been missing for over 20 years.

I felt I could address a serious gap in research—the question of whether gay parenting as it has evolved is ethical—through a mix of testimonial sincerity and scholarly rigor.

My scholarship and pedagogy have always drawn liberally from the work of Michel Foucault, who argued for studying, not prevailing trends, but the “discontinuity” or “rupture” in idea formations. One gift from Foucault to me was interdisciplinarity and contrarianism, as well as a fervent transnational and multilingual ethos. Breaking outside of patterns, I learned from him, was key to freeing people from the powerlessness of paradigms imposed on them by others. For this reason, when I delivered a speech at Stanford University on April 5 as part of my efforts to move children’s rights scholarship in a new direction, I made Foucauldian anaylsis the centerpiece of my talk.

The fruition of years of refining different perspectives on children’s rights came in that October conference, where experts in the fields of third-party reproduction, divorce law, and adoption—Alana Newman, Jennifer Lahl, Jennifer Roback-Morse, Claudia Corrigan D’Arcy, and Cathi Swett—delivered multidisciplinary feminist readings of children’s rights before a pavilion where my students’ 80 research exhibits were displayed.

We’ll Tell You How to Feel

The conference was consciously not structured as a rebuttal of gay parenting, and that made me very happy. For too long, an overemphasis on statistics and excessive pressure from the gay lobby had skewed scholarship on children. One of my biggest complaints coming out of the Mark Regnerus firestorm of 2012 was that the social sciences had been given free reign to dictate to children raised by same-sex couples how they were supposed to feel.

I was arguing not only against an individual who was telling me that I had no right to feel as I did about being deprived of a father, but also against a technocratic, deeply anti-humanist philosophy that felt comfortable reducing the higher aims of life to statistics.

Oftentimes when I was interviewed or when I debated, people would tell me, “But, Mr. Lopez, all the social science indicates that children do just as well in same-sex households.” Citations of the American Pediatric Association or the American Medical Association typically ensued. As a humanities professor, I faced a conundrum: I was arguing not only against an individual who was telling me that I had no right to feel the way I actually did about being deprived of a father; I was also arguing against a technocratic, deeply anti-humanist philosophy that felt comfortable reducing the higher aims of life to statistics. And we all know what Mark Twain had to say about statistics.

So all that was behind me and I was in an exhilarated mood by Monday, October 6, when I faced a crushing blow at work. I arrived at the office to discover that untold hundreds of people in my office had received an email overnight, which had actually been sent by the nation’s largest gay rights organization to more than a million people. Here is what the email said:

I saw, in an instant, a whole life of scholarship go up in smoke. Many of my students had gotten some version of this message by mid-morning; they were visibly furious that I had, in their minds, tricked them in some way. Did I have them spend so many hours of research on those exhibits just to advance an “anti-gay” agenda? They asked me directly, and I had to explain what was going on in shaken class discussions where all the focus on our collective accomplishment as humanities scholars faded before the exact thing I had tried to avoid: the reductive, mind-numbing, platitudinous debate about “pro-gay” versus “anti-gay” moral attitudes.

Ty Cobb’s email exemplifies everything that is wrong with present-day scholarship. Whole careers can be reduced, through selective quoting and willful misrepresentations, to sound bytes that destroy people’s careers. The scholar himself, in my shoes, is powerless, lacking a megaphone loud enough or the funds to refute point by point all the lies and deceptions in campaigns of character assassination.

Let’s Get Some Facts Straight

I have never been a member of the World Congress of Families, and had nothing to do with a petition forwarded to Griffin on that group’s behalf. I am classified as an “exporter of hate” by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) because I critique an array of parenting arrangements that happen to include same-sex parenting, I speak foreign languages, and I travel outside the United States. But notice how this email implies that the quote attributed to me was delivered somehow in conjunction with my travel overseas, and that this travel was connected in some way to my job.

I want to frame the discussion not as a gay issue but rather as a children’s issue, and that I wish to criticize gay and straight people equally for offenses against children’s rights.

I have traveled to Great Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium as part of my research and activism on children’s rights. That is how I built the advisory boards for my institute and made them international in scope. The other countries listed in Cobb’s email—Russia, Uganda, etc.—are places whose laws I have repudiated publicly and which I have never visited.

The quote attributed to me in Cobb’s email came from this blog post. If you read through the post and then see the quote, it will become immediately obvious that the quote is not anti-gay and I am not anti-gay. Most of the article was about my struggles as a queer soldier serving in the military during the debate about “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell,” my concern for the safety of gay men with the high rate of military rapes, and my conviction that we need more thorough debate and discussion about the implications of new family structures for children. It is clear in that post that I want to frame the discussion not as a gay issue but rather as a children’s issue, and that I wish to criticize gay and straight people equally for offenses against children’s rights.

But in a paragraph, with a sound bite, and an email blast, a scholar’s world can come crashing down. My wife went into labor that afternoon as I stood before 30 of my students struggling to explain to them why they just found out their professor was high on a gay rights organization’s enemy list.

As I rushed to the hospital and tried to put this out of my mind, for the sake of my newborn son, I felt the four corners of the world closing in on me. There seemed no way out of an intellectual trap. Cobb is willing to eradicate the particulars of genre and the mise-en-scène of quotes taken out of context. He is also utterly comfortable engaging in blatant deception, making it seem as though I stated that quote in a country like Uganda at an event organized by the World Congress of Families. The HRC profile on me tells readers that I delivered speeches in Minnesota and France, but then quotes obscure blog posts I wrote as a kind of brainstorming. They refuse to show my actual words from the statements in either place, for readers would see that my tone was temperate and cautious about balancing gay rights with the rights of children.

The LGBT Lobby Hates Intellectual Trust-Busting

They are targeting me because I am a scholar, a translator, a writer, a speaker, a professor. People who travel to other countries, speak to foreigners in other languages, and read many kinds of literature endanger their monopoly on American discourse. They need platitudes to paper over people’s doubts. They need silence for their demands to go unchallenged. As I elaborated in a piece for American Thinker, this means, effectively, that scholarship itself threatens them.

There is no way for one lone scholar to prevail against full-time investigators paid by a massive lobbying organization to comb over that scholar’s work in search of embarrassing quotes.

Which brings me to my point. Under these conditions, research will die soon. Maybe it is already dead. Scholars cannot forge new ideas if they are punished for writing too much, publishing too much, considering too many ideas. There is no way for one lone scholar to prevail against full-time investigators paid by a massive lobbying organization to comb over that scholar’s work in search of embarrassing quotes. If every sentence must be written with safeguards against misquoting and interpretive abuse, then every scholarly study will sound the same, argue the some points, and support the same conclusion. That is how the field of sociology arrived at its now famous “consensus” about same-sex parenting, which Loren Marks deconstructed in 2012.

If people cease to take thinking seriously, the LGBT lobby wins. The cost of their victory will be, tragically, far more than the many careers and personal lives they destroyed in the effort to, as Josh Barro put it, “stamp out” dissenters. The cost will be the great marketplace of ideas that nourished scholarship since the days of Socrates and long before.

Why Singles Rights And Same-Sex Marriage Will Abolish All Marriage,"Americans are generally people of goodwill who try to keep the golden rule. I think that’s why the term “equality” has such resonance for so many of us. But as we move farther down the path called “marriage equality,” I believe a greater dose of skepticism is in order by all freedom-loving Americans, whatever their perspective on the issue.

That’s because one particular cross-current rooted in the same-sex marriage movement promises to dominate the aftermath, shift us all away from the idea of freedom to marry, and place us all into system more akin to hard left central planning. It’s a little movement that goes by the moniker “singles’ rights” or sometimes “unmarried equality.”

Let’s not fall into a trap here. We need to think this through.

The Confession

I recently argued in The Federalist that same-sex marriage is merely a vehicle to abolish all civil marriage, and with it, all family autonomy. I predicted that “singles’ activists” would try to finish the job by using those same “marriage equality” arguments to claim that all civil discriminates against singles and therefore should be abolished. Lo and behold, a singles’ activist, author of the book “Singlism,” and blogger for Psychology Today, Bella DePaulo, confirmed exactly that in her critique of my Federalist article, “Welcome to Selfie Nation.” Here’s what she said: “Morabito says that what I really want is ‘to abolish marriage without saying so.’ That’s not quite right. I’m happy to say so.”

‘Morabito says that what I really want is “to abolish marriage without saying so.” That’s not quite right. I’m happy to say so.’

DePaulo seems to have hedged on this before, not going so far as to say outright that civil marriage should be abolished. Instead, in 2012 she picked up on Elizabeth Blake’s argument that marriage should be “minimized.” But perhaps with the Supreme Court’s recent decision to expand same-sex marriage, that façade doesn’t seem to need so much propping up any more. So DePaulo is “happy to” fess up now and say, yes, her movement definitely wants all marriage abolished.

As for me connecting “singles’ rights” with the same-sex marriage movement, DePaulo had this to say by way of confirmation:

The author picks up on an argument I have been making for some time – that single people are targets of institutionalized, legalized discrimination in the form of the 1,000+ federal laws that protect and benefit only those who are legally married. She also accurately notes that my argument, and that of many other like-minded critics, has roots in the same-sex marriage movement.

It’s a significant admission. So marriage supporters and activists out there, could you please take note and pursue this line? If a little coterie of activists who claim to speak for all singles gets its way, the Supreme Court may soon consider declaring all marriage unconstitutional.

That is the whole point of same-sex marriage, at least as far as such singles’ activists–and likely most LGBT activists—are concerned: to lay the groundwork for abolishing it altogether. And with it, all family autonomy and family privacy will have to go. Whether you are a left-wing true believer in central planning and control, someone who has accepted the mantra of “marriage equality” for same -marriage, or someone who has accepted the final step of this strange journey—that married “privilege” should be abolished—the path will be set and the outcome will be the same.

Let’s Clarify Reality

The arguments I make for marriage and family are straightforward, even plain. Central planners have always understood that when you legally isolate people, you can better control them. Take away the sanctuaries of marriage and family, and you take away everybody’s privacy and autonomy. The state zooms into that vacuum.

Telling someone they’re ‘afraid of single people’ is like telling them they’re afraid of people with arms or people who walk.

Now, I do understand that DePaulo is deeply invested in her quest to abolish marriage in the guise of singles’ rights. So I imagine that’s why she did not respond to my central argument that it is bad for the state to completely disregard family bonds, and thereby legally isolate each and every individual, single and married alike, from the autonomous sanctuary of families.

Instead, DePaulo sums up her response to me in a very strange way: by claiming I am “afraid” of single people. Whenever a critic has to resort to an ad hominem fallacy—especially such a ridiculously offbeat one—well, you know you’re definitely on to something. At first, I thought it was kind of funny, even if outlandish. I mean, telling someone they’re “afraid of single people” is like telling them they’re afraid of people with arms or people who walk. It’s an eye-roller, a silly charge to respond to.

Nevertheless, it’s always disturbing to see someone project emotions onto the messenger of an intellectual argument rather than just answer the points. And who exactly are these “single people” of DePaulo’s imagination? I see us all as unique human beings, diverse in our perspectives. She sees “single people” as . . . . what? A monolithic political bloc, perhaps.

DePaulo’s apparent claim to speak for an entire demographic is another red flag. Recall, for example, how Lenin said he spoke for the proletariat, as their vanguard. Mao spoke for the peasantry, as their vanguard. And so on. Once you’ve wrapped yourself in the mantle of “the people” or “singles” or whomever, it is far too easy to lapse into accusing those who oppose your agenda of being against “the workers” or “the people” or “single people” or whomever. It is, in essence, a smear tactic that enables its users to avoid engaging with real arguments. And we all know it happens on every level: in middle school cafeterias, in homeowner’s associations, in office politics, in faculty lounges, in Politburos.

Abolishing Marriage Would Further Empower Central Planners

But the bottom line is that singles’ activists are poised to be handed the “marriage equality” baton by LGBT activists so they can use it to fight for “unmarried equality.” In the end, this basically means keeping singles single and making marrieds single, too.

The effort to abolish marriage is intimately connected to the ongoing radical redefinition of family.

Too many Americans seem hypnotized by the slogan that abolishing civil marriage will “get the state out of the marriage business.” No. It sure as heck won’t. Have you ever heard anyone who makes this claim explain exactly how it gets the state “out”? I haven’t, and I’ve concluded that’s because it does no such thing. Rather, by abolishing marriage, you simply give the state permission to refuse to recognize your marriage, and its attendant rights and responsibilities. This refusal inevitably extends to the rest of family relationships, including parent-child.

Thus, the effort to abolish marriage is intimately connected to the ongoing radical redefinition of family. All of this is about—whether consciously and willfully, or not—abolishing family autonomy, abolishing privacy, and, by logical extension, abolishing all personal relationships based on mutual trust. If there is no legally protected autonomy in the family, how can it exist in any other personal relationship? It can’t. By abolishing marriage, we all become strangers to one another in the eyes of the state. Statists have always salivated at the prospect of regulating all of our personal relationships, all of our social interactions. This is not good.

These Problems Aren’t Single People’s Fault

DePaulo goes on in her blog to mangle, distort, and misinterpret so much of my writing in so many ways that I cannot possibly address them all here. (But you can check my blog post here for more.) For example, I expressed concern about the breakdown of family bonds and how that affects social trust and a sense of community. She claimed this meant I thought “single people” were responsible for all of that. Are you kidding me? Singles aren’t a monolithic group even capable of such a thing. Maybe DePaulo thinks so. But I don’t.

My point about the breakdown of trust and community and family bonds is that it’s a vicious human cycle due to a complex array of factors and pressures. When human bonds weaken, so does trust. And when trust weakens, so do human bonds. There is a correlation between a growing sense of isolation and alienation in a society and the breakdown of bonds of personal and family intimacy. (But if I were forced to assign blame to any specific “group” of people I’d sooner consider married folks with kids who casually divorce than I would single people.) There are so many forces that separate people—coarse commercialism, economic pressures, status anxiety, the divorce culture, educational disparities, to name a very few.

Pious Baloney about Community Involvement



I must admit, I chuckled to see DePaulo’s channeling of Newt Gingrich at one point, when she called my connection of children to state interest in marriage “pious bologna” [sic]. I’ll raise her ten Newts on that. (Check my blog here for more.)

We can explore issues of community engagement without pitting one group of people against another.

DePaulo carried on about “findings” (for which she provided no citations), that showed singles being far more community engaged than married people. While surveys do tend to show what you’d expect, that single people have more time for and thus engage in volunteering and other visible community activities, it’s also true that communities with higher numbers of married people as a whole have more civic engagement and economic mobility. And, obviously, married people keep themselves busy improving each other’s lives and the lives of their children, which doesn’t “count” as community involvement on some measures but clearly should.

Community is far more than what you see on the surface in public spaces. Even if DePaulo is correct to say that singles take more art and music classes, engage in more civic events, keep the cities more vibrant, or call their parents more often than marrieds do, I think we can explore issues of community engagement without pitting one group of people against another. I think it “counts” when married parents expend so much life-consuming energy on the raising of children. It “counts” when married people contribute energy to scout troops, kids’ sports leagues, school events, or churches.

Family Intimacy Breeds Trust

In the end, it helps to recognize that cultivating strong lifelong relationships, especially family intimacy, pays huge dividends for all of society. It breeds trust in others, and social trust has been plummeting over the past several decades, as the General Social Survey recently noted.

The healthy intimacy within families—with or without children—begets trust, security, and well-being.

DePaulo complains that married people are “insular.” Perhaps what she means in part is that they are intimate, and therefore not as attentive to the community activities she’d like to see them more engaged in. Intimacy does, by definition, require a certain degree of privacy and prioritizing for relationships to grow and develop. But intimacy breeds trust, and that’s ultimately good for communities.

The healthy intimacy within families—with or without children—begets trust, security, and well-being. Organic marriage serves as the most reliable forge for such things, especially because it’s within that relationship that future citizens most readily come into being. It’s in that context that citizens (while they are young) are most able to feel a level of unobstructed commitment and intimacy as nothing else in the public or private sphere can give them. With the stability and trust imbued in them, everybody benefits. So we need to recognize marriage, not obstruct it, because it keeps society healthy when that sense of goodwill and trust in people is then broadcast back out to the community by both married and single adults.

When The Queer Stepfords Come To Catholic U,"We recently made two presentations at Catholic University in Washington DC: one on the importance of children’s rights and considering more than statistics to understand them; the other on the importance of resisting totalitarian silencing tactics and the hijacking of civil discourse.

Then the questions began. We got two general patterns of questions:

A lot of dubious statistics that had little or nothing to do with the presentation (for instance, an LGBT meme claiming 40 percent of homeless teens are gay, which isn’t relevant to the central point that children have a right to be born free and know their origins). Totalitarian silencing tactics and the hijacking of civil discourse

Our night ended with a group of white men chanting at a queer of color and a female: “racist, sexist, antigay! Christian fascists, go away!”



That was the night. Yeah, really.

Forget the International Day of the Child

Okay, maybe you want more details. It was the International Day of the Child, a day established in the 1950s by the beloved United Nations to remember the rights of children. November 20 was also—as someone in the audience reminded—International Transgender Remembrance Day, a day founded a few years ago to talk about the fraction of less than 0.1 percent of 0.1 percent of 0.1 percent of 0.1 percent of human beings who are allegedly killed just for being transgender. Proportionality seems to have gone out the window due to the irony of a small group of activists obsessed with gender transitioning who hijacked a day that was established to observe the rights of every young human being ever born (or ever died.)

Social scientists have a strong tendency to come up with statistics supporting policies that fail on humanitarian grounds.

Children’s rights advocate Robert Oscar Lopez addressed the small group about the recent history of a new children’s rights movement. It’s based on pushing back against the artificial reproductive technologies lobby, certain exploitative and lucrative adoption lobbies, and the gay and lesbian lobby, all of which seek to make it easier to buy biomaterials or children in order to meet a market demand for kids.

Bobby, who happens to be a professor of English literature, began by talking about an academic dilemma: social scientists have a strong tendency to come up with statistics supporting policies that fail on humanitarian grounds. For instance, in the social sciences, statistics are used to claim children do just as well with or without relationships to their biological parents. Yet we know from vast reams of literature and human experience that children feel an intense longing to know who they come from. This reality should not be dismissed just because it is not quantifiable.

According to Bobby, the solution to this problem in discourse is to focus more on the humanities, especially integrating perspectives from literature, law, history, and philosophy. He played a slide show featuring 80 photos of research galleries about great literature in the past from Ovid to Hawthorne, narratives about the timeless yearning people have to connect with their mother and father.

How ‘Stepford Husbands’ Use Human Needs to Quash Dissent

Then came Stella Morabito’s presentation. She applied her expertise in totalitarian thought control regimes and showed how political correctness silences people and blocks folks from speaking openly about children’s rights—or anything else that might be a subject of PC-dictated controversy. The basic idea was that the ability to speak out can conflict with the primal human need to feel connected to others. The threat of being cast out and isolated often determines whether people remain silent or speak up.

Political correctness is all about manipulating the human need for warmth and connection with others by threatening to isolate anyone who doesn’t abide by the PC agenda.

Political correctness is all about cultivating that fear. It’s all about manipulating the human need for warmth and connection with others by threatening to isolate anyone who doesn’t abide by the PC agenda. And PC agendas are nothing more than power-consolidation schemes. They tend to collapse quickly when subject to scrutiny or real debate. So dissenting views must be suppressed for PC agendas to survive. The most effective way to do this is by threatening non-personhood on anyone who doesn’t get with the program. Smears—such as “racist, sexist, anti-gay!”—are intended to produce this effect.

By inducing fear in order to prevent dissent, controllers can manufacture and sustain a spiral of silence. The spiral of silence thus manufactures “public opinion” in a cascade for the power-consolidating agenda. It all culminates in public policy that centralizes power for the dictators of PC agendas.

We might also look at such dictators as “Stepford husbands.” They try to control or “improve” all others as the Stepford husbands of fiction worked to control and “improve” their wives. The wives are programmed to do as they’re told. And to love it. Thus a cult mindset is born. In this way, Stepford-controlled lobbies (such as the Human Rights Campaign, or HRC, and GLAAD) can organize and program many a little army of rainbow-toting robots to go from venue to venue to shout down dissenting views. Sadly, they don’t seem to know how to do anything else.

A Queer Hijacking Begins

We gave our talks without incident, but the rainbows began to show their colors during the question and answer period. None of the critics cared to ask specifically about the material discussed. That’s not surprising, perhaps, because they were way too busy giving us a complimentary dramatization of Stella’s talk about totalitarian silencing tactics. It began with “questions” intended to accuse and smear and which were irrelevant to the discussion at hand.

None of the critics cared to ask specifically about the material discussed.

There were a couple of decent questions, probably from the students who were part of the Anscombe Society, which hosted the event. The Anscombe Society, by the way, is all about standing up for traditional marriage and family. Elizabeth Anscombe, for whom it’s named, was an eminent twentieth-century philosopher and mother of seven. She was a staunch Catholic, too. Oh, did we mention that the talk took place at Catholic University? (Where people likely organized from off-campus feel welcome to shout: “Christian fascists, go away!”)

But for the most part, the LGBT-programmed Stepford students insisted on hijacking the question and answer session, especially pestering Bobby. There was a question on homeless gay kids and other shifts away from the topic at hand. The fellow leading the pack was particularly obsessed with Bobby’s blog, and became angry over an article critical of the Human Rights Campaign (an exclusively LGBT organization) for being akin to a totalitarian organization. And so on.

Now you may well be wondering why imported or coached LGBT activists would want to protest a gathering focused on children’s rights, the dangers of child trafficking, and the silencing of dissent. Two reasons: First, the way this biology thing works, two people of the same sex can never conceive babies on their own. (Yes, that is true.) So the LGBT community is among the most active promoters of practices like renting the wombs of poor third-world women to gestate other women’s eggs that were selected for fertilization or implantation by homosexual couples. This way the birth mother is intentionally not the genetic mother. The problem for children is that such forms of child trafficking intentionally separate them from biological parents.

‘T’ Is for Torquemada

But just as importantly, the LGBT lobby viciously targets individuals who disagree with its dogma. Bobby is a particularly high-value target because he doesn’t fit HRC’s or GLAAD’s (formerly the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) preferred stereotype of someone who stands up for the rights of children to be born free and to know both their mother and father. They see him as a heretic since he is outspoken on this issue, fluent in several languages, and since he was raised by lesbians and identifies as bisexual. (The fact that he is also faithfully married to the mother of his children is another big strike against him.)

The HRC, an organization flush with gazillions in cash and which enjoys enormous influence and protection from President Obama’s White House, cannot abide even one voice of dissent coming from a lone man on an English professor’s salary.

So a couple of months ago the HRC ran a malicious campaign against Bobby, shamelessly profiling him with a “wanted poster” sketch on their blog and stating that he was being put “On notice!” GLAAD added him to their “hate list” last year. It’s really astonishing that the HRC, an organization flush with gazillions in cash and which enjoys enormous influence and protection from President Obama’s White House, cannot abide even one voice of dissent coming from a lone man on an English professor’s salary. In the Torquemada eyes of the HRC and GLAAD, Bobby Lopez is a heretic.

But it was mostly at the end of the Q&A that all hell broke loose. The crashers had spread out, in shill-partnering fashion. Now they came together as a pre-organized pack, complete with flag-waving. They shouted “no platform!” and that Pope Francis would have never allowed such an event to take place (which is interesting, since the Vatican invited Bobby to the Humanum conference that just ended.)

Sadly, the chants, the flags, the shout-downs at the end are truly hallmarks of cult behavior. Such followers are steeped in a culture of grievance that dulls their ability to think through any hard questions of life. Regardless of how they began, the colors of the rainbow flag have all run together into a shade of muddy brown. So we ought to come to terms with the fact that LGBT activists have actually been waving brown shirts at us all along.

"For The West, Christian Hunting Is The Sport Of Lawmakers And Judges","Throwing Christians to the lions to be eaten alive versus forcing them to engage in a series of lawsuits that will devour their financial sustenance or to close shop and remove to a more tolerant jurisdiction are certainly distinct varieties of persecution, and the former much worse than the latter. But both are religious persecution. It seems the West is now determined to hunt down the very religious tradition that has not only sustained but enabled it to vibrantly flourish, all in the name of the equality of man that Christianity was first to declare and establish. In other words, we’re witnessing a slow-moving cultural murder-suicide.

Patrick Reilly of the Cardinal Newman Society discusses in the Wall Street Journal this week only the latest in our recent series of government intrusions upon religion, in the Washington DC City Council’s decision to amend the city’s “Human Rights Act” to require religious K-12 schools and universities to fund and encourage on-campus gay advocacy groups. It is considering another “reproductive health” amendment that

could prevent religious schools from enforcing contracts in which teachers pledge to be moral examples to students and to abide by religious teachings—including teachings against abortion, sterilization or contraception. Proponents and opponents believe this amendment also could be used to force the district’s employers—including religious nonprofits—to cover abortion in employee health plans. That would go a step further than ObamaCare’s mandatory coverage of sterilization and contraception, which has been challenged by 55 lawsuits from religious colleges, charities and other nonprofits.

One wonders in passing why on earth DC’s council would attack schools that rescue so many local children from a positively horrific “public” education system that is an international shame to our country—but perhaps that description of it reveals the answer. More to the point, however, these events are merely the latest to herald the growth of illiberal government. We’re moving from “let your freak flag fly” to “only the freaks we condone are allowed to exist in peace.” Gay freaks are in. Christian freaks are out.

That may have been the goal all along. Remember that the LGBT lobby only asked for “tolerance,” civil unions, and “coexistence” when they were less embedded in the halls of power, less ensconced as keepers of cultural and legal privilege. Now that they are the new dead white guys (an amusing image, really), there’s no such liberality.

We used to hear “how can love between two people harm anyone else?” Now it’s quite clear that the LGBT lobby’s version of love has awfully vicious effects. It apparently motivates them to stamp out the livelihoods and peaceful coexistence of those who dare think differently. If this isn’t the result of hate, it’s certainly a vicious form of reactionary self-righteousness, of the kind they project upon Christianity.

A New Kind of Christian Persecution?

Compared to ancient and contemporary persecution of Christians that involve brutal, direct measures such as beheading, flogging, rape, and child slavery, whittling away the ability of Christians to publicly behave as and acknowledge what their consciences demand is softer; but that does not negate it as genuine persecution or political tyranny. Alexis de Tocqueville might relate this to a similar tyranny of our political sphere, which he called “soft despotism.” This is not the brutal despotism of a Middle Eastern or South American dictator, but of “a network of small, complicated rules” that gently but surely squeeze the life out of a people. From “Democracy In America” (of course):

The will of man is not shattered, but softened, bent, and guided; men are seldom forced by it to act, but they are constantly restrained from acting. Such a power does not destroy, but it prevents existence; it does not tyrannize, but it compresses, enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a people, till each nation is reduced to nothing better than a flock of timid and industrious animals, of which the government is the shepherd.

The effects of such a network of rules are not merely political; they are also spiritual. People will not only be censored and limited by government agencies, but as they navigate this brave new world, they will begin to self-censor and withdraw into themselves to avoid setting off a chain reaction that leads to public unpleasantness. Escapees of totalitarian regimes describe this as the political and spiritual atmosphere of their former homes. People will not only not hire new employees for existing businesses, they will not start new businesses. They not only will not voice their opinion in public spaces, they restrain themselves from voicing it at home, to their families and close friends, and perhaps even to themselves. Schools and other religious institutions may not be able to forthrightly define their criteria for employee behavior, so they must hint at it and hire people through private instead of public channels. People withdraw, and become isolated, both internally and externally.

I turn to Paul Rahe for further explication of these moral effects:

Above all, he was persuaded that where there is centralized administration and individual citizens find themselves alone facing the state, they will succumb to the disposition that Pascal, Montesquieu, and Rousseau had called inquiétude (using a word that has a range of meanings stretching from uneasiness and restlessness to anxiety and outright fear) and, in search of a sense of security, will gradually become passive subjects.

Freedom is not freedom if people are not free to be wrong. It is not freedom if it carries with it no risk, no possibility of failure. People cannot develop new and better ideas if they are not free to experiment, to test the truth and rightness of their present beliefs. So tyranny is not ever just political, but also moral, because what a man may or may not do with his hands and mouth ultimately shapes the habits of his mind and soul.

LGBT activists forcing themselves upon their political opponents are incredibly childish and shortsighted, because they are cutting off entirely the possibility of persuasion, of human and cultural growth, on both sides. They proclaim “diversity,” but clearly do not mean it. Indeed, they are making perhaps the same mistake the Catholic Church did during the Inquisition: assuming that force is not only a just but effective means of persuasion. One wonders why gay activists are so afraid to allow their opponents the freedom to let live.",https://thefederalist.com/2014/12/29/for-the-west-christian-hunting-is-the-sport-of-lawmakers-and-judges/,2014-12-29
Leelah’s Law Is Bad Law And Bad Medicine,"Transgender activists wasted no time politicizing the highly publicized suicide of a transgender youth in Ohio last week. That tragedy is now serving as a pretext for a federal law that would essentially give the state greater control over what people are allowed to say about a child’s gender identity in the therapist’s office, and even in homes and churches.

But this particular suicide seems tailor-made for a media blitz, because the teen’s suicide note contains so many of the talking points of the transgender lobby, including things like:

“I feel like a girl trapped in a boy’s body”

Frustration with family members who question transgenderism

Condemnation of therapists who question transgenderism

Anger towards church

Assertion “the longer you wait the harder it is to transition” suggesting that the age of consent should be lowered

“Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better”

“My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year.”

“Fix society.”

But let’s start by asking the one question anyone interested in reality and truth should: What happened?

A tractor-trailer hit 17-year-old Joshua Alcorn on Interstate 71 at about 2:30 a.m. on December 28, according to Ohio media citing police reports. (Let’s not forget that the individual driving the truck was unwittingly drafted as executioner.) The 900-plus word suicide note left on Alcorn’s Tumblr account (which has since been deleted) was signed with the name “Leelah” in parentheses, like this: “(Leelah) Josh Alcorn.”

Just two months before, Alcorn had expressed a lot of frustration and angst in a Reddit thread. He wrote about his parents’ resistance to his female gender identity, and how they deprived him of Internet access and social companionship outside of church and that this went on for five months. (Whether or not you’d classify that as abuse, I cannot imagine such intense isolation could help any teenager’s depression, whatever its source.)

Alcorn’s grieving mother and father have also been under persistent criticism for referring to Alcorn as their son Joshua instead of as their daughter Leelah, even though they said they never heard any reference to the name Leelah. Most of the media has obeyed the language protocols set up by the well-funded LGBT Lobby watchdogs, particularly GLAAD. (I resist not only out principle and a respect for physical reality, but also because I believe language should evolve through natural usage, not political ambush.)

Is It the Parents or Big Trans Who Have Blood on Their Hands?

What else happened? Well, the rest is an emotional fog. There’ve been candlelight vigils and social media hubbub and lots of mass vilification of the parents who are being blamed for the suicide. But some on the Internet have blamed the suicide on the transgender lobby itself for being manipulative, controlling, and cult-like. Here’s just one example, which comes from “a former trans cult member:”

To trans-activists & DSM-5 shrinks & other medical enablers & all media naturalizers of transgenderism: This.is on you. #LeelahAlcorn



— I Remembered Reality (@genderiswrong) December 31, 2014

Also, there’s this post from a radical feminist blog, which describes trans activists’ reaction to Alcorn’s suicide as ghoulish, claiming those activists actually love any suicide that promotes their agenda. In the meantime, LGBT Demagogue Extraordinaire Dan Savage weighed in heavily by calling for the prosecution of Alcorn’s parents:

#LeelahAlcorn‘s parents threw her in front of that truck. They should be ashamed—but 1st they need to be shamed. Charges should be brought.



— Dan Savage (@fakedansavage) December 31, 2014



He also called for the state to remove Alcorn’s siblings from their parents’ care:

Finally: #LeelahAlcorn has siblings. We don’t leave kids in the care of parents who just killed one of their other children.



— Dan Savage (@fakedansavage) December 31, 2014

Savage says any therapists involved should be charged, too. He essentially prescribes the end of “Christian” counseling, by which we can safely assume he means any counseling that doesn’t come with a Big Dan Savage Seal of Approval:

The “Christian therapists” who counseled #LeelahAlcorn should also be charged. pic.twitter.com/UrxJFuI2jq



— Dan Savage (@fakedansavage) December 31, 2014



In any case, the “Transgender Human Rights Institute” immediately got the ball rolling to promote the idea of a federal law that will do all those things Savage called for. The agenda is embedded in a petition drive on Change.org for “Leelah’s Law to Ban Transgender Conversion Therapy.” Many celebrities have thrown in their support, including Kim Kardashian and Mia Farrow. As of this writing, the petition has around 300,000 signatures.

So what exactly is Leelah’s Law? Well, it’s essentially a pro-censorship law. It’s also bad medicine and not at all pro-child.

Leelah’s Law Is a Pro-Censorship Law

Advocates of Leelah’s Law describe “conversion therapy” as dangerous and harmful and call for a national ban. Certainly, there are cases of psychological abuse out there. But how exactly could the term “conversion therapy” be applied under federal law? Could it mean banning all conversations between a gender dysphoric child and any therapist who is not totally on board with the politics of transgenderism? Does it amount to social engineering through using psychiatry for politics? Well, when you test the logic, it sure sounds like it can’t mean anything else.

In effect, the law would prohibit any questioning from a therapist, or possibly even by the patient in cases, as to whether a child’s gender dysphoria can be treated without prescribing transition to the opposite sex.

The petition doesn’t say what a federal ban on conversion therapy would look like. But you can glance at a California bill that would ban reparative therapy for anyone under the age of 18 who identifies as homosexual for an idea. It basically means that any therapy steering a child from a homosexual to a heterosexual orientation is destructive and therefore a crime. Applied to transgenderism, this would mean the same for any therapy that steers a transgender child toward an identity congruent with their biological sex.

But here are just two things to consider before jumping on board with a federal “Leelah’s Law.” First, it gives government carte blanche to interpret and dictate and define at will what “conversion therapy” means. It empowers the state to arbitrarily punish any counselor or parent or church reported to have supported such counseling. Second, the proposed law is a one-way street and only bans one form of conversion, so it is not truly a ban on conversion therapy. The presumption is that there is not now, nor can there ever be in the future, any attempt to convert a child who is not transgender.

In any event, this looks a lot like a Trojan Horse law. In effect, it prohibits any questioning from a therapist, or possibly even by the patient in cases, as to whether a child’s gender dysphoria can be treated without prescribing transition to the opposite sex. The presumption is that gender identity is set in stone and no dissent is possible once the patient presents as transgender.

So as it inevitably metathesizes, a codified Leelah’s Law would promise to place a chilling effect nationally on cognitive therapy. Parents would have no other legal options but to assume and promote as permanent their child’s gender identity. This has vast implications for family autonomy and relationships.

Leelah’s Law Is Not at All Pro-Child

When you consider how invasive a process it is to physically transition from one sex to the other —adopting behaviors, taking hormones, having surgery in many cases—it’s astonishing that some people would lead any gender nonconforming child down that path without hesitation.

In the vast majority of cases, children who say they’re transgender and act that way change their minds about being the opposite sex—if you just leave them alone.

In the vast majority of cases, children who say they’re transgender and act that way change their minds about being the opposite sex—if you just leave them alone. According to a recent Hastings Center report, gender dysphoria does not persist into adulthood in up to 73 to 94 percent of cases (citing the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, which noted dysphoria continuing in only 6 to 23 percent of boys and 12 to 27 percent of girls.) Here’s just one testimonial on that experience.

But in pop culture today there’s a lot of much nudging and glorifying and special privileges given to boys who say they’re girls and girls who say they’re boys. We’ve become so saturated with these trans fads that it shouldn’t surprise us if we hear choruses of “Me too! Me too!” Oprah and Katie Couric gush over parents who “support” their kids down the path of transitioning as though their gender identity is unshakeable forever. As 14-year-old transgender Jazz Jennings told Katie Couric: “I can’t change. I was born that way.”

The clear message is that any child who says he or she is the opposite sex should view it as unchangeable (though the vast majority end up stabilizing into their birth sex.) The message to any skeptical parents is that they are hateful and unfit.

How can these kids, some as young as three and four, realize the implications of following through? They don’t have a clue that doing so can mean taking hormone blockers to prevent puberty that disrupts their development. Then, post-puberty, they would take cross-hormones of the opposite sex. This basically sterilizes them. If there’s irreversible surgery on top of it all, what happens if they regret it? Regret is not at all rare. Walt Heyer, who blogs at sexchangeregret.com, can attest to this. He’s been a source of support to many regretters like himself. But Leelah’s Law is not set up to acknowledge anybody who regrets transitioning or to help them de-transition.

Leelah’s Law Is Bad Medicine

Heyer’s blog cites a national survey of more than 6,500 transgenders that asked the question, “Have you tried to commit suicide?” Forty-one percent answered, “Yes.” That’s astonishingly more than the national average of less than 2 percent. Virtually all people who attempt suicide are suffering from some form of mental disorder or depression. So it should seem clear that blaming society for that depression will not address the dysphoria and depression an individual feels. Neither is the assumption that transitioning and psychosurgery is the only line of defense for gender dysphoria.

It should seem clear that blaming society for that depression will not address the dysphoria and depression an individual feels.

Gender dysphoria is a term used to describe the state of those who have a deep sense of uneasiness because they feel their sex is different from the sex of their body and their DNA. It’s a relatively new term. The fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) listed the condition as Gender Identity Disorder (GID), but due to political lobbying, the American Psychiatric Association re-classified it in the fifth edition with the softer label. Nevertheless, according to DSM-V, dysphoria means that such patients have “clinically significant distress” associated with their feeling of being the opposite sex.

Dysphoria itself is generally defined as “a state of feeling unwell or unhappy.” Depression, likewise, is generally “a state of feeling sad” or, more clinically significant: “a serious medical condition in which a person feels very sad, hopeless, and unimportant and often is unable to live in a normal way.”

Clearly, Leelah Josh Alcorn was feeling dysphoric. And he likely suffered from depression, as do virtually all suicide victims. But where did that inner dysphoria and depression come from? Leelah’s Law would make it legally risky for therapists to ask that question in any meaningful way, or in any way that allows transgenders to journey into their past experiences to discover and understand that there may have been triggers for their dysphoria. Even if the patient sincerely wanted to do that, the chilling effect of Leelah’s Law would deter many counselors from even engaging them.

So here’s a summary of potential side effects from Leelah’s Law:

It sets up a medical protocol that assumes one treatment option for gender dysphoric children: shedding the identity of their physical sex.

It doesn’t allow for therapy in cases of regret.

It assumes that society’s at fault for gender dysphoria, so it doesn’t account for co-existing mental disorders that could be causing the dysphoria, and treating those before transitioning.

transitioning. It prevents doctors from exploring with a patient any environmental factors that could have led to gender dysphoria, forcing the assumption that gender identity is innate and unchangeable.

This means that more cases of depression are bound to go untreated whenever dysphoria co-exists with depression or other mental disorders

It provides an extra layer of protection for pedophiles since it short-circuits so much parent-to-child communication

Big Trans Aids Big Gov

The transgender lobby is no ordinary lobby. It’s been the under-the-radar “T” in LGBT for many years. With same-sex marriage seemingly in the rearview mirror, it now flies in the radar fan with a vengeance.

Leelah’s Law essentially invites Big Brother into your family, therapy sessions and even your church.

This brand of transgender activism is international in its vision, and President Obama’s White House has its back. Consider that Obamacare just opened the door to allow Medicare coverage of sex reassignment surgery for seniors. Just before Christmas, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced that Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act on sex discrimination covers gender identity as well. The media juggernaut will continue to be ramped up also.

Leelah’s Law essentially invites Big Brother into your family, therapy sessions and even your church. As such, it’s a formula for more state meddling in personal relationships and looks to be an effective tool for consolidating state power.

Youth suicides, like all suicides, are horrific tragedies with so many layers of guilt, blame, angst, and suffering. It’s impossible to wrap one’s head around the compounded evil of such mysteries. But this suicide is being super-hyped—to the exclusion of any other “type” of teen suicide—to promote the criminalization of any counseling or psychotherapy for children that does not promote transgenderism. By logical extension, this would apply to any parent who does not promote transgenderism in their child.

"From Fake Rapes To ‘Microaggressions,’ Colleges Have Lost Their Way","For anyone still keeping up with the University of Virginia’s fraternity gang-rape fiasco, this month brought a bit of good news: the Charlottesville Police Department announced it could find no proof that the alleged gang rape had occurred at Phi Kappa Psi. UVA subsequently reinstated the fraternity after having shut it down a few months before.

This is small comfort to a debacle that has been both shameful and injudicious from start to finish. If there is anything good to be had from the entire mess, it is that a slapdash and irresponsible publication has been justly humiliated, and that an incompetent and malicious journalist has been perhaps permanently outcast from the good graces of the Fourth Estate. So far as I can tell, Sabrina Rubin Erdely has not been heard from publicly since last tweeting at the end of November. That is fine by me; indeed, if she finishes out her career as an obscure copy editor at a small-town bi-weekly, I do not think journalism as a whole will be worse off, even if the small-town bi-weekly suffers.

Yet the Rolling Stone fiasco is on the main depressing and discouraging, if for no other reason than it has starkly highlighted the fundamental hollowness of our institutions of higher learning, saturated as they have become by the often-toxic influence of academic leftism.

A Microcosm of U.S. Colleges’ Sick Culture

Indeed, UVA provided a perfect example of the moral bankruptcy one often finds at the average American college. In the wake of the Rolling Stone article, the university suspended Greek life on campus with no due process whatsoever; a University of Virginia law school student demanded that Phi Kappa Psi be treated as a “criminal street gang” subject to asset seizure by the government; the fraternity house was vandalized; and effectively the entire university lined up against a group of young men who had been viciously slandered in a national media outlet based on the strength of one uncorroborated and unexamined accusation. “The whole [fraternity] culture,” claimed UVA English professor Alison Booth, with no irony whatsoever, “is sick.”

From its administration to its faculty to its studentry, the University of Virginia displayed the aplomb of a sulky teenager unwilling to think critically about even the most basic of ethical considerations.

The University of Virginia, in other words, behaved shamefully and with no civic decorum: from its administration to its faculty to its studentry, the entire institution displayed the aplomb of a sulky teenager unwilling to think critically about even the most basic of ethical considerations. UVA’s president, Teresa Sullivan, should be apologizing profusely to the members of Phi Kappa Psi along with the whole fraternity community. Instead, she’s forcing fraternities to adopt pointless new rules on the basis of a single allegation that even the police now dispute.

Would that this kind of illiberal folly were limited simply to the University of Virginia: Thomas Jefferson would roll over in his grave, and that would be the end of it. But our country’s universities and colleges are steeped in this stuff. From coast to coast, the vanities of progressivism are having a profoundly negative effect on our institutions of higher learning.

Feminism Steps Up to Fill the Place of Eugenics

Unsurprisingly, much of this bankrupt ideology centers on feminism, which has filled the role that eugenics once filled in American universities: a crystalline instance of peak Progressive thought animated by bigotry and pseudoscience. Modern feminism drove much of the witch hunt on UVA’s campus, for instance, and it can be seen at plenty of other colleges, as well. Sarah Edwards, an assistant professor at the University of North Dakota, recently published a study that purported to show that one in three college men would rape a woman if the word “rape” wasn’t used and if they were told they could get away with it. The study itself cited flawed and disproven data in its opening paragraph, bad enough, but it also surveyed only 86 men at UND, a tiny sample whose results are assuredly not indicative of 30 percent of all men everywhere, or probably even 30 percent of men on UND’s campus. Nine of the young men claimed that, even with the word “rape” thrown in, they would still rape a woman; this may seem shocking until you consider the likely reality that, as Ashe Scow put it wryly, “nine college boys didn’t take the survey too seriously.”

A kind of frantic Progressive paranoia runs through much of academia, a certainty that the world is a brutal and inhumane place—for everyone, that is, except white men.

Pointing out the deficiencies of a highly suspect study, however, is not enough to repair the intellectual rot that permeates so much of our campuses these days. A kind of frantic Progressive paranoia runs through much of academia, a certainty that the world is a brutal and inhumane place—for everyone, that is, except white men. Earlier this month, Harvard’s “Voices of Diversity Project” published a study that claims to express the difficulties women and minorities face on college campuses across the country. A number of these experiences were stark examples of prejudice, yet many if not most of the researchers’ interpretations of these events are highly subjective, prominent among them “microaggressions.” These undetectable phantom slights, according to the researchers, force these students to “spend a great deal of time in internal dialogue” and “feeling apprehension and anguish” about bringing up the perceived microaggressions out of fear that “they will only be told that they are overly sensitive or even that they are imagining it.”

Leave aside for a moment the likely possibility that most microaggressions are imagined, and instead focus on the absurd suggestion that any American university is actually hostile in any way towards women or minorities. The only college explicitly named in the study—Missouri State University—has a politically correct diversity apparatus that takes every opportunity to heighten the standing and prestige of non-white, non-male university students: a Division for Diversity and Inclusion, a “theatre organization” called “Giving Voice” that aims to “represent the challenges of underrepresented, marginalized, and oppressed persons;” an outreach series called “Shattering the Silence” that has thus far addressed “microaggressions,” “diversity” and “cultural stereotypes;” and “Heritage Months,” special month-long celebrations that “[honor] the heritage and history of different groups” (during last October’s LGBT History Month, you could attend a seminar on “Homophobic Dilemmas of Pop Culture,” drop by an “LGBT Alliance/Spectrum Mixer,” and, to finish out the month, participate in the “Big Gay Talent Show”). There’s also an Office of Multicultural Services, an LGBT Resource Center, and—later this year—the Statewide Collaborative Diversity Conference.

To justify the increasingly useless liberal arts degrees that modern universities churn out, the leaders of these universities must fabricate a vicious and threatening world against which the university itself is arrayed.

No sane person could look at this panoply of ultra-left-leaning, hyper-tolerant offerings to Missouri State students and conclude that the university is hostile towards any group of people. When you also consider that the majority of modern American college students are among the most open-minded and culturally-sensitive human beings to have ever existed—young men and women that will go out of their way to avoid “microaggressions” and positively prostrate themselves to atone for them—then the Harvard study appears even more nonsensical and bizarre, and its unstated agenda becomes even starker: the point is not to shed light on a hostile campus climate, but to convince everyone that the hostile climate exists in the first place. Like the wreckers and the kulaks of the Soviet Union, “microaggressions” have become the scapegoat for a deeply flawed and wholly subpar way of doing things. To justify the increasingly useless liberal arts degrees that modern universities churn out, the leaders of these universities must fabricate a vicious and threatening world against which the university itself is arrayed: the point of higher education in these circles is less about education and more about Big Gay Talent Shows and a war against invisible insults.

Do Students Even Want to Think?

In defense of the college administrator, there is ample evidence that the modern university student is not capable, or even desirous, of what Steinbeck called “the freedom of the mind to take any direction it wishes, undirected.” The average college student appears to be genuinely fearful of the world and eager to exert a suffocating kind of control over it. At the University of Chicago last week, the Maroon student newspaper ran an editorial with the headline “Land of the Free?” The implicit subhead might have read: “We can fix that.” The Maroon’s editorial board, you see, does not like free speech: it wishes the University of Chicago would regulate speech that “offends” and “insults” people.

The average college student appears to be genuinely fearful of the world and eager to exert a suffocating kind of control over it.

“Vile” and “cruel” speech, according to the frightened crack team at the helm of the Maroon, should be suppressed for the sake of “students’ mental well-being or safety.” Since the editorial board of the Maroon is a direct threat to both of those things, it’s a wonder the editors don’t self-censor and shut down the newspaper altogether. Jokes aside, it is worth reflecting on and savoring the naked insanity of this call for suppression. The privileged, moneyed elect of one of the most elite universities in the country is admittedly, openly afraid of insults and offense, so much so that they wish for the powers that be to regulate them out of existence. The men and women of the Maroon are simply cowards, first for desiring open censorship of words they dislike and second for being too timorous to admit their cowardice outright. As the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education points out, the Maroon board is not alone: speech is heavily regulated at most U.S. colleges.

These are our universities and colleges; this is what they do. With a professorship drifting ever-leftward, we should not be surprised. From the feminist witch-hunts at UVA to the frank misandry of UND, from the microaggression scares taking place with no sense of awareness alongside a liberal diversity mega-complex, to an unequivocal call for censorship at one of the top institutions in the nation—these are clear snapshots of the state of American higher education in the twenty-first century.

Education is meant for what the Vatican once termed ‘the formation of the human person in the pursuit of his ultimate end.’

To turn these and many other colleges around will require a conscious effort on the part of faculty and students, taxpayers and donors, administrations and boards. Education is meant for what the Vatican once termed “the formation of the human person in the pursuit of his ultimate end.” The fear, the sociological gibberish and the amateur despotism of many of our institutions of higher learning are working towards no such noble goal, and indeed seem to be working in direct contravention of it. It will not be easy to reverse this trend—but if we don’t, we’ll be left with college campuses that foster and encourage lynch mobs and thought police in place of actual education. Why would we want to send our young men and women to such dreadful and hateful places?

The United States’ Unwritten Blasphemy Laws,"Never has the costless but self-affirming political gesture been easier or more prevalent than now, when a hashtag or an avatar passes for principled stand. But the principles on which free societies are based cannot, in the long run, be defended without taking on risk.

There is, to be sure, something charming about spontaneous online movements such as “Je suis Charlie.” Although there are legitimate concerns about the particular brand of speech Charlie Hebdo specializes in, on the whole public support for the magazine and its staff has been salutary—and better than the victim-blaming alternative. It is exactly this type of popular display that nurtures a culture of free expression.

Here I want to draw a distinction between a culture of free expression and simple free speech. The latter is a legal question that depends exclusively on having and enforcing a robust free-speech legal regime. This concept is not directly at issue in the Charlie Hebdo incident, nor in this essay. Although we can quibble, the United States and, to a lesser extent, Western Europe have strong free-speech legal regimes.

Our Anemic Culture of Free Expression

A culture of free expression depends on a proper legal regime, but it also requires a people who value and actively support diverse and challenging expression, both in form and in content. A society where many fear exercising their legal rights due to the threat of social reprisal may have free speech, but not a culture of free expression. Sometimes, especially where constitutional schemes are different or weaker than in the United States, an anemic culture of free expression can corrode legal free speech.

A society where many fear exercising their legal rights due to the threat of social reprisal may have free speech, but not a culture of free expression.

Any enthusiasm we might have about America’s culture of free expression in the wake of Charlie Hebdo should be tempered by the relative silence of the free-speech brigade about controversies where speaking out carries real risk. Tweeting a hashtag in support of murdered cartoonists is costless. Almost everyone agrees the killing was wrong, and there’s no way the Islamists are going to track down Mr. #JeSuisCharlie from Paducah, Kentucky. You can cancel your ADT Security subscription.

But what about when standing up for a culture of free expression carries the risk of a loss of social or professional standing? What about when the fire chief of Atlanta, Georgia, was fired for expressing boilerplate Christian disapproval of homosexual acts in a book he published? What about when Brendan Eich was forced out at Mozilla for donating to Proposition 8? What about when Bret Baier and Gary Sinise were harangued for agreeing to appear at a run-of-the-mill Catholic gala until they canceled?

Sure, there has been support for Chief Kelvin Cochran, but in almost all cases from predictable sources—those who agree with the opinions that got him fired. It was largely the same for Eich (with a few notable exceptions), and for the Catholic group, Legatus. But if only people who agreed with the content of Charlie Hebdo’s satire showed up online or in the streets of Paris, it would’ve been a lonely adventure. A culture of free expression requires that people who disagree with controversial speech be willing to pin their personal brand to their opponents’. That is something very few will do if there’s a risk that it will tarnish their brand.

‘Homophobia’ Is the American Blasphemy

Let’s be clear here: I’m not saying that LGBT activism is worse that Islamic terrorism. I am saying that to support a robust right to speech perceived to be offensive to LGBT people carries greater risk for the average American than to support a robust right to speech perceived to be offensive to Muslims—or really any religious group.

When a people is as risk-averse in political posturing as we are, the movement most willing to exact a personal price for opposition will win.

When a people is as risk-averse in political posturing as we are, the movement most willing to exact a personal price for opposition will win. This explains the American elite’s newfound passion for LGBT rights. The movement carefully worked to make it socially embarrassing to hold traditional views of sexual morality. For example, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) has created an Index Librorum Prohibitorum, but for public commentators. The point is to shame and marginalize their opponents. It’s smart, cynical, and effective.

If there’s one thing an elite hates, it’s embarrassment. (The second thing an elite hates is risk.) With the support of this elite, “homophobia” is becoming just as much a blasphemy as real blasphemy has ever been in this country.

Now, every society has its blasphemies—speech that, even if legal, is not tolerated socially. A man can use racial slurs in banter with co-workers and not get thrown in jail, but he shouldn’t expect to have many friends (or a job) for long. The growing social intolerance of LGBT slurs is also salutary. A healthy culture of free expression will have a limited number of blasphemies that function to maintain access to that culture for all.

A Cowardly Culture Sets Speech Bandits Free

The question is what those blasphemies will be—and who gets to decide. This requires a free people to be vigilant, intelligent, and courageous, because it is always in the interest of the powerful (and especially the ascendant) to smuggle new blasphemies into our culture. This brings us back to the rise of the costless gesture.

An unwillingness to take on risk to defend free speech delivers our culture into the hands of the powerful and the unscrupulous. If we all sit back and let Cochran and Eich be punished professionally and socially for publicly opposing the tenets of an ascendant movement, we will have permitted that movement to codify a new blasphemy not through persuasion, but through extortion. We will have indicated that, once a group is powerful and clever enough to be able to make opposition risky, we will not resist even corrosion of the culture of free expression. This is not how a free people remains free.

I’m not a huge fan of the language Cochran used in his book to describe homosexuality. As I’ve argued elsewhere, Christians in particular should approach this issue with grace, charity, and understanding even beyond what we think is necessary. In the face of a movement that wants to mark orthodox Christian teachings blasphemous, we must not speak carelessly lest we confirm the stereotype that is calcifying around us.

At the same time, Cochran’s is exactly the type of marginal speech, like much of Charlie Hebdo’s, that needs to be defended to prevent those margins from tightening. This narrowing is exactly what will happen unless we are willing to take a little risk—potentially tarnishing our personal brand by associating with embarrassing people—in defense of a strong culture of free expression.

LBGT Demands For Other People’s Children Are Misogynistic,"The U.S. Supreme Court has recently announced it will review a November decision by the Sixth Circuit Court—which represents Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee—that upheld marriage as between a man and a woman. Will the Supreme Court side with the two judges in the majority, or with the one dissenting judge?

The majority ruling dismisses any possibility of a constitutional right to gay marriage, while the dissent focuses on an entirely different question of whether gay parents are as good as straight ones. The latter controversy is something that the majority decision explicitly refused to weigh in on, so the dissent is a curious non sequitur.

Since I was raised in the LBGT household and am the daughter of a lesbian, I am anxious to see if children’s rights are something that the Supreme Court considers. The dissent from Martha Craig Daughtrey does not consider the rights of children. Rather, she treats children as a social nuisance and or as an entitlement owed to same-sex couples.

LGBT ‘Rights’ Trample Women and Children’s Rights

The “marriage equality” arguments leverage children, often claiming that if gay adults can marry the children they are raising will benefit from broader “protections.” This is doublespeak. The “protections” consist of the gay adults’ access to and control of children as commodities. Activists have enough savvy to realize it is better that people did not see this hidden inconsistency. Most people are still fixated on the initial claims: “between two consenting adults who are not hurting anyone else.”

LGBT-demanded legal ‘protections’ consist of the gay adults’ access to and control of children as commodities.

Not a single same-sex couple can reproduce together. It behooves us to analyze the ways that same-sex marriage demands other people’s children as a “civil right” and in so doing invariably denies both women their own children and children their right to a mother and a father.

The dissent rests primarily on the personal vignettes of the cherry-picked litigants, who are rather predictable, gold-star lesbian moms. Women play better than men in these cases. The plaintiffs in DeBoer v. Snyder are a lesbian couple with three adopted children. The argument taps into old prejudices against children born out of wedlock and downgrades supposedly irresponsible women. Judge Daughtrey’s dissent pays special attention to the biographical specifics of these children:

N was born . . . to a biological mother who was homeless, had psychological impairments, was unable to care for N, and subsequently surrendered her legal rights to N. The plaintiffs volunteered to care for the boy, brought him into their home following his birth…

Daughtrey is sure to note of the biological mother, “She surrendered her legal rights.” How did the birth mother do this if she was “impaired”? The unstable and impoverished mother is a useful trope in misogynistic and classist discourse. I wonder what was done to find this biological mother housing so she could in fact leave the hospital with her son. It is likely that few if any good-faith attempts were made to keep “N” with his mother, let alone find his father and enforce child support or at least compel some kind of connection so “N” could know his origins.

Using the State to Tear Families Apart

Rather than a story of an abusive system ripping a child away from where he came from, it is presented as a tale of sacrifice and heroism on the part of the women who adopted the infants. Equally disturbing is the fact that this is expressed with no regard to the child’s future feelings, only as it serves to make the couple appear worthy and deserving.

Gay families are compromised by their need to tear apart other people’s families using the oppressive force of the state and its legal apparatuses.

This begs the question as whether or not this “biological mother” had the mental capacity to surrender her rights. Could the adoptive “mothers” have had legal counsel, while the birth mother was without any support navigating the often-hostile legal maze? When these stories go public, these details are hidden, seemingly by design, and asking such questions is treated as taboo. Perhaps upon further scrutiny, readers will discover that gay families are compromised by their need to tear apart other people’s families using the oppressive force of the state and its legal apparatuses.

In so many ways the dissenting opinion stands as the perfect postmodern artifact, the chalice of the cultural warriors who traffic in distortions. It uses privilege and entitlement while claiming to correct inequality. The end result is that the misogyny of the LGBT movement flings women backward to a dark era, when the rule was prejudice against single mothers and unintended pregnancy.

The dissent’s next example is worse: “J was born . . . premature . . . to a drug addicted prostitute” (p. 46). Here we have the other “bad mother” trope—“the junky whore.” Many mothers would have demanded that all discussion of the children be removed from the public eye because it can and will be hurtful to them. I wonder if either these women did that, or knew they could.

Benefitting from Other People’s Misfortunes

People use their children in all kinds of ways. Except these are often other people’s children and they did not have to be conscripted to a life of distortion and play-acting. These children are never the result of same-sex couples’ accidental pregnancy. In this case, nobody forced them to “adopt” children, so it seems a tad manipulative to use these children to back an argument for marriage. Juxtaposed alongside the description of bad mothers stands the worthiness of the plaintiffs.

Nobody forced any gay couple to ‘adopt’ children, so it seems a tad manipulative to use these children to back an argument for marriage.

I should know better and expect less. Nevertheless, it is still deeply disappointing to read through the dissent. The good judge tries to suggest that families are not destabilized but built by presenting the birthmothers as horrific—one mentally ill, the other a drug-addicted prostitute. So much for compassion and the milk of human kindness flowing from the bench. We hear it loud and clear: these mothers did not deserve their own children. The bulk of the screed—and there is some real spleen-venting taking place—is an emotional appeal rather than an ethically principled position that even considers all parties as equal. Drug-addicted and mentally ill prostitutes are not “equal.” Junkie prostitutes give birth and the on-duty nurse gets to take the baby home—no muss, no fuss. A win- win situation. Does hospital staff get first dibs? I really don’t know.

I suspect that a culture that needs to traffic in distortions is inherently abusive. The gay marriage narrative needs to be defended at all costs and requires enforced compliance from others. This can be seen in the parenting as well as the political strategies. The only difference is the scale and the target of the coercion. On a broad political level, consider the Log Cabin Republicans and the fact that this movement only stands to benefit from society withholding services and support that would enable vulnerable poor women to keep their children (when they are actually the mother). This becomes predatory in practice and anti-equality in intent.

Commercializing and Colonizing the Uterus

The LGBT movement comes across as downright reasonable when they demand, and rightly so, that the state stay out of their bedrooms. Maybe people need to demand that they stay out of women’s wombs and stop trying to enforce their parental will on children. They ought to respect the fact that all children have the right to a mother and a father.

All gay families are created by or because of someone else’s family being destabilized.

The truth is that most people, including those on the bench, have not fully considered how these new gay families are going to be formed. They did not attend one of the slick “surrogacy expos” like the tenth annual one that took place in New York last November. The title is telling: “Men Having Babies.” Not “gay people getting married” or “children dealing with blended families,” or anything like that. Men are possessors and babies are their property. “What do we want—wombs. When do we want ‘em? Now.”

Why shouldn’t they be able to use the eggs from the college coed and the womb of the woman who has proven herself as breeder material—in other words, a poor heterosexual woman? A detour for social justice has brought us to the commercial for-profit uterus.

All of this will destabilize the family by turning women into breeding stock and infants into commodities. How dare we question the billion-dollar industry? We are not supposed to think about the long-term effects of untested hyper-ovulation drugs or the women that have died as a result. We are not supposed to think of the effect that mommy giving away the baby in her tummy has on the other children in that family, especially the female children (you too, little Janie, can grow up and be a breeder) We are not supposed to think about her marriage, because she needs the money. So let’s not think.

All gay families are created by or because of someone else’s family being destabilized. This can only work in a callous society hobbled by indifference to women and poverty. This is a social regression dressed up as progress.

Does the Existence of Evil Give License to Expand It?

In the battle over gay marriage, people are bombarded by rhetorical scams that would not pass muster in Comp 101. Somehow they go unquestioned. They often use the myth of the high divorce rate and the vast number of children being raised by single parents (mostly mothers) as a talking point to say that gay marriage cannot do the serious harm that irresponsible straight people have. Let’s examine this. Some children lose a parent through death, divorce, or social dysfunction. This does not mean that as a society we have the right to legislate away children’s right to a mother and a father. We don’t.

Social policy is not meant to redress the fact that women can have babies and men can’t or that women and men can reproduce and same sex couples can’t.

Gay marriage advocates deploy distorted generalizations based on women’s rights to have a child with or without a man. This magically translates into a demand that society provide gay men with other people’s kids. Let’s examine this. Social policy is not meant to redress the fact that women can have babies and men can’t or that women and men can reproduce and same sex couples can’t.

As a children’s rights activist, feminist, and adult child of a lesbian mother, I have pointed out these predatory practices. I have been called a bigot. My family has come under abusive harassment from gay men calling themselves activists. But despite all the energy devoted to claiming I am liar or ugly or crazy they have never once addressed a single point I have made.

Recall, not so long ago we had young unwed mothers locked away, shamed, and coerced into giving up babies they surely could not to raise themselves. The updated version is: women “like that” do not “deserve” to be mothers. Does the misogynistic gay lobby get to role-play big brother and say what women deserve?

This Isn’t Love—It’s Human Trafficking

Recently gay activist Dan Savage called publically for the criminal prosecution of the parents of a teenager who had just committed suicide (Joshua/Leelah Alcorn). Let’s examine this too. He has demanded that LGBT activists serve as state-sanctioned overlords who will enforce their control and worldview on heterosexual parents and their children. This is the next wave: Co-parenting with GLAAD and the Human Rights Campaign. Maybe Terry Bean will babysit after he resolves his legal issues.

Who could have ever envisioned that the Fourteenth Amendment would become a tool to strip poor and minority women and their children of human rights?

In her final sentence, Daughtrey says, “If we in judiciary do not have the authority, indeed the responsibility to right fundamental wrongs left excused by a majority of the electorate, our whole intricate, constitutional system of checks and balances, as well as the oaths we swore, prove to be nothing but shams.”

Who could have ever envisioned that the Fourteenth Amendment would become a tool to strip poor and minority women and their children of human rights? A decision from the bench that ignores the questions surrounding children’s rights betrays society’s animus toward women and the poor. Who exactly is being denied “due process” and “equal protection”?

The new social justice dictum is that society owes LBGT people the flesh and blood of other people’s children because they are “married” now. Let’s be honest. Love does not make a family in this case. Human trafficking does.

A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Vomitorium,"So are you ready to set aside “Fifty Shades of Grey” and talk about the normalization of sexual relations between humans and animals? Seriously, in November New York Magazine ran an exhaustive interview with a 42-year-old man from Canada who described in graphic detail his love affairs with horses. (Oh, by the way, he says he’s “lucky” to have his human wife because that way “nobody would ever guess.”) He argues that bestiality—or, in politically correct parlance, “zoophilia”—should be legal and socially de-stigmatized. Meanwhile, in Germany, Oliver Burdinski has been out and proud with his lover, a Siberian husky named Joey, but he’s faced the possibility of being separated from Joey since Germany outlawed bestiality last year.

“Oh, the humanity!” But never fear, because the activists of the bestiality rights group ZETA—Zoophile Engagement for Tolerance and Enlightenment—is on the case.

“Zoos,” as they call themselves, feel misunderstood, and they’re starting to come out of the closet. In fact, it’s the last of a long line up of sexual taboos that are being challenged today. Which brings us to the question: What is the difference between “slippery slope” and “liberation gateway drug?” Not much, if you’re following sexual trends these days.

Daily Beast author Jay Michaelson recently vindicated the old slippery slope argument by stating: “I do like the idea of same sex marriage as a liberation gateway drug.” His prediction was that same-sex marriage is likely to result in the “Christian right’s nightmare,” in which society sees the spreading of new “sexual possibilities” and practices. Gay marriage will very likely transform marriage, Michaelson asserts, and non-monogamy could very well be one of the things gays “teach” straights. In other words, a funny thing has happened on the way to complete legalization: advocates are now saying (taunting?) that gay marriage may have exactly the effect the opposition has warned against. Perhaps it’ll be, as the Daily Beast’s teaser affectionately put it, “a Bible thumper’s idea of Sodom and Gommorah.”

Okay, so why not give that last premise some real consideration? Michaelson’s piece, basically on cause and effect, is an open invitation to speculate not just on the future of monogamy, but on the future of all “sexual possibility,” just as the Christian Right warned. Here’s a tweet (image warning) reaction to his piece that celebrates the Pandora’s Box theory.

Let’s Play Some More ‘What If?’

What if all of our sexual taboos were legalized in the interests of tolerance and freedom? Or what if normalization of all taboos was simply allowed to “evolve” in the wake of ever-more calls for ever more tolerance?

According to these yarns, the gluttonous Romans would take time outs in a room where they’d upchuck their barely-digested delicacies.

As we careen down this already well-greased slope, you may recall tales about the excesses in the fall of Rome. You may have also heard accounts of the “vomitorium,” at which partakers could never get enough of the banquet. According to these yarns, the gluttonous Romans would take time outs in a room where they’d upchuck their barely-digested delicacies. Then they’d go back to gorge some more. In like manner, the modest among us can barely imagine how sexual gluttons—like Roman bacchanals—might hasten also to a place in which they cast off one sexual novelty or scenario to try on another. And another and another in rapid succession.

The vomitorium stories, even if apocryphal, tell us something of human nature and uncontrolled appetites. Lack of self-regulation can lead to addictive behaviors and the elusive quest for ever-higher highs. In the end, it doesn’t matter how few or how many join in. It doesn’t even matter if a newly legalized behavior is limited to a small sub-culture in society. Once legalized, any and all contents poured into the trough of sexual practices will affect and, sooner or later, transform the mores of the whole society.

Such is the life of porn and drug habits alike. Brain circuitry rewires, and certain obsessive appetites go into hyperdrive. As more sexual taboos are openly challenged, our society offers more all-you-can-eat sexual buffets. For some, this gives the illusion of a state of ecstasy between visits to the vomitorium. For others, it induces a dizzying state of nausea.

But whether you’re puking (voluntarily or otherwise)—or maybe you haven’t even noticed what’s on the smorgasbord just yet?—we should all understand up front where the collapse of more taboos would likely take us.

The Sexual ‘Liberation Gateway Drug’

For starters, same-sex marriage seems to be mutating into hostility towards the very idea of monogamous marriage. Chances are Michaelson would never have called same-sex marriage a “liberation gateway drug” if the agenda didn’t yet seem pretty much a done deal. The title of his article—“Were Christians Right about Gay Marriage all Along?”—should deeply chagrin those who lent their support only because they were convinced it was all about state-sanctioned, monogamous marriage for gays.

Michaelson’s central question is: “What if gay marriage really will change the institution of marriage, shifting conceptions around monogamy and intimacy?” And there you have it: the bait and the switch of same-sex marriage.

First, the Bait

The illusion of support for same-sex marriage—extracted through emotional blackmail and the social extortion we know as political correctness—was based on the idea of “marriage equality.” It was deceptively packaged and still clings to the civil-rights movement like a parasite on its host.

You know the story. It continues to play out as owners of small wedding businesses are hectored, sued, and forced to close shop when religious conscience on the definition of marriage forbids their compliance. It continues to play out as folks like former Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich are forced to step down when their view is discovered and publicly exposed as a thought crime. It continues to play out with political rewards for those who switch sides and severe punishments for those who can’t or won’t.

Coming Up: the Switch

I believe the ultimate switch will be the complete abolition of state recognition of all marriage and family relationships, which I wrote about in April. Throughout the PR campaign for same-sex marriage, the public was baited with the presumption that genderless marriage was merely meant to expand marriage as a monogamous institution. This presumption was carefully coddled by the LGBT lobby in its media hype.

Not so much anymore. Michaelson confesses: “there is some truth to the conservative claim that gay marriage is changing, not just expanding, marriage. According to a 2013 study, about half of gay marriages surveyed were not strictly monogamous. This fact is well-known in the gay community—indeed, we assume it’s more like three-quarters.” [emphasis added]

Anyhow, Michaelson seems delight in taking off his mask—or the mask of the LGBT lobby—on this point:

But it’s been fascinating to see how my straight friends react to it. Some feel they’ve been duped: They were fighting for marriage equality, not marriage redefinition. . . . But radical traditionalists aren’t the only ones fearing the consequences of same-sex marriage. So, it may surprise you to learn, are radical progressives. ‘Marriage will never set us free,’ wrote academics Dean Spade and Craig Wilse last September, just as the current wave was getting going . . . Why? Because marriage is a patriarchal, sexist institution that should be discarded rather than reformed.

Indeed, the switch will come when your marriage—“radical traditionalist” or otherwise—is abolished and the state completely isolates you, no longer recognizing family autonomy.

Michaelson’s rejection of monogamy was echoed in a recent Buzzfeed piece about gay sex in which activist David Tuller stated: “I’ve heard straight people say that they’ve come to support same-sex marriage because they know loving, monogamous gay couples . . . I think that’s a widespread assumption among heterosexual people — that men in same-sex marriages will adopt monogamy as a lifestyle value. And I think that’s probably a very questionable assumption.”

So the transition between the bait and the switch on marriage definitely looks like it’ll be an era of sexual license that challenges monogamy. Of course, the signatories of the 2006 Manifesto “Beyond Same Sex Marriage”—many of them prominent academics and celebrities—already confessed to this years ago.

So Here We Are . . . and Awaaay We Go!

The end of monogamy is only the first course in the sexual buffet post-genderless marriage. As Michaelson concedes, the opponents of same-sex marriage who warned that it would open a Pandora’s Box normalizing non-monogamy were likely right after all. So were they just as correct about other sexual taboos that might further break down family and society cohesion if society expands notions of sexual intimacy in the wake of “marriage equality?”

Even though homosexuality is now more widely accepted than could possibly have been imagined just 15 years ago, most Americans still cringe at and stigmatize other sexual practices

Even though homosexuality is now more widely accepted than could possibly have been imagined just 15 years ago, most Americans still cringe at and stigmatize other sexual practices, including polyamory, incest, group sex, pedophilia, sado-masochism, and the delicate matter of oh-c’mon-that-could-never-happen bestiality—to name just a few leftover taboos. But how long can such stigmas hold up in an era of PC fascism that thrives on making the implausible seem plausible to the public?

So what could be next, beyond same-sex marriage? Michaelson focuses pretty much on the end of monogamy in his piece. But he concedes it’s all a big question mark where this all will take us, sexually speaking:

So, if I had to predict, I’d go with a gradual realization of the conservative nightmare—only it won’t be a nightmare, and plenty of straight people will thank us for it. . . . same-sex marriage was really a campaign, not a movement. For a moment, it brought together liberals, progressives, and even some conservatives. But now that its goal is within sight, the center cannot hold. And then, things get interesting.

Exactly how interesting? Let us count at least ten ways.

A Taboo on Taboos?

Over just the past couple of years, proponents of heretofore stigmatized sexual activities seem to be pushing ever edgier sexual practices into the mainstream. We should pay attention to all of this for two reasons. First, because the Internet has a long reach, sowing ideas far and wide. Second, because the fringy side of yesterday has a funny way of suddenly showing up as mainstream on a Time Magazine cover near you today.

Consider the following:

It seems mostly about mechanical sex. In the recent Buzzfeed article so cleverly titled “How We F*ck Now,” celebrated gay men gather round to pontificate about the standard of non-monogamy for gays, same-sex marriage, and what the future holds for higher highs, including speculation about how a daily dose of a drug like Truvada which can be used to prevent AIDS sometimes, may “revolutionize” gay sex by making condoms unnecessary.

The clear message of sex education curricula today is that abstinence is a socially unacceptable mode of behavior for youth.

Group Marriage. The push for legalizing polygamy, which the LGBT lobby claimed for years was a red herring, is naturally happening now for real with sympathetic portrayals in mainstream publications like the Atlantic Monthly and Redbook. Polygamy advocates cheered on the sidelines when the Supreme Court overturned the Defense of Marriage Act in June last year.

Group Sex. The growing drumbeat to normalize group sex, dubbed—for the time being—as one form of “polyamory” is getting lots of mainstream attention. Its practitioners will tell you it’s all about “open relationships” and “big love.”

Sexualization of Children. Kids are sexually active at ever-younger ages, spurred on by the behavior and messaging of the culture and adults around them. The clear message of sex education curricula today, promoted by SIECUS, is that abstinence is a socially unacceptable mode of behavior for youth.

Transgender Children. This represents a virtual neutering. The transgender movement is pushing itself harder than ever on children, especially with a recent article in Slate claiming that infants should not even be identified at birth as boy or girl. The idea is that parents ought to shut up and keep gender identity ambiguous, having pre-school children like Ryland Whittington (nudged by the trans agenda) transitioned to the opposite sex.

A Planned Parenthood counselor was also recently caught on tape advising a 15-year-old girl on BDSM and how to visit sex shops to buy whips and paraphernalia to use for it.

BDSM. It’s not just intended for consenting “adults” anymore, as “Fifty Shades of Grey” might suggest. Planned Parenthood has lent its imprimatur to promotion of BDSM—or Bondage/Domination/Sado-Masochism—for teenagers, rationalizing that it’s a nice way to relate because it means you have to “trust” the partner. A Planned Parenthood counselor was also recently caught on tape advising a 15-year-old girl on BDSM and going to sex shops to buy whips and paraphernalia to use for it.

Pedophila. Academic articles from gender and queer theory are pushing the envelope and cultivating the ground for social acceptance of pedophilia. The British are debating about classifying it as another “sexual orientation.” Lowering the age of consent is high on the agenda, under cover of “liberating” the sexuality of the child.

Anonymous Sex. Aside from one-night-stands and prostitution and bathhouses, some advocates of sex with strangers are aspiring to higher forms of respectability, even with a religious air. Consider a recent phenomenon in the guise of something dubbed “orgasmic meditation,” or OM (as in the Buddhist mantra). This is a twofer since it’s paid sex, so serves also as a thin veil for prostitution. It started in San Francisco and is now coming to New York via Boulder.

Incest. Some mainstream media reporting on incest cases, particularly the grandmother-grandson romance and pregnancy, can seem sympathetic, and have a desensitizing effect on incest as a taboo. “Incest Is Hot,” according to MTV plans for upcoming shows.

Celebrating Porn. Many colleges have been hosting popular porn-sponsored events called “Sex Week” for a while now. (Apparently they don’t think mechanical and anonymous sex is happening enough in those places.) Torture Porn gets positive coverage in a Salon article written by a fan of it. It seems to be growing in popularity. Federalist author Brandon McGinley speculates “We May Be Approaching Peak Porn.”

Normalization of bestiality apparently begins—as with every sex act ever rationalized—with the tiresome explanation that it has always existed and has actually been considered ‘common’ and ‘healthy’ in other eras and places.

“Twincest” has become popular pornography among gay men. This American Thinker article explains what’s going on with mainstream gay magazines celebrating and interviewing sets of identical twins from the Czech Republic and Brazil who sodomize for the camera. The fad is being cultivated with articles that serve to desensitize and explain to readers why they’ve “gotten over twincest and started thinking it’s hot.”

Inter-Species Sex. The 2005 book by Andrea Beetz, “Bestiality and Zoophilia: Sexual Relations with Animals,” describes a “very delicate subject, one of the last taboos,” and suggests it is a sexual orientation. Normalization of bestiality apparently begins—as with every sex act ever rationalized—with the tiresome explanation that it has always existed and has actually been considered “common” and “healthy” in other eras and places.

Animal Brothels. There have been reports of animal brothels doing brisk business in countries such as Germany (which just recently outlawed bestiality) and Denmark, where they are considered legal and the activity itself is merely a “lifestyle choice.”

The above is a short list. But step back and you can see a picture emerging that’s not of a community of individuals living in harmony and freedom, but more of an addicted collective, slurping at a trough of displaced cravings. It seems as though our souls have become so separated from our bodies and our minds so unfastened from reality—and separated from one another—that we look like The Lonely Crowd on steroids.

Funny Things Happen on the Way

These trends, if allowed to continue, can’t help but erode the private sphere into nothingness. If we don’t regulate ourselves—and our laws don’t support self-regulation—a funny thing is likely to happen on the way to the vomitorium: the “Pink Police State” will step in and regulate us for ourselves. And in the end, it doesn’t really matter if only a few people in a subculture practice these things. With the legalization and de-stigmatization of things like polygamy or incest or other sexual taboos, the outcome is always hard cases that create excuses for making ever more bad laws to rule over us.

In truly free societies, taboos help people self-regulate, and keep their behaviors in check.

For power elites so inclined, promoting the illusion of freedom helps to mobilize and control the masses. In this scenario, sober habits like abstinence and thrift have a way of becoming the new and subversive taboos, frowned upon by the elites.

In truly free societies, taboos help people self-regulate, and keep their behaviors in check. Reasonable taboos that encourage self-control and respect for human dignity actually balance our freedom and thus help to secure it. They have an anchoring effect that stabilizes ourselves and our society. On the other hand, utter ambiguity in sexual mores removes boundaries and tends to promote the kind of alienation that weakens trust. Indeed, distrust for others—which the General Social Survey indicates has surged in the past 40 years—weakens personal relationships and certainly weakens a sense of true community.

At the moment, we seem to have lost our bearings. It feels like we’re in a free fall with a rickety parachute. An inevitable splat moment looms, though it hasn’t quite registered for most of us.

We should be working to stop this insanity in its tracks and not be silent about it, no matter how much the PC crowd blathers and smears us for pointing out the obvious. As we take in the landscape, we ought to be feeling pretty nauseous about now. Sick as a dog, in fact.

Fifty-Six Shades Of Gender Insanity,"As a former transgender, I am concerned with the attempts underway to change the words we use for gender:

Facebook expanded its possible designation of gender to 56 choices last year, with the explicit help of LGBT organizations.

Public and private universities are teaching a similar LGBT version of gender in human sexuality and public health courses. Professors and administrators are telling students that gender is more than male and female—in fact, those designations are simple and passé.

The new term for those who live life in their birth gender is “cisgender,” or “cis” for short, to distinguish them from “transgender.”

The list reads like something out of a comedy routine, except it isn’t funny when people who need psychological treatment don’t seek it because they see their condition in a list of “normal” genders. They will miss out on hope—the hope that they aren’t stuck in confusion. My concern is that they won’t get treatment, which can help prevent anti-social behaviors and regrettable suicides.

Fostering Confusion Exacerbates Suffering

It used to be that the men with behaviors such as cross-dressing, sexual fetish, transvestite or drag queen dress-up, female impersonation, and taking cross-gender hormones were considered to have psychological disorders. Some were homosexual; some not. Now, the pressure is on to insist that our society accepts and tolerates all oddities as mainstream.

The pressure is on to insist that our society accepts and tolerates all oddities as mainstream.

It used to be that those who suffered from gender confusion and distress were considered to have a mental disorder. That’s all changed now with the politicizing of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association. Gender confusion is not a disorder anymore, it’s a dysphoria, and as such, it shouldn’t be treated as something to overcome.

Gender distress is now something to embrace and enhance. “You’re born that way,” they say. Take a new gender name from the list of 56 possibilities, take hormones, and perhaps even have surgery to change your body to match your mental image. Get a new birth certificate and be granted equal status with those born in your adopted gender.

Gender Confusion Is Not Biological, It’s Psychological

But what does the research say? Has any biological basis been found that indicates who will develop into a transgender? Is there a genetic marker in transgenders? The answer is no. Researchers have looked for evidence to prove that transgenders are different biologically but they haven’t found any.

One study published in 2014 looked at certain suspected areas of the brain for an association with male-to-female (MtF) transsexualism and found none.

Another study, published in 2009, looked for “evidence that genetic variants of sex hormone-related genes confer individual susceptibility to MtF or FtM transsexualism” and didn’t find any.

Yet another study, published in 2013, found that “gender disorder does not seem to be associated with any molecular mutations of some of the main genes involved in sexual differentiation.”

Not a smidgeon of abnormality can be found in the genetic makeup of transgenders so, no, transgenders are not born that way. They are normal males and females.

What researchers have found is that transgenders attempt suicide at an alarming rate.

What researchers have found is that a majority of transgenders have at least one psychiatric co-existing (co-morbid) disorder, the most prevalent being major depressive disorder, specific phobia and adjustment disorder.

What researchers have found is that transgenders attempt suicide at an alarming rate.

What researchers have found is that 30 percent of gender dysphoria patients have a lifetime diagnosis of dissociative disorder (formerly called multiple personality disorder). Dissociative disorder and gender dysphoria appear very similar, and clinicians often cannot distinguish between the two in the transgender patient.

I think psychologists quickly default to the diagnosis of gender dysphoria and don’t consider the possibility of other disorders. I know: this is what happened with me. The most highly regarded gender specialist in the nation diagnosed me with gender dysphoria. He told me that I was a transgender and recommended that I undergo surgery to transition from male to female. All my discomfort would go away after surgery, he said. He was wrong.

Surgery Can’t Define Who I Am

I lived eight years successfully as a transgender female, but after the initial euphoria wore off, I was still confused and even more depressed. Having surgery and living fully as a woman didn’t alleviate the distress. Later, when I received the proper diagnosis and treatment of my dissociative disorder, I no longer needed to play the role of a woman and I regretted that I had been duped by the redefinition madness. The surgery can’t define who I am. The idea of 56 different genders is repugnant to this former transgender. I am a man, not some nonsense name contrived by the LGBT.

The idea of 56 different genders is repugnant to this former transgender. I am a man, not some nonsense name contrived by the LGBT.

I report stories of regret at the website sexchangeregret.com because today’s social-political correctness would have us believe that no one regrets sex change. But for some transgenders, regret is real. People contact me with their painful stories and tell me they feel all alone. Some are contemplating suicide because they are so despondent over having had needless surgery. Most had difficult childhood experiences that haven’t yet been resolved. Many want to return to their birth gender. All of them tell me that, for them, being a transgender is crazy-making.

My concern is that providing 56 different gender identities deters people who are in gender confusion or distress from seeking proper treatment, which needlessly places them at risk for unhealthy behaviors and possibly suicide. The organizations that propose this apparently are willing to spend time devising new designations and recommending irreversible surgery, but hostile to uncovering the psychological or psychiatric disorders that often accompany gender distress and lead to the high rate of suicide and suicide attempts.

President Obama’s Trans National Strategy,"Last month, for the first time since 2010, the Obama administration issued a National Security Strategy. It’s the first time ever that such a document has identified transgenderism as relevant to our vital national security interests. In it, the administration pledges to champion LGBT equality as a core value in America, and promote this value abroad.

Two passages stand out. The first is on page 20:“We will be a champion for communities that are too frequently vulnerable to violence, abuse, and neglect—such as ethnic and religious minorities; people with disabilities; Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) individuals; displaced persons; and migrant workers.”

Women, by the way, are covered in a whole paragraph following this excerpt. But the passage above is interesting not just for its selection of communities the National Security Strategy highlights, but for those demographics it entirely omits. The elderly and children, for example, are extremely vulnerable to abuse and violence. Unlike the small fraction of 1 percent who identify as transgender, the aged and children are sizable and vulnerable minorities, but they are neglected in this National Security Strategy.

So what gives? In the broader context of Obama’s sex and gender politics, transgender issues seem to be taking a position of critical importance in the White House efforts to reinvent us all. This follows naturally enough from our president’s evolution from paying lip service to traditional marriage to open advocacy of same-sex marriage. State endorsement of the reinvention of sexual relationships in marriage blends almost seamlessly into state endorsement of the reinvention of sex and gender distinctions.

And—voila!—in December, Attorney General Eric Holder announced in a memo that Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination “on the basis of sex,” shall henceforth be read to include gender identity. This year’s State of the Union address was the first to mention the word “transgender.”

All of this seems to be on its own inevitable trajectory to push transgenderism hard from above. Thus the question: why a national security spotlight on gender identity now after all these years?

Transgender Hyperdrive and the Military

We can always ask if it’s just political payoff to the well-monied LGBT lobby. That’s possible, but skims the surface. If it is merely a pay-off, we would at least all be justified in questioning whether that’s an appropriate use of a National Security Strategy. But given the administration’s focus, it seems far more likely there are other reasons that gender confusion has become a vital national security interest.

So what else?

Let’s take a look at the second relevant excerpt, on page 21 of the 2015 National Security Strategy document, under the heading “Empower Civil Society and Young Leaders:”

Restrictions are often seen through new laws and regulations that deny groups the foreign funding they depend on to operate, that criminalize groups of people like the LGBT community, or deny political opposition groups the freedom to assemble in peaceful protest. The United States is countering this trend by providing direct support for civil society and by advocating rollback of laws and regulations that undermine citizens’ rights.

It’s not a stretch to see putting these LGBT references into the National Security Strategy not only as a goal of exporting the LGBT agenda, but as a way of pressuring military leaders to accept openly transgender individuals in the armed forces. Last year, former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel noted that he was open to reviewing the military’s policy on the service of transgender individuals. Hagel’s recently confirmed successor, Ashton Carter, is positively enthusiastic. During a recent town hall with soldiers in Kandahar, Afghanistan, one audience member asked this “quick question:” “What are your thoughts on transgender service members serving in an austere environment like this here in Kandahar?”

It’s a way of pressuring military leaders to accept openly transgender individuals in the armed forces.

Carter answered: “I come at this kind of question from a fundamental starting point, which is that we want to make our conditions and experience of service as attractive as possible to our best people in our country. And I’m very open-minded about — otherwise about what their personal lives and proclivities are, provided they can do what we need them to do for us. That’s the important criteria.”

President Obama quickly echoed and applauded Carter’s answer. Holder’s new and expansive interpretation of the word “sex” greatly magnifies the power and reach of the Justice Department to prosecute businesses and individuals, or any entity that appears out of line with gender identity non-discrimination. Expect to see it used to put down any corner of resistance to transgenderism in the military.

From Openly Transgender Soldiers to a Sex-Less Society

A protective reference in the strategy also helps to render impotent arguments from military leaders that open transgenderism might in some way harm good order and discipline. Of course, the LGBT reference in the National Security Strategy has to do with promoting American values of equality and non-discrimination. So in this context, it is very likely intended to further boost pressure to lift the ban on military service by openly transgender individuals.

The underlying presumption in all of these laws is that everybody’s sex is arbitrarily ‘assigned.’

The pressure seems to be working. While some military leaders resisted President Clinton’s push for accepting openly gay service members in the 1990s, we hear barely a whisper on transgenderism.

We might also ask why pushing open transgenderism into the military is so important to the Obama administration. Throughout history, real cultural and societal changes come about gradually, inspired from society’s grassroots. But the LGBT agenda has been orchestrated and pushed extremely hard by elites from the top down. Resistance seems based on an unarticulated gut understanding that transgender non-discrimination laws actually do something very different than promote equality: they redefine the humanity of us all. Read any one of these laws, including the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, and you will understand that the underlying presumption in all of them is that everybody’s sex is arbitrarily “assigned” or arbitrarily “designated” at birth.

This is a presumption of seismic proportions because gender confusion puts us on a trajectory to legally erase everybody’s sex. And, in fact, removing sex distinctions at birth, presumably on birth certificates is a stated goal of the transgender project. Such a change forced on high would collapse under the weight of reality and public resistance.

However, the American military is the perfect answer to force dramatic and rapid change in the one segment of the society that is admissibly “authoritarian.” If military officers must salute and make the best of the situation whether they like it or not, the forced change is less likely to implode. Acceptance in the military, then, in turn helps push the agenda in the wider society, more gradually perhaps, but faster than would otherwise be the case.

At this point some may note that Harry Truman integrated the military and this is no different. Sorry, but race has nothing to do with behavior. Whether there is a genetic component to homosexuality and transgenderism is irrelevant here, because they only manifest themselves as behaviors that involve sex as both an activity and as an identity. Without the behavior, they are not visible.

Whether there is a genetic component to homosexuality and transgenderism is irrelevant here, because they only manifest themselves as behaviors that involve sex as both an activity and as an identity.

The changes would be wrenching. Gender identity, especially once proclaimed, requires transitioning on the part of every beholder—in this case the military—as well as the transgender. We are fast moving to a chaotic phase in which switching genders is legal without surgery or hormones, but by simple proclamation. Transgenderism can also mean claiming both genders, no gender at all, or being “gender fluid.”

A military subject to such mysteries and potential accusations of discrimination on a constant basis cannot function as it should. At the core of military culture is the ability to maintain discipline and regulate behavior. If the military is not allowed to deal with potentially disruptive and distracting behaviors, then it is no longer a military. It’s fair to wonder if the entire point of injecting the LGBT agenda into the American military is to destroy it.

Cultural Imperialism and Exporting LGBT

Finally, we ought to ask if a primary purpose of including the LGBT agenda in the U.S. National Security Strategy is to export it as a “universal value.” That would seem logical. Many nations—particularly developing nations, but also powers like Russia and India—do not yet share the Obama administration’s level of enthusiasm for same-sex marriage and transgenderism. The global component of Obama’s trans-agenda should fascinate us. Just six years ago he proclaimed marriage as the union between one man and one woman. He was not public about his strong support for the transgender law project until very recently.

Just six years ago Obama proclaimed marriage as the union between one man and one woman.

But his support is now quite open and emphatically global. Last year, Secretary of State John Kerry threatened to cut off funding to developing countries that don’t embrace the LGBT agenda. New U.S. ambassadors are on post as gay activists. U.S. embassies have flown the gay pride rainbow flag under the American flag, including the embassy in Tel Aviv and in Madrid.

And the State Department chose to use May 15, 2014, the International Day of Families, to stay silent on families, while issuing a joint statement with Finland to recognize the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia (May 17) instead. The statement promoted the need “to focus mutual efforts on combatting human rights abuses against LGBT persons, wherever they occur,” which presumably means policing other cultures not with the program.

Those sound like fighting words. If only the administration were willing to do the same for the millions of persecuted Christians, or the 21 victims ISIS beheaded last month specifically for being Christian but whose faith the White House would not even acknowledge.

Why We Have a Military

One of the best known transgender military figures today is former Navy SEAL Christopher/Kristin Beck, and he seems way too preoccupied now with the hair/make-up/dress routine. All say he served well. But he served as a man. The dynamics of an openly transgender Navy SEAL today would prove distracting, to say the least. (If military transgenders serving openly are just as obsessed with appearances as this Slovenian major, then we’re in for a wild ride with open transgenderism.)

The percentage of military volunteers from the transgender community is twice as high as the percentage from the general population.

According to a recent report by the Williams Institute, which is dedicated to sexual orientation and transgender law, an estimated 8,800 transgender personnel are currently on active duty. The report also notes that transgender individuals have a strong attraction to the military: the percentage of volunteers from the transgender community is twice as high as the percentage from the general population.

I think it’s fair to say that no service member’s life and safety should depend upon anyone who is allowed to openly fixate on what he or she looks like, or who cares that much about how they are perceived physically or in other ways by everybody else. And no service member’s life should depend upon someone who insists everybody must follow specific though changeable language and pronoun protocols that are at odds with physical reality. At the end of the day, this is what the political cult of transgenderism is about. And it’s gathering the force of law behind it.

Ultimately, we have a military to defend our nation and protect our Constitution. Forcing open transgenderism into the military is not a vital national security interest, but more of a national security threat.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/03/16/president-obamas-trans-national-strategy/,2015-03-16
"Gay Marriage Isn’t About Justice, It’s About Selma Envy","Why do so many young adults paint absurd caricatures of Christians who request government protection of their religious freedoms, arguing their true goal is to ban gay men from sitting at the local lunch counter? Why do they spread falsehoods about legislation, insisting that bills like the one recently signed by Indiana Gov. Mike Pence will unleash a Republican-led Jim Crow revival aimed at the LGBT community? Why do so many people, Gen Xers and younger, invent a monster of anti-gay bigotry and keep screaming the monster is real despite a mountain of contrary facts standing before them?

The answer is “social studies.” My generation engages in straw men, misinformation, and lies because, in every year of social studies class, we studied the civil-rights movement not as history, but as hagiography. We didn’t just learn what events happened on American soil, we were encouraged to mimic the segregation-defeating holy ones and merit for ourselves a place alongside them in glory. Combining that admonition with our general aversion to hard work, we concluded that the only thing necessary to be as righteous as the saints who fought racial injustice was to decry an injustice that no one else was. And we became so desperate to find that injustice, we lost our minds in the process.

Once upon a time, my generation learned in first-grade social studies, everyone thought it was good to hate African-Americans. But then a group of saintly figures arose who were better human beings than the rednecks from the South, and they changed the world for the better. This story captivated us, and we wanted to change the world, too.

Once, black Americans weren’t allowed to use the same bathrooms as white Americans, we learned the next year, but the holy warriors of progress came along and saved the day. As just as much as we wanted to rescue damsels in distress, Superman style, we wanted to have our own victims to rescue from the forces of bigotry.

The saintly song of the civil-rights movement grew even more rapturous as we grew old enough for our American history teachers to pop a tape in the VCR and show us the gruesome images of the era. Look, children! Look at this sneering face of Southern hatred! Look at these enemies of progress holding the firehoses! These were not human beings corrupted by their circumstances and giving in to the vilest impulses that lurk in the hearts of all men. No, these were demons, evil embodied in human flesh. Look again, children! Look at the faces of these saints who used non-violent protests to fight for equality and change legislation. These are the faces of the morally superior, the holy ones who marched on Selma, those who were more enlightened, more compassionate, more loving than anyone else who had ever lived because they defended the mistreated and defeated discrimination when no one else would.

More than we wanted to find the perfect prom date, we wanted to find our own bigotry to eradicate. After years of hearing those saints sing “We Shall Overcome,” we were overcome with jealousy. We coveted Selma. We envied that march. We looked at that footage and hungered for our own cause to devour.

Just Give Me a Hashtag Campaign

Cruelly, the Lord of Social Justice wouldn’t grant us a cause, at least not an easy one. Sure, we could march against Roe v. Wade and defend the unborn. But opposing abortion would have required us to adopt sex lives consistent with that position. No more hookup culture, no more consequence-free sex, no more placing our own desires over the needs of children. Opposing Planned Parenthood would never be our cause. It would have cost us too much fun.

Opposing Planned Parenthood would never be our cause. It would have cost us too much fun.

Likewise, fighting poverty couldn’t possibly be our Selma. The annoying thing about defending the poor is that the poor need money, and we had student loans to pay. And sex trafficking wasn’t any more attractive. To be holy, you need a cause no one else supports, least of all those wretched white Southern fundamentalists. While forcing women into prostitution is certainly bad, what’s the point of speaking against it if Jerry Falwell agrees with you?

Then, one day, manna descended from heaven in the form of gay marriage. Here it was! The cause we’d longed for all these years had finally arrived! Here was an injustice no one had ever opposed before. Here was a group of marginalized people no one had ever defended. So by embracing this cause, we would instantly be more compassionate, more accepting, more saintly than every human being who had ever lived.

What did it cost us to embrace this cause? Absolutely nothing! It required no moral consistency, no financial sacrifice, no effort. We could sleep with as many people as we wanted, divorce as many people as we wanted, father and then abandon as many children as our hearts desired, and lose no credibility. We could spend our entire adult lives defecating on the institution of marriage and this could not sully our gay marriage halos.

On top of that, these oppressed souls were so gainfully employed that they paid for their own lawyers and lobbyists, so we didn’t need to give them a cent. All we had to do was change our profile pictures on Facebook and beatification was ours. Our prayers were answered. The bright, shiny diamond of righteousness no other generation could claim had been placed into our hands.

Don’t Let Facts Sully Our Self-Righteousness

But after all those years of waiting for that diamond to arrive, we weren’t going to let anyone to tell us what we held in our hands was really a cubic zirconia. This cause made us righteous. We were certain of it, so no opposition was allowed. No debate on the issue could be tolerated. No damn, dirty facts would take our saintly status away.

Of course we know that politely telling a customer you’ve served for nine years that you can’t, in good conscience, provide flowers for his wedding isn’t in the same moral universe as murdering a black teenager for talking to a white woman.

So when you argued that disapproving of gay marriage didn’t deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as oppression of black Americans, we knew you were right. Of course we know that politely telling a customer you’ve served for nine years that you can’t, in good conscience, provide flowers for his wedding isn’t in the same moral universe as murdering a black teenager for talking to a white woman. Of course saying “you don’t get to vote because your skin has a different amount of melanin than mine” is logically indefensible, while saying “I don’t think a union that’s biologically incapable of procreation fits the definition of marriage” is an argument that needs to be fairly considered, even if we don’t agree with it. But we wouldn’t consider it, wouldn’t even let your words embed in our ears because we would not risk having to surrender our halos in the offhand chance that you maybe, sort of, kind of had a little bit of a point.

Likewise, when you insisted that not all opposition to homosexuality is created equal, we knew this was true. We knew the vast majority of you would never have assaulted a gay classmate or kicked your lesbian daughter out on the street. We knew that you have gay friends, gay siblings, gay uncles that you love, cherish, laugh with, and have over for Thanksgiving Dinner while still not approving of that one particular aspect of their lives. We knew that you look at your gay children with the same ratio of love and disapproval as a devout Catholic mother who would give her life for her atheist son yet weeps that his children aren’t baptized. We objectively know you’re not hateful bigots. But we called you that anyway because, in order to keep our righteousness shiny, someone had to play the role of Bull Connor, and you were the best fit we could find.

Lies and Coverups Against Religious Liberty

On the issue of religious liberty, we were just as recalcitrant. Of course we support the overarching protections of conscience offered in the Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and in similar laws or constitutional interpretations found in 30 other states. Of course we understood that this bill would provide a day in court to every citizen, gay, straight, Methodist or Muslim, if he believed that the state government or a private party was infringing upon his right to live according to the dictates of his conscience. Of course we support religious groups like the UDV appealing to laws of this nature to keep sacramentally smoking their hallucinogenic tea.

But we had already laced up our boots for the march on New Selma and we’re weren’t going to take them off just because the modern-day segregationists wouldn’t do us the courtesy of existing.

But we still misrepresented the bill, lied about it, shared articles on social media that labeled the legislation as intentionally, undeniably anti-gay, and dismissingly enclosed the phrase “religious liberty” in scare quotes. Just as we did with such success in Arizona, we screamed that this bill would unlock the gates of hell and allow a horde of bigoted devils to deny Hoosier homosexuals a chicken salad sandwich, all while knowing that, because sexual orientation isn’t a protected class in Indiana, these beasts have already been free to do so this entire time and yet, annoyingly, chose not to. But we had already laced up our boots for the march on New Selma and we’re weren’t going to take them off just because the modern-day segregationists wouldn’t do us the courtesy of existing.

Just as our desire to believe that we really were as holy as the civil-rights saints was so strong that we willingly slandered the opposition and lied about the legislation, so we made ourselves impervious to shame and irony in defense of our newfound righteousness. We looked to the icon of racial equality, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a man whose greatest accomplishments included spearheading nationwide non-violent protests, preaching peace, giving speeches, and writing letters that will live forever in the annals of American history, and we felt not an ounce of humiliation when the best prophet we could place beside him was George Takei, a man whose greatest accomplishments include pretending to fly a spaceship on TV and sharing funny pictures of cats on the Internet.

And what form of protest did Takei threaten as Pence prepared to sign the accursed bill into law? Sit-ins? Bus boycotts? No, he threatened that a gaming convention would move out of Indianapolis. Our leader didn’t say, “I have a dream,” he said, “If you sign this bill that we’re all pretending says something it doesn’t, a bunch of grown men who pretend to be fictional characters will pretend to be fictional characters in another state that we’re pretending won’t almost certainly have an identical law already on the books.” How can any self-respecting person not explode in a ball of humiliation when comparing Selma with Gen Con, you ask? We don’t need self-respect anymore. We sacrificed it to keep the cause and our moral superiority.

Give Us Self-Righteousness Or Else

Once upon a time in social studies class, my generation learned that moral righteousness was found in opposing an injustice that nobody else opposed. And when we found that injustice, nobody was going to take away our long-desired holiness. So as we march on, don’t expect things to change. We will continue misleading, lying, and slandering. We will continue calling people bigots and klansmen, not because we’re actually debating them, but because those are the words of the spiritual songs we sing as we press toward glory and polish our LGBT halos.

We will continue calling people bigots and klansmen, not because we’re actually debating them, but because those are the words of the spiritual songs we sing as we press toward glory and polish our LGBT halos.

Likewise, we will continue linking the civil-rights movement with the push for gay acceptance without pausing for a second to consider the comparison. We will continue diminishing the bravery of Rosa Parks by claiming a seat beside her as our reward for the one time we boycotted Chick-Fil-A for a month. We will trivialize the death of Medgar Evers by praising his blood for freeing gay couples to financially ruin a florist who hurt their feelings instead of walking one more block to find another purveyor of petunias who was happy to take their money.

In the Kingdom of Heaven, countless children of God will embrace the older saints who gave them lives of far greater dignity on earth by following Christ’s example and enduring insults, beatings, imprisonments, and even death for them. We know this and yet we will insist that we’re owed an equal measure of honor because we tweeted our support for every gay kiss on “Glee.”

From the days of our youth, my generation hungered for a cause that would make us as righteous as the saints who marched on Selma. We have found that cause. We have sunk our teeth into that righteousness and, at this point, we couldn’t care less if it’s real. The Lord of Social Justice has finally answered our prayers. And Lord help the bigot who comes between us and our cause.

The Kids Are Not Alright: A Lesbian’s Daughter Speaks Out,"Dear LGBT Community,

I am not your daughter. I never carried a flag in one of your gay pride parades. I have never written a letter on your behalf to a congressman or anyone else, and I have never felt the need to make people accept the fact I am the daughter of a lesbian. Perhaps it’s because she never felt the need to force people to accept her for being one.

No, I would never align myself to a community as intolerant and self-absorbed as the LGBT community, a community that demands tolerance with fervor and passion, yet does not give it in return, even to its own members at times. In fact, this community attacks anyone who does not agree with them, no matter how lovingly any difference of opinion is expressed.

I myself am a product of the Lesbian Revolution of the 1980s. My mother always knew she liked girls, but tried hard to be a good, straight, southern Baptist girl. When I was a year old, she left my dad for another man, whom we lived with until I was somewhere around four years old. After the divorce, she told my father to leave, which he did, and in his own words, “I did because I knew I couldn’t fight the entire family to see you.” I cannot remember the man she left him for very well, but I can remember being happy living with him. It did not last, however, and when she left him, she left him for a woman.

Silencing People about Homosexuality Won’t Change What Kids Can See

I knew from a young age that living with two women was not natural. I could especially see it in the homes of my friends who had a mom and a dad. I spent as much time with those friends as I possibly could. I yearned for the affection that my friends received from their dads. I wanted to know what it was like to be held and cherished by a man, what it was like to live with one from day to day.

I yearned for the affection that my friends received from their dads.

As far as I was concerned, I already had one mother; I did not need another. My dream was that my mother would decide she wanted to be with men again, but obviously that dream did not come true. My grandfathers and uncles did the best they could when it came to spending time with me and doing all the daddy-daughter stuff, but it was not the same as having a full-time father, and I knew it. It always felt secondhand.

Growing up without the presence of a man in my home damaged me personally. All I wanted from the time I was a little girl was a normal family. When I graduated high school, my thoughts were not entirely where they needed to be. While my friends were excited about college, a piece of me was missing, and I knew I would never feel whole until I found it.

Men Need Women Need Men

I had a desire unlike any other to create my own family and have stability, and this led to two extremely unhealthy relationships. Luckily, I found my way out of both, but after being hurt and used so badly, I decided happiness just was not meant for me. Shortly afterwards, I met my husband, and everything clicked. For the first time, I felt alive and complete. Having children and seeing a man parent a child for the first time was beautiful and awe-inspiring. It only reinforced my belief that a child needs a mother and a father, and that same-sex parenting and single parenting are far inferior to heterosexual parenting when done correctly.

As an adult, I have tried to talk to my mom about how difficult my life was, but she simply cannot relate because she was raised by a mom and a dad.

Knowing next to nothing about males is hardly all that was hard about being raised by two women. It probably comes as no surprise that growing up in Podunk, Oklahoma, was not a walk in the park. Unlike other kids who were apparently raised in gay utopias, I grew up very alone and isolated. I was an only child and there weren’t other kids around like me to talk with and relate to. No one I knew understood what I struggled with each day, and I had no option but to keep it all inside.

As an adult, I have tried to talk to my mom about how difficult my life was, but she simply cannot relate because she was raised by a mom and a dad. As a child, I would not have spoken out about the way I was being raised, either. I love my mom. She was the center of my universe and the thought of saying something to outsiders that would have hurt her devastated me. Writing this letter right this very moment is devastating me.

Gay People and Their Children Don’t All Think Alike

But I am doing it anyway. I am doing it because people need to know that it is not all roses. The effects of growing up the way I did still plays a part in my life today. I was beyond self-conscious as a child, and constantly worried about what others thought of me. I was always terrified of someone finding out my mom was a lesbian and then wanting nothing to do with me. For most of my life, the perceived opinions of others have dominated, and only recently have I been able to let that go.

The studies claiming we are just as well or better off than our peers raised by straight parents are hardly scientific in most cases, and do not represent us all.

That is only the tip of the iceberg. The studies claiming we are just as well or better off than our peers raised by straight parents are hardly scientific in most cases, and do not represent us all. People need to know that some children of gay parents do not agree with gay adoption and marriage, just like some gay people themselves don’t agree with it, either! But you will notice that fact is not making headlines.

The Huffington Post published two responses to Heather Barwick’s recent letter here at The Federalist, and both were written by people who were raised with members of the opposite sex in the home—a male raised by women, and a female who had brothers present. It makes total sense that their experiences were not like mine and Heather’s, since we were both raised by women.

And just because one product of artificial insemination does not feel she was robbed does not mean others don’t. I am aware there are kids out there who disagree with my point of view, just like there are gays out there who disagree with the LGBT community’s point of view. But to suggest this is not a reason to validate and listen to a handful of children raised by gays, and who are against it, is ridiculous. After all, it is but a handful of people demanding we redefine marriage and parenting, and we all see how well that’s going.

Not Yours,

Why Does the Left Kowtow to Islam?,"The American left has spent the past few weeks trying to tell us that they believe in free speech, but…—and the “but” is that anything that offends the sensibilities of Islamic fanatics is unnecessarily provocative, hateful, and possibly racist. Therefore, such “hate speech” shouldn’t be allowed.

Now they’ve gotten a taste of their own medicine.

An anti-censorship benefit scheduled for next month in New York City has been cancelled after the managers of the venue, the Sheen Center, “suggested that we alter the title of Neil LaBute’s play”—charmingly titled Mohammed Gets a Boner—”and alter the content of some of our panelists’ speeches.”

That’s right, folks. They tried to censor an anti-censorship event.

Well, not censorship in its truest sense. The managers of the venue do have a right to say what can and cannot go on there, and in this case, they didn’t act out of fear of attack. Rather, the Sheen Center is funded by the Archdiocese of New York, which has its own vested interest in discouraging mockery of religion. But the irony is that, after weeks of saying it’s “hate speech” to deliberately offend Muslims, intellectuals on the left can hardly complain, even though they are the ones getting kicked to the curb this time.

The various panels on the event were slated to discuss “censorship of women in the arts,” “censorship of environmentalists and climate scientists,” and “censorship of LGBT artists.” The part about “censorship of environmentalists” is, of course, laughable. And these days, the only artists who are forced to recant their views are those who violate the LGBT speech codes by pointing out that Bruce Jenner isn’t a woman. So while the organizers of this event were preparing to work themselves up into a frenzy of concern over non-existent censorship, they inadvertently reminded us of the censorship threat we should actually fear.

[Update: the event will go on at a new venue—but without LaBute’s play, because the organizers “said the event ‘was always supposed to be about building bridges, sharing points of view, and trying to ease tensions rather than create them.'” So they’re against censorship, unless that offends someone.]

This raises a big question, one of the great paradoxes of our era. Why is it that a large segment of left has embraced a code of appeasing “sensitivity” toward Islam—when they are its obvious next victims? Why do they wring their hands over “microagressions,” while urging us not to provoke people who execute homosexuals and throw acid in women’s faces?

Why does the left kowtow to Islam?

You might suspect that the question answers itself. They kowtow to Islam precisely because it is a real threat, a macroaggression that trumps all of the microaggressions. So you could say that it is simple cowardice. They protest against people they know are extremely unlikely to harm them, and they shut up about the fanatics who might actually follow through on their threats.

But I don’t think that’s the fundamental cause. After all, most lefties are not being called upon to take any personal risk, because somebody else has already stuck his neck out. Drawing or publishing a cartoon of Mohammed might get you put on an al-Qaeda hit list. Simply saying that you support the cartoonist’s defiance of that threat won’t get you on anybody’s list.

In fact, a running theme of the left’s arguments, repeated with a great deal of apparent sincerity, is the notion that it is irrational to fear Islam, that describing the religion as violent and dangerous is “Islamophobia.” They seem to have largely talked themselves into believing that they have nothing personally to fear from Islam. Jihadists may throw gays off of buildings in Syria, but it can’t happen here.

This is nonsense, of course, but it is revealing of the mindset. They actually talk themselves into believing that “censorship of LGBT artists” is an equal or even greater threat, far more urgent than anything having to do with Islam. For the left, the main source of evil in the world always comes from within America and from within the West, never outside of it.

In this respect, one of the most revealing responses was Jeffery Tayler’s attempt to persuade Salon’s “Progressive” readers that they should take the threat of Islam more seriously. It’s actually pretty good—once you get past all the throat-clearing about the evils of the West, blaming “Europe’s colonial past and the United States’ current (endless) military campaigns in the Islamic world, as well as prejudice against nonwhites in Europe.” Or this long paragraph making sure to inveigh equally against Christianity.

Enter the God of the Israelites. Jealous and vengeful, capricious and megalomaniacal, He issued His Decalogue. What is Commandment Number One? “You shall have no other gods before Me”—an absolutist order implicitly justifying violence against those who haven’t gotten the memo. Even after “gentle Jesus meek and mild” entered the picture, Tyrannus Deus continued His brutal reign, with legions of His Medieval votaries waging crusades against rival monotheists in the Holy Land, hurling themselves into battle as they cried Deus vult! (God wills it!) And, of course, with Jesus came (the highly non-gentle, non-meek, non-mild) idea of eternal torment in hell as divine retribution for sin—surely no inducement to peace and tranquility, either.

That’s an awful lot of throat-clearing, and by this point, you would almost forget this is an article warning against Islam. Which shows that Taylor (who elsewhere describes Ted Cruz as “our ayatollah”) knows his audience well. To even begin to tell them that radical Islam is a threat, you have to assure them that you, too, hate Fox News and Western Christians, and that you fear them just as much as radical Muslims, possibly more.

The point is that the left doesn’t kowtow to Islam because they actually love Islam, but rather because they hate our own culture. They have been steeped in a narrative about how American and Western culture is racist and “imperialist,” and they’ve been trained to see anyone with a dark complexion and a non-Western origin as the victim of our crimes. When they see criticism of Islam, or deliberate attempts to defy Islam, they filter it through that narrative. They see it as: there go those bigoted right-wing Christians, demeaning dark-skinned foreigners again. So they reflexively oppose it.

See the rationale offered by the writers who protested the PEN award given to Charlie Hebdo, the French satirical magazine whose staff was murdered by jihadists early this year. If ever anyone was a martyr for free speech, they were. But the PEN writers denounced the award as “cultural intolerance” which showed a “blindness to the cultural arrogance of the French nation, which does not recognize its moral obligation to a large and disempowered segment of their population.” Leftist icon Garry Trudeau declared that “by attacking a powerless, disenfranchised minority with crude, vulgar drawings closer to graffiti than cartoons, Charlie wandered into the realm of hate speech.” So, as one of the writers put it, this is not something for Americans “to be self-righteous about.”

This is shallow and condescending. Equating the Charlie Hebdo murderers with a “disenfranchised minority” of French Muslims implies that all Muslims are terrorists, which is precisely what we’re told we’re not supposed to think. Meanwhile, Bosch Fawstin, the illustrator of the winning cartoon at the Garland event, is an ex-Muslim of Albanian descent. And when leftists validate a Muslim prohibition against offensive cartoons, they think they are denouncing Western provocateurs like Pamela Geller and Geert Wilders; instead, they are selling out people like Atena Farghadani, a young woman imprisoned in Iran for drawing cartoons considered insulting to the Islamist regime.

But anyone who knows the left knows that the narrative, once established, is nearly impossible to kill. It must be preserved because it serves as a source of personal identity and moral authority. In fact, you can pretty much ignore everything and skip right to that last quote from the PEN protest, because it’s what everything else is really about: that America should not believe in its own rightness. The left seeks to gain moral authority, not from what they are for, but from what they are against. If you look at the history of the left, you find that they have frequently changed their favorite causes and their vision of the ideal society, often in ways that are wildly contradictory. But the one thing that remains constant is what they oppose.

The left used to present themselves as hyper-industrial and super-technological. In H.G. Wells’s The Shape of Things to Come, the ideal future society was going to be ruled by a technological elite of airplane pilots, while the Soviets projected a grandiose vision of industrial giantism, with huge hydroelectric dams, steel mills, railroads, and chunky Bakelite telephones. Then the left flipped, and now they’re anti-industrial and their central crusades are to shut down power plants and to eat locally grown organic kale. You can frequently catch them making this flip in mid-conversation, as with an acquaintance I was talking to recently who expressed his concern for the plight of the poor under capitalism—and then a few minutes later, after I argued that hundreds of millions of people across the world have been lifted out of poverty by capitalism, he told me that Western affluence is overrated and destroys the environment. Everyone on the right has, at some point, had a conversation exactly like this, and it is maddening.

Or: if you go back and look at early 20th-century Progressivism, you will find it shot through with racism of the pseudo-scientific sort—Progressive icon Woodrow Wilson introduced segregation in the federal government—along with schemes for eugenics and a generally uncomplimentary view of homosexuals. Yet today’s Progressives claim the opposite position on these issues as one of their central virtues. Or: the left will champion insults to Christianity as so essential to free speech that they must be funded by the government—then regard insults to Islam as so inflammatory that they must be banned as “fighting words.”

So everything changes, but one thing stays the same. Capitalism is bad, the West is bad, America is vicious and corrupt and needs to be fundamentally transformed. Transformed into what? That’s always vague and subject to change without notice, and ultimately it doesn’t matter.

The left is fundamentally reactionary. It is a reaction against capitalism and against America. The left are defined by what they are against, or more accurately who they hate. So they are drawn to sympathy toward Islam because it is not-us: non-Western, non-American, neither Christian nor a product of the Enlightenment. And I guess that’s what the two ideologies have in common: they are both reactions against the supposed evils of the West. Which explains why leftists tend to find themselves uncomfortable and look for excuses to retreat when they are called upon to defend the West against this rival group of reactionaries.

The only corrective is to start over again from a very different starting point. Anyone who wants “progress” ought to start by asking how we achieved any in the first place. That would require some extended meditation on the virtues of the West, an appreciation of its achievements, an understanding of the ideas and values behind them—and a touch of self-righteousness that makes us too proud to kowtow to the enemies of those ideals.

LGBT Activists Arm For Further War On Free Speech,"Kirsten Powers’ new book, “The Silencing,” nails it by showing just how bad things have gotten for free speech in America. It’s going to get a whole lot worse, and I’ll explain why.

Powers has dubbed today’s intolerant purveyors of leftist causes the “the illiberal left” because, as a liberal herself, she sees them as anything but liberal about allowing a voice to those who don’t toe their rigid line. Her book catalogues and analyzes the dehumanization and demonization techniques the illiberal Left applies towards anyone who dares to veer from their rigid narratives. Their sacred cows include abortion, climate change, same-sex marriage, and second-wave feminism. Dissenters are systematically smeared and destroyed.

There is no small irony in the fact that the crazed reaction from the illiberal Left to Powers’ book demonstrates the very behaviors and attitudes she critiques. Social media immediately erupted with a hate-fest and swarmed Powers on Twitter, in exactly the manner described in her book. It’s yet another exercise in promoting groupthink and suppressing freedom of expression by those who want to tell us all what we must think.

But I would add that most of this is coming straight out of the Left’s holy of holies: the LGBT lobby (whose agenda Powers happens to support.) Because next up on the LGBT hit parade is the literal silencing of America—with the force of the federal government behind it.

Political Censorship in the LGBT Agenda

The American Unity Fund is a heavily funded new super-PAC looking to blanket the country with LGBT anti-discrimination laws. In effect, those laws aim to wipe out any alternative voice to the LGBT agenda. The effort is being spearheaded by billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Singer and another wealthy hedge fund manager, Tim Gill. Gill’s operations—the Gill Foundation and Gill Action—have been dedicated to “nonpartisan” gains for the LGBT lobby on the legislative and judicial fronts.

Of course, they can’t call their campaign ‘Three Cheers for Thought Policing in America’ or ‘Gag Orders for All Americans.’

But with an expected federal win for gay marriage from the Supreme Court, the LGBT movement is poised to shift its focus to policing speech in the workplace, schools, businesses, and public squares across America.

Of course, they can’t call their campaign “Three Cheers for Thought Policing in America” or “Gag Orders for All Americans.” So, instead, they’ve adopted the Orwellian slogan “Freedom for All Americans.” The intent of the slogan and campaign is to stir up the idea that we need a lot more anti-discrimination laws in America because there is so much bigotry and hate throughout this land of ours.

The ultimate goal of the campaign, according to The New York Times, is passage of a national LGBT anti-discrimination law. In the meantime, Singer and Gill, et al. will be pushing for ever more and ever stricter “anti-discrimination” and “anti-hate” laws in state legislatures.

The “Freedom for All Americans” rollout has been accompanied by other articles that champion the case for more anti-discrimination laws in the wake of an expected Supreme Court decision that would, for all practical purposes, federally ban recognition of marriage as a male-female institution.

Republicans and Conservatives are the Prime Targets

Since the Democrats, academia, Hollywood, and the media are already arms of the LGBT lobby, the basic thrust of the American Unity Fund’s “Freedom for All Americans” campaign/slogan/meme is to persuade those darned Republicans and pesky conservatives to set aside their principles and get with the program.

That old notion of civil rights was back in the days when the First Amendment remained intact for all to enjoy.

On the surface, this “Freedom for All” slogan sounds innocuous, almost like motherhood (to borrow a quaint notion). Who would ever support discrimination? But this is not your grandfather’s (another quaint notion) Civil Rights Act. Because that old notion of civil rights was back in the days when the First Amendment remained intact for all to enjoy.

The LGBT lobby has always known that it needs to get Republicans, conservatives, and evangelicals on board—through their leaders—because they still command a wide swath of America, and, worse, some people might not be intimidated enough to refrain from saying things not in line with the lobby’s agenda.

Hence, there are infiltration efforts like “Log Cabin Republicans,” whose sole purpose has been to promote the LGBT lobby while claiming to be conservative. Hence also, there have been unprecedented late night arm-twisting and back room deals with Democrat governors Andrew Cuomo in New York (2011) and Martin O’Malley in Maryland (2012) to get three Republican legislators each in their respective legislatures to cause—voila!—“bipartisan” passage of same-sex marriage. That was just the beginning. The LGBT lobby is now poised to go for the jugular.

Luring Dissenters, Then Gagging Them

The LGBT lobby has ways of making Americans talk. Or not talk. It has already been a significant catalyst for the silencing that is blanketing America.

There’s a lot of social psychology behind it, like coaxing out availability cascades and spirals of silence.

The coordinated strategy to coerce public opinion compliance with the LGBT agenda probably has its seeds in a manifesto-style 1989 book, “After the Ball,” by Marshall Kirk and Hunter Madsen. Of course, there’s a lot of social psychology behind it, like coaxing out availability cascades and spirals of silence. (Republicans are scandalously tuned out to these methods of persuasion. In fact, nary a single conservative social psychologist exists.)

Suffice it to say that the LGBT movement and its narrative have all of the push-and-pull ingredients for a bandwagon effect. These include the promise of sexual freedom, a libertarian veneer of promoting autonomy, the well-coordinated public smearing of dissenters, and the huge potential for emotional blackmail of LGBT family and friends. Look no further than the ninth edition of GLAAD’s media “guidebook” to understand media obedience to regulation of speech and press demanded by the LGBT lobby.

Paving a Path to Coercive Thought Reform

That, in very abbreviated form, is the history. Where is the “Freedom for All Americans” effort going?

One of the coordinators of the project, hedge fund manager Dan Loeb, told The New York Times that pushing for these laws is “critical in order to change understanding against gays.” In other words, the laws themselves are supposed to lead to a change in the public attitudes. Can laws really do this?

Laws intended to change how individuals think—about anything—require enforced silencing.

Notwithstanding the awkward construction, Loeb’s statement is loaded. To claim that more anti-discrimination laws are “critical in order to change understanding against gays” basically reveals that the professed purpose of these laws is coercive thought reform.

Laws intended to change how individuals think—about anything—require enforced silencing. If the “Freedom for All Americans” meme is about freedom (which it’s not), then it’s only about negative freedom. That is, freedom from “discrimination.” Freedom from “hate.” Which basically gives carte blanche to those holding power (ultimately, the state) to define and cherry pick whatever “discrimination” and “hate” may mean before granting whatever due process is left over for the accused.

So laws of this sort, hiding under the fig leaf of “anti-discrimination,” will give the state the power to police speech and behaviors.

Paving a Path to Coercive Collectivism

Coercive “unity” of the sort proposed by Singer, Gill, et al. in their “American Unity” means a collectivist type of unity that is not voluntary, but enforced in law. The actual enforcement mechanism for anti-discrimination measures might still be up in the air, but likely involves the creation of a host of new “human rights” commissions—basically hate tribunals set up on the local, state, and federal levels. This has already been done in Canada.

Powers has written a whole book that shows how our free-speech rights are being restricted. We already see the policing of private, personal conversations in places like Marquette University, where staff have been trained to inform authorities “right away” if they hear of any employee who does not support the LGBT agenda, even if it occurs in an overheard private conversation.

But if you continue to harbor doubts about what’s in store, let’s take a virtual trip up Canada way and see how it’s been working so far up there.

Canada’s Hate Tribunals Likely Reflect America’s Future

Canada legalized same-sex marriage in 2005. Once that was a done deal, “human rights commissions” were quickly set up. They operate municipally, provincially, and federally to surveil individuals and businesses for compliance. This is likely the sort of thing Singer, Gill, and their companions have in mind for the United States.

Canadian Dawn Stefanowicz recently published an article in Public Discourse: “A Warning from Canada: Same Sex Marriage Erodes Fundamental Rights.” She describes the utter surveillance society that is entrenched up there. It’s not just the wedding business that cannot legally be served by any conscientious objectors to participation in LGBT ceremonies. Every type of business is subject to the behavior modification that these laws push for.

Same-sex marriage also put Canada on the path to legally separate children from their biological parents across the board. So the silencing goes beyond public speech. Stefanowicz explains:

When same-sex marriage was legalized in Canada in 2005, parenting was immediately redefined. Canada’s gay marriage law, Bill C-38, included a provision to erase the term ‘natural parent’ and replace it across the board with gender-neutral ‘legal parent’ in federal law. Now all children only have ‘legal parents,’ as defined by the state. . . it is considered discriminatory to say that marriage is between a man and a woman or that every child should know and be raised by his or her biological married parents. It is not just politically incorrect in Canada to say so; you can be saddled with tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees, fined, and forced to take sensitivity training.

Such anti-discrimination laws serve to cultivate surveillance societies. And they are doing so in Canada:

Anyone who is offended by something you have said or written can make a complaint to the Human Rights Commissions and Tribunals. In Canada, these organizations police speech, penalizing citizens for any expression deemed in opposition to particular sexual behaviors or protected groups identified under ‘sexual orientation.’ It takes only one complaint against a person to be brought before the tribunal, costing the defendant tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees. The commissions have the power to enter private residences and remove all items pertinent to their investigations, checking for hate speech.

Stefanowicz goes on to explain how Canada’s bureaucracy is now set up to meddle freely in children’s relationships with their parents and to silence teachers in their private lives, all in the name of anti-discrimination. In fact, the pall is cast even in church in Canada, since informants are free to report anything they deem “hate speech” that comes from the pulpit or even congregants. So, according to Stefanowicz, “Most faith communities have become ‘politically correct’ to avoid fines and loss of charitable status.”

In the end, per Stefanowicz:

Americans need to prepare for the same sort of surveillance-society in America if the Supreme Court rules to ban marriage as a male-female institution. It means that no matter what you believe, the government will be free to regulate your speech, your writing, your associations, and whether or not you may express your conscience. Americans also need to understand that the endgame for some in the LGBT rights movement involves centralized state power—and the end of First Amendment freedoms.

The Brewing Storm

A few people woke up to the authoritarian nature and intent of the LGBT lobby after Mozilla CEO and Javascript inventor Brendan Eich was deposed last year for his thought crime: supporting marriage as the union of a man and a woman and not recanting.

Since the Eich episode, we’ve seen a virtual Kristallnacht campaign on wedding business owners who don’t get with the program. An amicus curiae brief to the Supreme Court that lists hundreds of big companies that promote gay marriage showcases itself like a monolithic battering ram aimed at all other businesses.

All of this should serve as a dead giveaway that the same-sex marriage meme is not about marriage. It’s not about equality. It’s not about civil rights. It’s about something else, something that involves rigid conformity. And we’re not supposed to talk about it.

Free Speech Is a Use-it-Or-Lose-It Proposition

Assuming the Supreme Court signs on to the same-sex marriage meme come June, we can expect to see a noose tightening around both public and private speech, including spontaneous conversation, in America. The ultimate effect of the “Freedom for All Americans” campaign will be to criminalize the expression of conservative as well as traditional religious thought on issues of marriage and family. In doing so, it will further stunt independent thought or debate in the wider political context.

To control relationships, central planners need to divide and conquer people by restricting their ability to communicate with one another.

Sadly, the LGBT lobby has served as a prime catalyst for mindless smearing. Charges of “homophobia” and “transphobia” in identity politics easily give way to other seemingly unrelated phobias diagnosed by the PC crowd, including poverty phobia and “Islamophobia.”

So we shouldn’t be surprised when folks like CNN host Chris Cuomo proclaim that “hate speech” should not be protected by the First Amendment. And the spectacle of the Constitution Center in Philadelphia hosting a “debate” on the state of free speech in America shouldn’t surprise us, either.

There’s so much to unpack here, but if pressed to dissect this vat of worms, I’d say that the Orwellian “Freedom for All Americans” meme boils down to the ancient urge to centralize power. That always begins with controlling people, which, in turn, requires the control of human relationships. To control relationships, central planners need to divide and conquer people by restricting their ability to communicate with one another.

The bottom line is that free speech is a use it or lose it proposition. That means speak now, or forever hold your peace.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/05/20/lgbt-activists-arm-for-further-war-on-free-speech/,2015-05-20
Mental Health’s LGBT Blind Spot,"A scene stands out to me from my graduate program in social work. A lesbian professor visited our class to tell about her experience of being same-sex attracted in a small, Midwestern, devoutly Protestant town in the latter twentieth century. As expected, her story was heart-rending.

Afterward, during the Q&A, a black woman in her 40s raised her hand. “I’ve noticed that the high school girls today go through phases where they say that they like girls, and then change their minds and say they like boys again, like it just goes back and forth. And I don’t know if they think it’s cute or what, but it seems to happen a lot these days. Do you have any thoughts on why that is?”

Before the speaker could offer a response, a young, outspoken lesbian student piped up. “I think a girl should be able to like whoever she wants to! If Susie wants to say she likes Joe one week, then Julie the next, then Bobby the week after that, that’s her choice and nobody else’s business!” No more was said on the topic. Apparently satisfied, the class moved with Q&A.

It’s Somebody’s Business

What makes this exchange so troubling is that it occurred in a social-work classroom. Social workers are regularly tasked with diagnosing and treating people’s mental health issues. How can we do that effectively if we accept the dogma that all same-sex attraction is healthy and normal?

To declare that all claims to sexual orientation are above scrutiny is to analytically cripple ourselves. We’ve replaced the microscope with rose-colored glasses.

Mental health treatment requires close analysis of every aspect of a person’s life. We put together the puzzle pieces that make up a human being. We inquire how many hours someone slept last night and how often he or she woke up. We form theories around their precise level of eye contact or rate of speech. We ponder how closely they were held as infants. To declare that all claims to sexual orientation are above scrutiny is to analytically cripple ourselves. We’ve replaced the microscope with rose-colored glasses.

Let’s revisit the hypothetical Susie, but suppose she’s just straight. Say Susie likes Joe one week, then Bobby, then Pete. From a clinical perspective, this could mean a lot of things. It might just be that she’s hit the age where crushes are normal. Or she’s naturally outgoing and flirtatious. Perhaps she has low self-esteem and craves any attention she can get. It may be that she was molested, then abandoned by her father, and is seeking out sexual relationships as a way to recreate a parental bond. It could be any combination of the above factors, or none of them. But a good social worker asks why.

But now Susie likes Sarah. Do we stop asking questions all of a sudden? Shrug our shoulders and dismiss this as none of our business? This makes no sense, and it’s incompatible with the principles that drive mental health.

We live in a society where LGBT has saturated both political agenda and popular culture. Broken family structures, abuse, and relationship instability are tragically prevalent. In such a climate, reported same-sex attraction could occur for a lot of reasons. Some of them might be uncomfortable. To demand its blind, universal acceptance is both delusional and damaging to mental health. Dogmatic affirmation of all claims to sexual preference might well encourage behavior rooted in pathology.

It’s Not All Good

Another anecdote. I once worked with a two-mom, seven-child family. “The mommies,” as the kids called them, were very pleasant to work with, dedicated to the children, and willing to try pretty much anything to provide them a healthy childhood. They had family nights, chore charts, carefully-crafted systems of reward and punishment—everything a parenting book might have to offer. And their efforts had real and respectable benefits for the kids.

Parents’ ability to deal with their own issues affects their children more than their actual parenting.

But this outward functionality had cracks in its foundation. Both women had previously been in relationships with men (hence the children), and both had been badly abused. They had been abused such that they swore off men altogether and opted for a same-sex relationship. Their attraction wasn’t a case of “we were born this way,” but a reaction to brutal life experience.

And this response, while on some level sympathetic, was based on an irrational instinct that painted all men as abusive monsters. Therefore, these children were being raised in a context of pathology, of unresolved trauma. As research shows, and the field constantly emphasizes, unresolved trauma is among the greatest causes of mental illness.

And it is generational. Studies in attachment theory suggest that parents’ unhealthy attachment styles (often related to their own past abuse or trauma) are passed down to their children at a high rate, even if the children haven’t been through the same themselves, and even if the parents are doing everything child experts say is “right.” In other words, parents’ ability to deal with their own issues affects their children more than their actual parenting.

The implications for the above-mentioned family, and the growing number like them, are clear and unfortunate. The mommies (or daddies, as the case may be) might do everything “right” to give their children a healthy, stable upbringing, yet the kids are still at risk to grow up troubled and unsure how to relate to the world around them. What strikes me about this particular situation is that nobody among my colleagues acknowledged a problem. There was no questioning of the arrangement, no hint of concern. Everyone involved with the family was wholly positive about the mommies, even as they scratched their heads and wondered what was making the kids angry or depressed or confused.

Certainly, I’m not suggesting that the family should have been forcibly disrupted. But without being willing to ask how the kids might be affected, we guarantee we won’t find the answers. This was in years past, and I truly hope those children (and the mommies, for that matter) are moving toward bright futures. But I have doubts.

Blind Spots Hide Danger

I could tell more stories, but the theme should be apparent and cause for concern. Social workers and others in the ground-level helping professions should be those most attuned to human need. We should be seeing and discovering first-hand what leads to or disrupts happy and functional human lives. We should be creating a healthier society, one person at a time.

Operating off a false view of human functioning, we can be tricked into perpetuating the problems we aim to solve.

But the mental-health field is mostly professional, and thus subject to the academic and political authorities. It’s aimed at the practitioner rather than the pioneer. This leaves it unknowingly vulnerable to the powerful LGBT lobby. Even as we work to build people from the ground up, we blindly accept the ideas coming from the top down. If a professor or a textbook states that all sexual or gender orientation is above question, then so be it. The contradiction this presents to our greater body of psychological thinking goes unnoticed.

This creates a gap in otherwise perceptive, grounded, and well-intentioned minds. And this has very real consequences, for social workers are guiding the most troubled segments of society down particular paths. Operating off a false view of human functioning, we can be tricked into damaging what we’ve sworn to fix, perpetuating the problems we aim to solve. As we cruise into the twenty-first century with its fresh set of challenges, we would do well to check our blind spots once in a while.

Can Gays And Christians Coexist In America? Part 1,"Can gays and Christians co-exist in America? As the saying goes, “Can this marriage be saved?” I still hope the answer is yes. But for now, it is very much up in the air—and the answer is no longer in Christians’ hands.

This is a provocative thesis on a sensitive topic, one many of us would rather not face. I had long hoped not to return to writing at any length about this issue, especially not when conservatives are winning so many other arguments these days, and this is one that persuades few people who have not already made up their minds.

While I have written repeatedly on efforts to enact same-sex marriage through the courts, I have never lifted a finger on fights to address the issue through the democratic political process, where it belongs—in part because same-sex marriages, if recognized by legislation, are never likely to crack 1 percent of all marriages, and so will by themselves have little impact on our society. Moreover, many of my allies on the Right and personal friends are gay or are supporters of same-sex marriage, and one hates to pick at the scab of a losing political fight that divides coalitions and alienates old friends. I agonized a very long time over how to fairly present this essay, which may explain some of its length (it will run in five parts this week).

But sometimes, both truth and faith demand a defense when under assault, and I also have many friends and allies who are religious believers and despair that nobody is telling their side of the story. When my faith itself, the faith of a billion Catholics, is being cast in public debate and popular culture as a bigotry that must be stamped out by any means necessary, I feel an obligation to rise in its defense. To lay down a marker, for those who insist that faithful Christianity is “on the wrong side of history . ” To explain why we stand where we stand, and why we must. And to consider how we have come to this pass, and what might yet be done.

Today, in Part I of this five-part series, I address two of the most common, misguided efforts to dismiss the Christian view of marriage and the Christian approach to homosexuality as some sort of invidious pretext: the fallacious claim that Christian teaching rests solely on the Old Testament Mosaic law, and the argument that if homosexual orientation is inborn, this somehow disproves Christian teachings.

Part II will discuss the persistent effort to delegitimize Christian doctrines on marriage by comparing them to Jim Crow and slavery. Part III will deal with the Christian concept of scandal and the differences between liberty-based and equality-based views of homosexuality. Part IV will return to the legal debate over whether a rational person could find any basis to distinguish opposite-sex from same-sex marriage, and explain quite how far one has to bend reality in order to conclude that none exists. Part V will examine the prospects for a Westphalian peace on these issues.

The High Stakes of the Marriage Debate

Many myths about the Christian view of marriage and the Christian view of homosexuality have become so pervasive that we hardly even notice them, yet it is considered rude or worse to counter (people who will not stop talking about the subject suddenly ask, “Why should you care?” when you respond). As a result, without a vigorous defense, believing Christians in this country face a genuine existential threat: that our culture and legal systems will declare the adherence to core Christian doctrines—unchanged for millennia, directly derived from the words of Jesus and the letters of St. Paul, and in the heartland of the legitimacy of Christ’s teachings—to be outside the bounds of civilized society in the way that the Klu Klux Klan is today.

Believing Christians in this country face a genuine existential threat.

Should faithful followers of the nation’s largest religious denomination, the world’s oldest and largest church, be run out of public life? Should those of us who still believe in the words of Jesus of Nazareth be afraid or ashamed to say so in public?

Make no mistake: these are the stakes, and trying to quietly keep our heads down and stay out of trouble will not long put off the day of reckoning. They are embedded in the legal argument that there is no possible rational basis for ever finding that any distinction at all exists or ever could exist between traditional opposite-sex marriage and same-sex marriage.

A series of judicial decisions have held that nobody who takes the traditional side of this argument could possibly be rational, reasonable, or motivated by anything but bigotry, and the Supreme Court may be on the cusp within the next few weeks of doing the same. The stakes are embedded in the language of debate itself, in which any response to arguments about the equivalence of same-sex relationships to traditional marriage is deemed “homophobia”—literally, a diagnosis that any person professing traditional Christian teachings (or traditional teachings of Judaism or Islam, for that matter) suffers from a phobia, a form of mental illness (a mental defect roughly half of all Americans still share ).

These are not the terms of debate used against reasonable people who can disagree in good faith; they are the terms of delegitimization, designed to brand the opposing argument as unfit to be heard in civil society, and its proponents as people deserving of being driven from full participation in that society.

Lest you consider this to be hyperbole, consider the array of public controversies the past few years that have organized pressure campaigns to treat opponents of same-sex marriage and adherents to traditional Christianity as pariahs:

This is aside from the small, petty battles like refusing to do business with people who oppose same-sex marriage.

Some of these are legal or political questions, and the law has frequently ridden ahead of culture and voters. But all signify a shift in social and cultural sentiment, starting among our social elites—lawyers, academics, entertainers, social scientists—that filters down to young people eager to accept what these authority figures tell them. So, while my prior writing on same-sex marriage has focused on the legal issues and the strictly secular rational basis for drawing a distinction between traditional opposite-sex marriage and same-sex marriage, it is the social, cultural, and religious argument that is central and preliminary to all the others, and that is where I will begin before circling back to law and politics in the second half of this essay.

Any response to arguments about the equivalence of same-sex relationships to traditional marriage is deemed ‘homophobia.’

For conciseness, some generalizations are unavoidable. As a Catholic, I discuss Christianity primarily from the Catholic perspective, but many of the issues facing Catholics are common to other theologically faithful, orthodox Christians, including evangelical Protestants, members of the Greek Orthodox and Russian Orthodox Christian churches, and Mormons, Orthodox Jews and Muslims. Where I discuss the contrary “LGBT” perspective, I am necessarily generalizing about a set of ideas and ideology that is pervasive in political and legal writing on this topic. But by no means do all gay Americans—who are not a monolithic political bloc—adopt the full ideology of the most vocal LGBT activists.

Christians can and should attempt to defuse some of these controversies at the margins, as I suggest in Part V, and are paying the price now for having failed to do so in the past. And the Republican Party, for reasons of its own rational self-interest, must find some way to reach a modus vivendi or détente on these questions, as political parties in our system always do when an issue in the public square turns against them.

But, ultimately, whether peaceful coexistence is possible is not ours to decide. We can only wait and see whether the proponents of same-sex marriage—flush with political power, brimming with unquestioning and judgmental certainty, and in some cases seething with long-nursed grievances—are willing or able to find any stopping point that does not force believing Christians into a choice between renouncing the central truth claims of their faith or being driven from decent society as if they were Klansmen. It is more likely that this will happen if we lack the courage to explain and defend our own beliefs. If we act as if those beliefs are an embarrassment, we only abet their suppression.

Marriage Is Central to Christianity

Let there be no doubt: the teachings (1) defining marriage as between one man and one woman, and (2) against homosexual sex, are so deeply rooted in Christianity that, to tear them out, you would need to destroy the foundations of the Catholic Church and nearly all Protestant and Orthodox churches, and compel them to deny the central claims for the truth and legitimacy of any of their teachings (undoubtedly, for some critics, this is a feature rather than a bug of this whole controversy). If this is a battle to eliminate those two teachings, it can only end with the extermination of Christianity in America. This is not exaggeration, but rather a clear-eyed understanding of the New Testament and the nature of the Church.

There are three primary lines of argument against these two core Christian teachings. All three of them proceed, not from any Christian premise about the truth or falsity of theology, but rather from the view that what the Church teaches cannot be true because of its perceived civil implications. These arguments all—there is no polite way to put this—involve significant amounts of willful ignorance and bad faith; they are unsustainable as theology, and in fact are deeply anti-theology.

God, Man, and Shrimp

The first line of argument made against the Catholic position is what you might call the “God hates shrimp” argument: that Jesus doesn’t say anything about homosexuality, and it is simply a part of the detailed rulebook of Leviticus and Deuteronomy that also has all sorts of rules Christians no longer follow, like the rule against eating shellfish. If you eat shrimp, the argument goes, you must not actually believe in the Bible.

If this is a battle to eliminate those two teachings, it can only end with the extermination of Christianity in America.

Now, first, this is no argument against Orthodox Jews, who actually do still follow the Mosaic Law. Jews may be accustomed to having their religion mocked and maligned, but that does not make it right. From a rigorous Jewish perspective, the rules given to Moses remain in effect just as on the day Moses came down from Mount Sinai. And Leviticus 18:22 & 20:13 are quite explicit in denouncing homosexual sex.

Second, as a matter of Scripture, the “God hates shrimp” meme is factually untrue, and reveals that the people making this argument have no clue what they are talking about. On the one hand, the Old and New Testament’s rules are not of equal weight to Christians, because Christians believe that Jesus fulfilled or superseded (one can have lengthy theological arguments over the precise wording) the old covenant, including the old Mosaic law, and commanded us to follow His teachings.

While that new covenant does not discredit the moral value of the Old Testament laws, it does suggest a reorientation that prioritizes moral teachings over things like dietary rules and rituals that Jesus rather conspicuously broke from in order to illustrate the small-mindedness of rule-obsessed Pharisees. As the Catechism, the Catholic Church’s formal statement of doctrine, explains:

The Old Law is the first stage of revealed Law. Its moral prescriptions are summed up in the Ten Commandments…According to Christian tradition, the Law is holy, spiritual, and good, yet still imperfect. Like a tutor it shows what must be done…However, the Law remains the first stage on the way to the kingdom. It prepares and disposes the chosen people and each Christian for conversion and faith in the Savior God. It provides a teaching which endures for ever, like the Word of God. The Old Law is a preparation for the Gospel….The Law of the Gospel “fulfills,” refines, surpasses, and leads the Old Law to its perfection….The Lord’s Sermon on the Mount, far from abolishing or devaluing the moral prescriptions of the Old Law, releases their hidden potential and has new demands arise from them: it reveals their entire divine and human truth.

If you’re curious, less formal explanations of why Christians do not follow all the Old Testament’s rules, from a variety of Christian sectarian perspectives, can be found here, here, here, and here (these are just Internet samples; on any topic of theology, the best stuff is in books and runs much deeper).

Part of that explanation, which I’ll return to below, is that the Old Law was a set of organizing rules for society under essentially theocratic rule (thus, the Old Law contains penalties—including death!—for various offenses), whereas the New Testament is much less interested in the ordering of society and instead instructs us first and foremost to order our own lives with a view to the next life:

In the Old Testament things like adultery or incest were punishable with civil sanctions like execution. This is because at that time God’s people existed in the form of a nation-state and so all sins had civil penalties. But in the New Testament the people of God are an assembly of churches all over the world, living under many different governments. The church is not a civil government, and so sins are dealt with by exhortation and, at worst, exclusion from membership….Why this change? Under Christ, the gospel is not confined to a single nation—it has been released to go into all cultures and peoples. Once you grant the main premise of the Bible—about the surpassing significance of Christ and his salvation—then all the various parts of the Bible make sense. Because of Christ, the ceremonial law is repealed. Because of Christ the church is no longer a nation-state imposing civil penalties.

The second reason why the “God hates shrimp” shtick is factually incorrect is that the New Testament does, repeatedly, express both the condemnation of homosexual sex and the definition of marriage as exclusively between a man and a woman. The opening chapter of Paul’s letter to the Romans is the most explicit on the former:

The wrath of God is indeed being revealed from heaven against every impiety and wickedness of those who suppress the truth by their wickedness….they have no excuse; for although they knew God they did not accord him glory as God or give him thanks. Instead, they became vain in their reasoning, and their senseless minds were darkened. While claiming to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for the likeness of an image of mortal man…Therefore, God handed them over to degrading passions. Their females exchanged natural relations for unnatural, and the males likewise gave up natural relations with females and burned with lust for one another. Males did shameful things with males and thus received in their own persons the due penalty for their perversity.

Paul returns to this theme again in 1 Corinthians 6:9-20 and 1 Timothy 1:8-11, and while there are a variety of English translations of these and other passages, any serious understanding of them will find Paul (or whoever wrote 1 Timothy) denouncing homosexual sodomy, as the terminology taken from the original Greek includes one word that “was commonly used to refer to young men who were homosexual prostitutes” and another that “literally means A man who has sexual intercourse with a man (arsenokoites). This was the commonly used Greek term to mean a homosexual. You really cannot get any more explicit than this.”

The talking-point that “well, Jesus never said that” should be recognized for what it is: a direct challenge to the authority of Paul and other early church fathers to speak with the authority of divine inspiration, and indeed a challenge to the inclusion of the epistles in the Bible at all. You do not need a lot of familiarity with Christian doctrine to recognize what a truly radical and literally heretical position this is.

‘Their females exchanged natural relations for unnatural, and the males likewise gave up natural relations with females and burned with lust for one another.’

From the Catholic perspective, the idea that only the Gospels can teach Christians is, literally, a renunciation of the Church itself—2,000 years of scholarship and ministry have been predicated upon the idea that the Church takes its authority from Jesus’ “Great Commission” to the apostles, and specifically his grant to Peter of “the authority to absolve sins, to pronounce doctrinal judgements, and to make disciplinary decisions in the Church.” From a Protestant perspective, Martin Luther’s theological basis for breaking with the Catholic Church derives from his reading of the first chapter of Romans—the very chapter that the “God hates shrimp” crowd would read out of the New Testament. You simply cannot tear up and discard Paul’s letters and find anything left standing of Catholic or Protestant theology.

As to marriage, Jesus weighed in quite directly and explicitly on the matter, most directly in the fifth and nineteenth chapters of Matthew’s Gospel. In the Sermon on the Mount, at Matthew 5:27-32, Jesus explains that his law is stricter than the Old Law in matters of marriage, divorce and adultery:

You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ But I say to you, everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart…It was also said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife must give her a bill of divorce.’ But I say to you, whoever divorces his wife (unless the marriage is unlawful) causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.

He elaborates on this teaching at, among other places, Matthew 19:3-12:

Some Pharisees approached him, and tested him, saying, ‘Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause whatever?’ He said in reply, ‘Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator “made them male and female” and said, “For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh”? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, no human being must separate.’ They said to him, ‘Then why did Moses command that the man give the woman a bill of divorce and dismiss [her]?’ He said to them, ‘Because of the hardness of your hearts Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. I say to you, whoever divorces his wife (unless the marriage is unlawful) and marries another commits adultery.’ [His] disciples said to him, ‘If that is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.’ He answered, ‘Not all can accept [this] word, but only those to whom that is granted. Some are incapable of marriage because they were born so; some, because they were made so by others; some, because they have renounced marriage for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept this ought to accept it.’ (emphasis added)

Mostly the same passage appears in Mark 10:2-12. Jesus’ definition of marriage as proceeding from our creation as male and female was no oversight. Contrary to what modern readers unfamiliar with history might think, neither homosexual sex nor polygamy nor divorce were unknown in the ancient world. Quite the contrary. Same-sex relations were quite common in ancient Greece and Rome, and it is no accident that the topic came up repeatedly when Paul was writing to Greeks and Romans.

You simply cannot tear up and discard Paul’s letters and find anything left standing of Catholic or Protestant theology.

Polygamy appears often in the Old Testament, and was still common in many places at the time of Jesus. Divorce, as the Pharisees noted, had even been expressly permitted in the Old Law. Jesus, speaking to his own times, often had to explain things in terms that would be understood by the people of the day, but being divine and speaking for the ages, there is no reason to think that it was accident or error that he placed the complementary creation of male and female at the center of his explanation of the divine origin of marriage.

It is, in any possible good-faith reading of the gospel, only a man and a woman of which Jesus speaks when he says, “what God has joined together, no human being must separate.” In a single stroke, his definition excludes same-sex marriage, polygamy, and divorce. While that definition may seem radical in today’s America for reasons different from why it seemed radical then, it cannot possibly be written off as merely an artifact of its times without denying the divinity of its author. If this is the wrong way to describe marriage, then God is wrong and, with him, all of Christianity.

The Hard Road

The second popular argument against the biblical Christian teaching on marriage and homosexual sex is what you might call the “born this way” argument. Put simply, this argument says that homosexual orientation is inborn, inherent, or otherwise not a matter of personal choice, and therefore acting in accordance with that orientation cannot be immoral, because it can’t possibly be immoral to be who you are. There is a surface emotional appeal to this, but it does not withstand even mild scrutiny.

It is fairly clear that, at least for most gay men, homosexual orientation is something that is basically fixed and immune to outside influence by the late teen years.

First, a brief digression. As a scientific matter, we don’t actually know the origins of homosexual orientation—no “gay gene,” for example, has thus far been identified—nor do we know the equally important question (for scientific purposes) of whether homosexual orientation has the same origin in all people. Popular writing on the topic tends to just assume this latter point. For example, it may well be the case that gay men and lesbians come by their orientation in different ways, or at least we should not automatically assume they are identical in the absence of evidence.

Similarly, even within a single gender, the question of single versus multiple causes is an empirical one worthy of study to better our understanding. Without direct knowledge of causation, we can also not know for certain whether it is possible in any case for a man to change his sexual orientation in adulthood. One hopes—although recent history is not encouraging—that all these questions can be examined dispassionately by scientists dedicated solely to enhancing our knowledge, without regard to political agendas.

Absent direct causal evidence, we can only rely on circumstantial evidence. This is not to denigrate the strength of scientific conclusions that can derive from circumstantial evidence. For example, we do not know how smoking causes lung cancer, but the epidemiological evidence of correlation between smoking and lung cancer is so overwhelming that causation can be reliably inferred.

Without delving too far into the science, there are a number of theories about the origins of homosexual orientation—genetic, biochemical in the womb, environmental in childhood—and an ongoing debate over the extent to which they mesh with the available circumstantial evidence. But it is nonetheless fairly clear that, at least for most gay men, homosexual orientation is something that is basically fixed and immune to outside influence by the late teen years. The desire, by that point, is not a matter of choice: the heart wants what it wants, and the body wants what it wants.

This is a compelling argument for treating gays and lesbians with respect and human decency, and accommodating oneself to the reality that gays are not going anywhere and cannot simply be talked out of their heartfelt desires.

At the same time, it ignores reality to argue that no one has a choice between same-sex and opposite-sex relationships. The most recent survey data from the Centers for Disease Control, for example, shows that 2.5 percent of the adult population self-identifies as either gay or bisexual: 1.6 percent gay, 0.7 percent bisexual. As an overall percentage, it is possible that these poll numbers are skewed by some form of underreporting, although it’s the best data we have at present.

In any event, the proportion between the two groups is telling. Nearly a third of the people who self-identify as either gay or bisexual consider themselves bisexual. Whether or not you believe that people are born bisexual, it is ridiculous to suggest that bisexuality offers no choice. If you’re going to accept the monogamy inherent in marriage, you must suppress your attraction either towards the opposite sex or towards your own sex.

It should be sufficient to agree on these two basic points (i.e. that there are both effectively immutable characteristics and behavioral choices at issue) without wading into the swamps of related arguments over “gender identity” or whether children can be said to have a sexual orientation. Regardless of who does have choices, the unyielding reality is that homosexual orientation—in and of itself—is not a matter of choice for a significant number of people.

This is a compelling argument for treating gays and lesbians with respect and human decency, and accommodating oneself to the reality that gays are not going anywhere and cannot simply be talked out of their heartfelt desires. Indeed, the Catechism of the Catholic Church explicitly recognizes this: “The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination…constitutes for most of them a trial. They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided.”

It is also a compelling case, politically, against efforts to criminalize consensual homosexual sex. And it is an argument, within Christian churches, for more understanding of the unique burden carried by homosexual Christians in seeking to be faithful to Christ’s teachings. But none of this is, in any meaningful sense, a theological argument; to derive a principle that endorses homosexual sex from the fact that some people have an inherent and possibly inborn desire for it is the classic appeal-to-nature fallacy that assumes that whatever is natural must be moral.

The foundations of Judeo-Christian morality from the Garden of Eden forward are built on the idea that our natural desires lead us to sin, for which salvation from outside nature is required.

This is irreconcilable with Christian ethics. The foundations of Judeo-Christian morality from the Garden of Eden forward are built on the idea that our natural desires lead us to sin, for which salvation from outside nature is required. In fact, more broadly, the entire project of human morals and ethics assumes that what separates us from animals is our ability to say “no” to our instinctive desires.

The Gospels, and the rest of the New Testament, are shot through with repeated exhortations to not simply give in to the desires of the flesh and to accept that the teachings of Christ would be demanding to follow. Over and over, both Jesus and Paul tell us this, most memorably in this passage from Mark’s gospel:

If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed than with two hands to go into Gehenna, into the unquenchable fire. And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life crippled than with two feet to be thrown into Gehenna. And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. Better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into Gehenna, where ‘their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.’ (Mark 9:43-48)

These are demanding teachings for all Christians, gay or straight—even more demanding when combined with Jesus’ teaching in Matthew 5:27-32 (quoted above) about lust. The Catechism itself stresses, “Self-mastery is a long and exacting work. One can never consider it acquired once and for all. It presupposes renewed effort at all stages of life.” Jesus explicitly applied these teachings in this context. In the crucial passage on marriage, he concludes:

Not all can accept [this] word, but only those to whom that is granted. Some are incapable of marriage because they were born so; some, because they were made so by others; some, because they have renounced marriage for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept this ought to accept it. (Matthew 19:11-12, emphasis added)

In short, to summarize in a nutshell a debate that spans nearly the whole of the Judeo-Christian and Western philosophical traditions, the fact that an individual moral teaching may be difficult to follow can be an argument for leniency and exception in its application, but it has never been an argument for deeming a moral teaching to be invalid, especially—in the Christian context—one that comes to us directly from the words of Jesus or the epistles of Paul. Such a line of reasoning, if followed, would eviscerate the entire concept of Christian moral teaching and replace it with something more like a book of manners.

Broadly speaking, Christians are instructed that sex must be confined to marriage, a longstanding and carefully reasoned interpretation of the Sixth Commandment (against adultery) that hundreds of generations of scholars have reaffirmed and that was reinforced, not superseded, in the gospels and the New Testament. These, too, are hard teachings to follow, and in the real world Christians often fail at them. We should not be surprised that gay Christians fail at them, too, but that should not stop us from calling it failure rather than trying to conform the definition of sin to “only things I never do.”

These are hard teachings to follow, and in the real world Christians often fail at them. That should not stop us from calling it failure rather than trying to conform the definition of sin to ‘only things I never do.’

In explaining why not everything that is inborn is therefore morally acceptable, defenders of conservative moral teaching tend, as moral teachers often have, to resort to argument by analogy. Analogies are drawn to other human tendencies that may be said, more or less, to be inherent, genetic, or otherwise wired into us, ranging from a predisposition to alcoholism, to other forms of sexual preferences, to the rather obviously extreme example of pedophilia. (One could just as easily analogize to positive traits or tendencies that we are born or grow up with, except nobody has moral proscriptions against those, so it’s hard to make a workable analogy out of them).

That brings us to one of the challenges of having a rational debate on these topics, because the response to any argument by analogy is not reasoned rebuttal but, almost invariably, the throwing of an apoplectic fit at the comparison. But the core question of every moral argument remains, whether it upsets you to ask it or not: does, or can, Christianity reasonably ask human beings to meet a higher standard of conduct than simply doing what we desire or are naturally inclined to do? The pedophile example, like analogies to Hitler in philosophical debates about war and politics, is designed to test the limits of this line of reasoning precisely because it is so extreme that almost nobody defends acting on pedophilic tendencies.

As will be discussed in Part III below, the issue of treating sexual orientation as an identity, and denying any distinction between identity and behavior, is a recurring theme in the divide between the LGBT and Christian worldviews. But as a matter of Christian theology, while biology certainly informs our understanding of the world, it does not eliminate the idea of moral limits on human behavior. To be a Christian is to recognize that human beings are called to be more than the sum of our biological impulses. To demand that those impulses be given the central place in our identity is to deem Christianity a dead letter, and set in place the human body itself as our idol.

PART II TOMORROW: Why the Christian view of marriage and sexuality is not at all like the arguments offered in defense of slavery or Jim Crow.

Can Gays And Christians Coexist In America? Part III,"In parts I and II, I focused on the substance of Christian teachings about marriage and homosexual sex. In this part, I discuss the reasons of theology, politics, and legal strategy that bring Christian sacraments and morals into direct collision with the LGBT-rights movement.

As discussed in parts I and II, the arguments for excusing Christians from following Jesus’ and Paul’s teachings on marriage and on homosexual sex are grounded in unsettled science, bad history, and worse theology. The more serious argument among people who are more versed in Christianity is not what is right or wrong as a matter of scripture or doctrine but that Christians need less judging and more mercy and humanity towards gay people. We are told to follow the example of Jesus’ injunction that he who is without sin should cast the first stone.

As a general rule for living the Gospels, this is indeed worthy advice, and conservative Christians have too often failed to heed it in dealing with gay men and lesbians. A spirit of toleration and Christian charity goes a long way to encouraging others to follow the Golden Rule, and even if they don’t, it remains our duty as Christians. “Hate the sin, love the sinner” is technically correct theology, but as a practical creed, it’s got the order backwards.

But there is a critical distinction between sin and what the Catholic Church calls scandal. It is a distinction that, again, comes directly from the Gospels, straight from the mouth of Jesus Christ. Without it, you can understand neither the traditional Christian dichotomy between the sinner and the sin nor the reason why same-sex marriage and other LGBT-rights controversies create direct threats to Christian conscience. Christians who are otherwise inclined to “live and let live” are increasingly faced with demands that they provide positive celebration and endorsement for sin. That violates the duty to avoid scandal.

Sin and Scandal in the Gospels

To sin, to break God’s moral commands, is human. It is central to all Christian thinking, to the very purpose of the incarnation and the crucifixion, to recognize that every one of us is a sinner. No Christian can refuse to associate with sinners. Jesus made a point of doing so, and when the Pharisees questioned him for hanging out with prostitutes and tax collectors, he responded (at Mark 2:17): “Those who are well do not need a physician, but the sick do. I did not come to call the righteous but sinners.”

His mercy separates her from her sin, rather than encouraging her to embrace it.

In a similar vein, his injunction when forgiving the adulterous woman, “[l]et the one among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her,” was deliberately aimed at reminding the crowd that they were all sinners as much in need of his forgiveness as she was (John 8:3-11). Just as crucially, that story also ends with Jesus telling the woman to go and not commit this sin again. He pointedly gives her forgiveness and mercy, but not justification for her actions. His mercy separates her from her sin, rather than encouraging her to embrace it.

Scandal evokes the opposite reaction. Jesus says, at Matthew 18:6-7: “Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea. Woe to the world because of things that cause sin! Such things must come, but woe to the one through whom they come!” (see also Luke 17:1).

As the Catholic Catechism puts it, elaborating on these passages from Matthew and Luke:

Scandal is an attitude or behavior which leads another to do evil. The person who gives scandal becomes his neighbor’s tempter. He damages virtue and integrity; he may even draw his brother into spiritual death. Scandal is a grave offense if by deed or omission another is deliberately led into a grave offense.



Scandal takes on a particular gravity by reason of the authority of those who cause it or the weakness of those who are scandalized….Scandal is grave when given by those who by nature or office are obliged to teach and educate others. Jesus reproaches the scribes and Pharisees on this account: he likens them to wolves in sheep’s clothing.



Scandal can be provoked by laws or institutions, by fashion or opinion. Therefore, they are guilty of scandal who establish laws or social structures leading to the decline of morals and the corruption of religious practice, or to “social conditions that, intentionally or not, make Christian conduct and obedience to the Commandments difficult and practically impossible.” This is also true of business leaders who make rules encouraging fraud, teachers who provoke their children to anger, or manipulators of public opinion who turn it away from moral values.



Anyone who uses the power at his disposal in such a way that it leads others to do wrong becomes guilty of scandal and responsible for the evil that he has directly or indirectly encouraged. (emphasis added)

Christ calls us to mercy towards sinners, in recognition that we are all sinners. But it is not hypocritical for sinners to profess virtue and denounce sin; it is precisely what the Gospel demands of us, sinners though we are. What Jesus denounces as hypocritical and cowardly is the opposite—pridefully refusing to admit sin and portraying sin as virtue, which causes others to be led astray when they emulate its example. That is implicit in Luke 18:9-14, where Jesus notes that the tax collector who beats his breast in remorse and begs God’s mercy goes home justified, while the Pharisee who proclaims his own virtue does not.

Sin’s Not the Problem—Celebrating It Is

Likewise, we all are called to confession and repentance. Every sin, no matter how bad, can be forgiven, even those sins that we know (through our weakness) we will commit again. Except one: the refusal to admit sin and repent, the insistence that a sin is not a sin. God will not forgive us when we do not admit we were wrong. And to hold up sin in public as if it were virtue is scandal, called such because the church sees it not only as a personal sin but as leading others to sin.

This is the doctrine at the core of Christian resistance to any sort of public celebration of same-sex relationships. The problem is not that homosexuals are sinning, for all of us sin, and all of us have family and friends who sin, and all of us sit in pews listening to priests who sin. The problem is not associating with sinners, which is not just permitted but commanded to Christians. The problem is celebrating sin as if it were virtue.

The problem is not associating with sinners, which is not just permitted but commanded to Christians. The problem is celebrating sin as if it were virtue.

To Christians who accept the New Testament’s teachings—to Catholics who accept the Catechism—this is why things like “Gay Pride” events, or gay groups marching (as gay groups, rather than as individuals) in the St. Patrick’s Day Parade, or taking part in an expressive way (such as a wedding photographer) in a same-sex wedding is wrong: it crosses the line from tolerance and mercy towards our fellow sinners to the perpetuation of the idea that a sin is not sin, but a thing to be celebrated. It crosses from forgiveness of sin, which Jesus’ example commands us to offer, to justification of sin, which he condemns in the strongest language he uses anywhere in the Gospels. (As Erick Erickson puts it, of course Jesus would bake a cake for gay people—but not for a gay wedding).

You have the right in a free society to call your relationship whatever you want, but when you demand that I call it what you want, that is the point where your rights end, and mine begin. A Christian who surrenders to government or social pressure to celebrate sin has committed the grave sin of scandal. This Christians cannot do and still call themselves Christians.

This is the very point on which Thomas More, the patron saint of my profession, resisted to death. More went to some lengths to avoid confrontation and stay silent as King Henry VIII rewrote the Christian rules of marriage to suit his own needs and shattered the Church in England in the process. But when he was asked to swear an oath to a remarriage he could not in conscience support, he felt he had no choice but to refuse, even knowing it might lead (as it did) to his death. More’s conscience could abide the king’s sin, but not his own scandal.

Sex and Identity

This brings us to why this is such an explosive confrontation, and one that both sides view as an existential struggle. If you go back to the 1960s and 1970s, the primary fronts in the culture war involved heterosexual relationships and heterosexual sex. There were battles over divorce, premarital sex, contraception, open or “swinging” relationships, pornography, abortion, single parenthood, etc. These were often ferocious arguments, and many of them are still being litigated culturally, politically, legally, and religiously to this day.

The heterosexual culture warriors, little though they might like to admit it, accepted at a fundamental level that they were arguing about conduct.

As bitter as those culture-war battles could be, however, there was generally a shared implicit understanding that if the Christians lost, they could be left to themselves. Coexistence was possible. The reason for this was that the heterosexual culture warriors, little though they might like to admit it, accepted at a fundamental level that they were arguing about conduct. You might not like it that your Christian neighbor viewed your live-in girlfriend as a sinful relationship, but you accepted that this was something you had freely chosen to do, and if somebody else’s moral code was violated, hey man, that wasn’t your problem because you didn’t agree anyway. You were disagreeing over how you chose to live your life.

The same-sex marriage fight is different because it has been framed, not as a battle over conduct, but as a battle over identity, as to which differences of opinion are impossible. The ideology behind the same-sex marriage movement and other “LGBT issues” as they are commonly presented derives from the premises that 1) sexual orientation is integral to personal identity, 2) sexual relationships are inseparable from sexual orientation, and 3) any criticism of homosexual relationships is therefore a criticism of the person’s identity itself—an expression of bigotry equivalent in all material respects to racism because it casts moral disapproval on an immutable characteristic.

But, as noted in Part I, this is not at all how Christians view these questions. Christians, following scripture, view heterosexual marriage and heterosexual sex as behaviors subject to moral principles. To the Christian mind, the idea that homosexual sex and homosexual relationships are exempt from these same moral principles on grounds of being an “identity” is illogical, asymmetrical, and, in a theological sense, scandalous.

At the same time, Christians do view our status as Christ-followers, created in the image and likeness of God, as central to our own identities, in a way that transcends and ultimately outlasts not only such artificial earthly categories as race but even earthly realities like our physical bodies and their sexes. To Christians, even not-so-devout Christians, the very purpose of life on earth is the individual’s relationship with God, and all other things are either means to that end or obstacles to it. To a Christian, a believing Christian, faith is not just something you believe or do—it is why you exist.

Why Gay Ideology Leads to Christian Extermination

Christians can and do, of course, deal with many issues (science, law, history, sports) that require lines of reasoning that have no faith component. To reason outside the domains and doctrines of faith, though, is one thing; to declare them invalid or irrational is to deny the central facet of our existence and identity. To treat a legitimate Christian teaching as bigotry that must be stamped out, rather than merely subjected to external disagreement (as other faiths do) is, ultimately, to treat the Christians themselves as people whose identity must be stamped out by society.

Certainly there are those, like New York Times columnist Josh Barro, who argue openly for such an approach to Christians:

Energy behind SB1062 isn't so much about rights as norms– socons desperate to retain idea that reasonable ppl can disagree on gay marriage



— Josh Barro (@jbarro) February 25, 2014

It's weird how views held for no reason — i.e. ""faith"" — get extra deference instead of reduced deference.



— Josh Barro (@jbarro) February 24, 2014



The common LGBT activist view that sexual relationships are inseparable from individual identity is not going away, and Christians—while we may find that worldview wrong and illogical—must find a way to coexist with it. But coexistence is possible only if the distinct Christian view of identity is also treated as legitimate. If it is not, then the continued presence of Christians in society cannot and eventually will not be tolerated.

We do not demand as a price that they give up their sexual relationships, and they should not expect to demand as a price that we give up our faith or our principles.

For Christians, coexistence may sometimes take work, but it ought not to be difficult. For people coming of age after the Sexual Revolution and trying to stay faithful to Christ’s teachings, it is commonplace to encounter unmarried heterosexual peers in one’s teens and early twenties who are sexually active. It quickly becomes apparent, even if spending your time around mostly churchgoing Christians, that a great many of your friends will be people who have no problem with unmarried sex, and engage in it without much visible guilt. Can you coexist with unmarried people having sex? Of course you can, and you’ll have a lot fewer friends if you can’t.

Most modern young people face this reality. Some fall victim to scandal—being surrounded by the practice, they lose the ability to judge it wrong. Those who do maintain their principles learn to balance that with coexistence, not grudgingly but joyfully. The same principle extends to how Christians coexist with Jews, atheists, and Christians of other denominations. We can disagree about big, important, fundamental things; I don’t much care who thinks I am going to Hell, as long as they don’t consider it their job to send me there.

Likewise, it is no contradiction for a Christian to take the same approach to gay friends, gay co-workers, gay political allies, gay fellow congregants. We do not demand as a price that they give up their sexual relationships, and they should not expect to demand as a price that we give up our faith or our principles. It would be a poorer and a meaner America if we cannot learn to make that spirit run both ways.

The Relationship Between Liberty and Equality

So there is a cultural collision, one that cannot be resolved simply by asking Christians to stop believing what Jesus, the New Testament, and the church have told us. How did it become a pitched political and legal battle? It happened because the LGBT cause, in consequence of the worldview that sees all LGBT issues as questions of identity rather than free choice, was framed as a fight over equality rather than liberty. Further, it happened because the movement has been carried forward via the liberal progressive view of equality as a positive condition for government and the courts to promote, even if that means denying or destroying actual differences that exist in the real world.

In the American tradition, both liberty and equality are important values. Going back to the early American spirit de Tocqueville observed, they have often been in harmony: Americans see universal liberty as a means of expressing social and political equality, and of creating the conditions for economic equality of opportunity. But modern culture-war flashpoints often bring these two values into conflict because progressives see liberty as an obstacle to equality (or at least, as inadequate to provide it), while conservatives tend to place a higher value on liberty, on the theory that liberty produces as much equality of opportunity as we are likely to get without destroying opportunity.

Gay Activists Choose Confrontation

Early LGBT-rights arguments from the 1960s to the 1980s were often framed in terms of liberty, most prominently the fight against sodomy laws and the obvious injustice, highlighted in the years of the AIDS crisis, of gay couples being denied hospital visitation rights enjoyed even by unmarried opposite-sex domestic partners. Some social conservative hardliners, of course, were unsympathetic even to these arguments, but for many of us, there was a strong case for recognizing gay liberty to form intimate associations and for passing laws to create space for those liberties.

From the very outset of the same-sex marriage debate, LGBT activists chose a winner-take-all battle for control of the law.

This is why I and more than a few other social conservatives came (in my case, two decades ago) to favor legislative passage of civil unions that could be tailored to protect liberty. Unfortunately, there was never much of a constituency to make that a reality, especially once the courts seized control of the issue.

In order to argue for liberty for gay relationships, one need only adopt the modest principle that consenting adults ought in most cases to be able to do what they want, so long as they’re not harming anyone else. This principle had already proven repeatedly to be popular in the previous decades of culture-war arguments, and it preserves an escape hatch: Christians could agree with the general liberty principle without being compelled to agree to the scandalous proposition that same-sex relationships are actually the same thing as the sacrament of marriage.

Was there any point at which a genuine political opportunity existed to build a coalition to support a pro-liberty gay-rights policy? Maybe there was, and maybe there wasn’t. But from the very outset of the same-sex marriage debate, LGBT activists chose to pursue a maximalist litigation strategy deliberately modeled on the civil rights movement’s drive to destroy Jim Crow. This strategy by its nature de-emphasized liberty and mutual tolerance in favor of a winner-take-all battle for control of the law.

Adoption of this model necessarily required suppressing any distinction between identity and behavior: while a pro-liberty argument creates space for differences in behavior, a pro-equality argument requires that the discussion focus solely on immutable characteristics. The “Jim Crow” strategy focused on litigation far more than persuasion, with activists using equal-protection arguments to gain judicial recognition of same-sex marriages beginning in Hawaii and Vermont in the 1990s, while shunning approaches to legislatures, bitterly opposing any effort to have the issue settled by popular referenda, and seeking to have any contrary legislation or referenda nullified by the courts.

The result has been an angry stalemate that waits almost entirely on the decision of one 78-year-old judge, Anthony Kennedy.

Given the political terrain from the early 1990s through the mid-2000s, this was a coldly rational calculation, but also a risky one. Rational, because public opinion at large strongly opposed recognizing same-sex marriages, while the legal profession and thus the courts was mostly in favor, so the best results were likely to come from appealing to lawyers while freezing out voters. Risky, because voter backlashes against the legal system tend to be a blunt instrument on those rare occasions when the sleeping giant of the electorate is aroused, and an inherently confrontational litigation strategy could provoke that.

Unsurprisingly, the “marriage equality” movement initially did produce a backlash that made political compromise all but impossible, and thus ran (for some years) a risk of derailing the movement by enshrining amendments in state constitutions, and possibly the national Constitution, that could have precluded political recognition of even civil unions. Popular referenda almost uniformly favored traditional marriage as late as 2008 (when both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton campaigned as opponents of same-sex marriage—the former not reversing course until 2012, the latter in 2013). Even in 2012, opposition to same-sex marriage fared better at the polls in deep-blue states than the comparatively moderate national Republican ticket.

The tide by now has turned, of course, due in part to cultural and generational shifts. But even today, LGBT political activists strenuously oppose having the question settled by the voters or in a legislative compromise of any kind rather than in a winner-take-all court battle, belying their confident assertions of overwhelming popular support. Christian conservatives, by contrast, have developed something of a siege mentality, recognizing that any offer of compromise will be regarded as a sign of weakness and a signal to demand unconditional surrender.

The result has been an angry stalemate that waits almost entirely on the decision of one 78-year-old judge, Anthony Kennedy. In Part IV, I will explore why the effort at a judicial resolution of this issue is so wrongheaded, and in Part V, why there ought to be a better way, and what remains of the avenues to get there.

Can Gays And Christians Coexist In America? Part IV,"In parts I and II, I looked at Christian teachings on marriage and homosexual sex. In part III, I examined why the decision to resolve the same-sex marriage debate by litigation over “marriage equality” rather than by political debates over individual liberty has generated so much conflict between Christians and gay activists.

In this part, I look specifically at how the legal arguments over same-sex marriage require the law to devalue marriage, ignore reality, and insult Christians and other religious believers.

The decision to seek a decisive nationwide resolution in the courts on equality-based grounds has encouraged the most divisive possible method of implementing same-sex marriage, doing so not by demonstrating the benefits of liberty or enlisting the voters but by 1) delegitimizing all the aspects of marriage that are seen as obstacles to equalizing same-sex marriage with opposite-sex marriage and 2) demonizing anyone who opposes this process as the equivalent of Bull Connor.

Recall that the legal basis for challenges to laws restricting marriage to one man and one woman are based on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides:

No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. (emphasis added)

Now, there is no evidence that any of the voters or legislators who agreed to this amendment in 1868 had any reason to think they were outlawing the traditional American and Christian definition of marriage. Indeed, only a decade later, in Reynolds v. U.S., the Supreme Court held that the Western marriage tradition’s exclusion of polygamy was crucial to Congress’ authority to ban the practice:

Polygamy has always been odious among the northern and western nations of Europe, and, until the establishment of the Mormon Church, was almost exclusively a feature of the life of Asiatic and of African people. At common law, the second marriage was always void…and from the earliest history of England polygamy has been treated as an offence against society…



From that day to this we think it may safely be said there never has been a time in any State of the Union when polygamy has not been an offence against society, cognizable by the civil courts and punishable with more or less severity. In the face of all this evidence, it is impossible to believe that the constitutional guaranty of religious freedom was intended to prohibit legislation in respect to this most important feature of social life. Marriage, while from its very nature a sacred obligation, is nevertheless, in most civilized nations, a civil contract, and usually regulated by law. Upon it society may be said to be built, and out of its fruits spring social relations and social obligations and duties, with which government is necessarily required to deal. (emphasis added)

The Supreme Court’s seminal 1965 decision in Griswold v. Connecticut, which created a constitutional “right to privacy” that led the court to strike down a state law against contraceptives, likewise explicitly grounded the “fundamental” nature of that right in the history and tradition of marriage:

Would we allow the police to search the sacred precincts of marital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of contraceptives? The very idea is repulsive to the notions of privacy surrounding the marriage relationship.



We deal with a right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights — older than our political parties, older than our school system. Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred. It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects. Yet it is an association for as noble a purpose as any involved in our prior decisions. (emphasis added)

The Comparison to Interracial Marriage Bans Doesn’t Work

But even if we assume for the sake of argument that the Equal Protection Clause means, not what the people agreed to put in the Constitution but rather what modern judicial gloss has revised it to mean, the Constitution has always been read to permit the government to treat different things differently, so long as there was some rational basis for the distinction in the first place. (This recognition is precisely why the law has always treated the real, biological category of sex differently from the irrational category of racial classification, and why proponents of same-sex marriage have expended so much effort on appealing to special, extra-constitutional rules of burden-shifting, e.g., Romer v Evans, that in practice apply only in LGBT cases).

The common analogy drawn by supporters of same-sex marriage is to the court’s delightfully captioned 1967 decision in Loving v. Virginia, which struck down a law preventing interracial marriages between white and non-white people. But Loving is a terrible analogy. Race discrimination is, as the Loving Court noted, precisely what the Fourteenth Amendment was passed to combat:

The clear and central purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to eliminate all official state sources of invidious racial discrimination in the States….There can be no question but that Virginia’s miscegenation statutes rest solely upon distinctions drawn according to race. The statutes proscribe generally accepted conduct if engaged in by members of different races….The fact that Virginia prohibits only interracial marriages involving white persons demonstrates that the racial classifications must stand on their own justification, as measures designed to maintain White Supremacy….While Virginia prohibits whites from marrying any nonwhite (subject to the exception for the descendants of Pocahontas), Negroes, Orientals, and any other racial class may intermarry without statutory interference. (emphasis added)

Unlike opposite-sex marriage, bans on interracial marriage were not deeply rooted in Western society; they were unknown in English common law and had no basis in the traditions of Christian Europe, and were introduced by a 1661 Maryland law that tied the ban directly to slavery. Seven of the original 13 colonies had no such laws at the time the Constitution was written (Pennsylvania repealed its in 1780), one that did (Massachusetts) had repealed it by the time of the Fourteenth Amendment, and most of the other five were under military occupation in 1868.

The argument in court is that there can never be any rational basis at all to oppose same-sex marriage.

In fact, the social and religious importance of marriage was an essential part of the subsequent campaign against bans on interracial marriage. The first successful challenge to an interracial marriage ban, the 1948 California case Perez v. Sharp, was brought by a Catholic couple who argued that the ban infringed on their religious liberty to marry (citing among other things a 1937 Pius XI encyclical against Nazi theories of racial purity). A coalition of Catholic bishops filed an amicus brief in Loving opposing the Virginia law. And Loving itself grounded its view of the fundamental nature of the right to marriage in the connection of marriage to procreation, citing a 1942 case involving forcible sterilization: “Marriage is one of the ‘basic civil rights of man,’ fundamental to our very existence and survival.”

The Equal Protection argument is not about whether the case for same-sex marriage is better policy than the case against it; the argument in court is that there can never be any rational basis at all to oppose same-sex marriage. Thus, the courts can rule in favor of same-sex marriage only by issuing public declarations that the law considers everyone opposed to same-sex marriage to be an irrational bigot driven by an insensible animus. Courts have fallen consistently into the habit of doing just that. This is a scorched-earth strategy of total delegitimization. It is emblemized by the promiscuous deployment of the term “homophobic,” which literally seeks to diagnose anyone disagreeing with this legal and policy agenda, or holding scripturally-based religious views, as suffering from a mental illness.

Two Men Are Not the Same as a Man and Woman

Yet, as I have discussed at much greater length before, there very obviously are real differences between opposite-sex and same-sex marriage, and the courts therefore can reach the contrary conclusion only by declaring that all such distinctions are inadmissible in a judicial proceeding—that the rational-basis test is not permitted to consider any evidence that might disturb the desired conclusion. Undoubtedly, the courts have the raw power to do this, but it is a thin reed on which to hang the moral legitimacy of such a sea change in American law and culture, and Christians can hardly be blamed for deeming such judicial legerdemain itself irrational.

Marriage is both an intensely private relationship and a public, social institution of vital importance to the communities upon which government rests.

The core problem with dividing the aspects of marriage into the admissible and inadmissible is that it has the government’s interest in marriage precisely backwards, and in so doing, denigrates the basis for centuries-old public recognition of marriage to the point where there is hardly anything left to support it.

Marriage is both an intensely private relationship and a public, social institution of vital importance to the communities upon which government rests. This was once a commonly accepted distinction: whether or not you regard them as good constitutional law, the public side of marriage animated the Supreme Court’s decision upholding the ban on polygamy in Reynolds as inconsistent with the institution’s history, tradition and, social purposes, while the private side animated its decision in Griswold striking down the ban on contraceptives as an unwarranted government intrusion into the private domain of sex. Yet the arguments in favor of “marriage equality” contend that only the private aspects of marriage are of legitimate public concern (excluding, of course, the sacramental nature of marriage to a great many of its participants); the public aspects may not ever be considered.

Marriage, Public and Private

Marriage existed as a social and religious institution long before the government got involved in issuing marriage licenses, handling divorces and child custody disputes, and (with the comparatively recent invention of the income tax) granting favorable tax treatment to married couples. Yet the government’s relationship with marriage has grown along with the rest of government in the past century, to the point where it would be practically impossible to unscramble the egg.

Government’s relationship with marriage has grown along with the rest of government in the past century, to the point where it would be practically impossible to unscramble the egg.

But why is marriage the government’s business at all? Because marriage is an expression of love? You have never needed a government license to love someone, and let us all pray we never will. Because marriage involves sex? The government does have some interest in sex—for example, preventing coercive sex (e.g., rape, incest, sex with children). There are other public interests in sex—preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, preventing the social conflict that can result from adultery—but outside of bans on prostitution, most Americans tend to view the public interests that might justify government policing of sex as being easily outweighed by the private interest in keeping it private.

It is hard to argue that the government has any particular interest in non-procreative sex between couples (of the opposite sex or the same sex) that would justify the thousands of federal, state, and local laws on the books that address marriage. Love and sex are by their nature the private side of marriage, the aspects of marriage in which the government has the least interest and from which it should be kept at the greatest distance.

By contrast, marriage is also a social institution, one that has built up a lot of social capital and respect in our society. The opponents of the traditional definition of marriage want to have this both ways. In the Proposition 8 litigation, the plaintiffs argued (and the District Court and the Ninth Circuit agreed) that the whole reason they had standing to sue—why they had an injury a federal court was empowered to remedy—was that same-sex couples were denied these social benefits for their relationship.

It might seem curious to justify courts changing the law solely to promote social respect. But it is a flagrantly disingenuous argument coming from litigants and judges who in the same breath argued that the very sources of that social respect—the history and tradition of the institution, its religious heritage, the extent to which it reflects the value judgments of the electorate—were wholly irrational considerations the courts must otherwise ignore.

The Public Interest in Marriage Is Children

Marriage is a public economic unit, although in the absence of children or the prospect of children, the public interest in the economic union of two adults is also fairly weak, beyond the enforcement of private contracts (which can be done with civil-union statutes). Traditionally, marriage was essential to the economic well-being of women because they lacked the opportunities to work to support themselves that men had. This remains true to an extent even today (statistically, married women are vastly less likely than unmarried women to live in poverty), due in large part to women being far more likely to end up as single parents. But if the economic interest in marriage is premised on the gender-equity consideration of a woman’s need for a man’s paycheck, that is a case only for opposite-sex marriage, not for marriages that involve either two men or two women.

In 1880, in Maynard v Hill, the Supreme Court explained that state legislatures have the power to grant divorces without running afoul of the Constitution’s prohibition on states abrogating contracts because the public, social character of marriage renders it something beyond a private contract:

[W]hile marriage is often termed by text writers and in decisions of courts as a civil contract, generally to indicate that it must be founded upon the agreement of the parties, and does not require any religious ceremony for its solemnization, it is something more than a mere contract. The consent of the parties is, of course, essential to its existence, but when the contract to marry is executed by the marriage, a relation between the parties is created which they cannot change. Other contracts may be modified, restricted, or enlarged, or entirely released upon the consent of the parties. Not so with marriage. The relation once formed, the law steps in and holds the parties to various obligations and liabilities. It is an institution in the maintenance of which in its purity the public is deeply interested, for it is the foundation of the family and of society, without which there would be neither civilization nor progress. (emphasis added)

Any way you slice it, the vast apparatus of marriage law and family law makes sense as a public enterprise of concern to the government and the law only if you consider the role of marriage as an institution for having and raising children. As I have explained at exhaustive length before, no matter how many aspects of marriage you rule inadmissible and no matter how hard you squint at the data, you simply cannot make same-sex marriage and traditional opposite-sex marriage the same thing once you admit that children 1) are the primary public purpose of the institution and 2) play a dramatically different role in opposite-sex marriage than in same-sex marriage (and in opposite-sex unmarried couples as compared to same-sex unmarried couples).

Without repeating that entire argument here, there are four basic reasons (aside from the gender-equity point noted above) why it is completely rational to consider opposite-sex couples different from same-sex couples for purposes of the public aspects of marriage.

First, opposite-sex married couples, for obvious biological reasons, are vastly more likely to have children. North of 80 percent of married couples in the prime childbearing years are engaged in raising children, two or three times the rate for same-sex couples even before you factor in the far higher frequency of opposite-sex couples having more than one or two children.

Second, the state has a much greater interest in encouraging marriage among opposite-sex than same-sex couples because opposite-sex couples are (again, for obvious reasons of basic biology) otherwise apt to have children outside marriage, at rates that have reached crisis levels for our society in recent decades. The state has nothing resembling a similarly urgent interest in whether same-sex couples get or stay married or not. Combined with the prior point, there is an enormous public interest in encouraging and maintaining opposite-sex marriage, and no comparable interest exists encouraging same-sex marriage (without which the nation survived its first two centuries).

Third, there is nothing irrational about the state treating both mothers and fathers as having something of value to add to a child’s life, and therefore maintaining that it is preferable for children, whenever feasible, to be raised in a home with both a mother and a father. It is a measure of the unreality of our current debate that it is considered a radical notion to value both motherhood and fatherhood.

There is nothing irrational about the state treating both mothers and fathers as having something of value to add to a child’s life.

We have a vast body of common human experience—vaster than anything a social scientist could ever hope to assemble, and covering a wide swath of elements of human experience that defy quantification—to support this value judgment, and the whole point of democracy is to let ordinary citizens draw on common experience. Marriage in every society in human history around the globe until about 1990 has been solely between men and women, and marriage in Christian jurisdictions over the past 2,000 years—including the whole history of the United States – has been not only male-female but one-man-one-woman (Christian societies have also generally dispensed with the pre-Christian and non-Christian practice of child brides, contributing to the stable nature of the institution over time). We also have an enormous bulk of social-science data (much of it from single-parent families, but not all, by any means) on the specific problems that fatherless or motherless children face, which is consistent with that experience.

Set against that is a hodgepodge of “studies” done only in the past 25 years, and designed primarily with the goal of promoting one side in litigation. Those studies are almost entirely derived from self-selected non-random samples, assembled and evaluated by people uniformly supportive of same-sex marriage. Such studies don’t need to withstand enough scrutiny to create a lasting consensus on the issue. They only need to preserve the appearance of one for another few weeks, because given how legal precedent operates, when the Supreme Court says there’s no rational basis for something, it will never, ever revisit that question no matter what subsequent evidence proves (recall that the courts have refused to reconsider whether the state of medical science on abortion has changed since 1973).

Those studies are almost entirely derived from self-selected non-random samples, assembled and evaluated by people uniformly supportive of same-sex marriage.

While LGBT activists claim that the social science derived from such studies is unanimously and permanently settled around the proposition that it is impossible for, say, a mother to add anything to a child’s life that two men could not provide (and they do indeed argue such things), as I explained further in my prior essay, this is both 1) an irresponsible overstatement of what the “scientific data” supports and 2) a dangerously undemocratic substitution of the value judgments and priorities of a small and unrepresentative coterie of like-minded social scientists for those of the ordinary lay voter who is supposed to have the final say on matters of such everyday experience as the raising of children.

Fourth, it is likewise at minimum an open question—given the fragmentary and often unfavorable data we have from countries and states with a decade or two of experience with legally sanctioned same-sex unions—whether same-sex unions as a group can or will sustain rates of family stability or monogamy that are at all comparable to those traditionally observed (even in today’s weakened state for marriage) in opposite-sex marriages. Indeed, the main criticism leveled at the major random U.S. study of the children of gay parents was that its random sampling contained too many broken homes and too few long-term stable same-sex households to justify drawing any conclusions. It would require an exercise in legal fiction to pretend that we have the kind of robust, stable data on this question to settle it forever as a matter of permanent constitutional law premised upon the impossibility of any rational evidence supporting a distinction rooted deeply in human experience.

The Problem With Pretending

In short, the equality argument, as applied to marriage, requires us to pretend something that is not so. If that is problematic as a matter of law and policy as applied to the public, secular aspects of marriage, it is even more so as a matter of daily life when Christians are asked to affirm the equivalence of same-sex relationships with the sacrament of matrimony. To say “this doesn’t affect your marriage” ignores how the whole reworking of the judicially admissible justifications for marriage embeds itself in our law and our culture. You cannot display an “equals sign” in your social-media profile without making a statement about the value of what’s on both sides.

You cannot display an ‘equals sign’ in your social-media profile without making a statement about the value of what’s on both sides.

To illustrate as a matter of faith and culture why the “equals sign” is particularly offensive to many Christians, consider an example. There is no question that, as a legal matter, I have a constitutional right to celebrate a bar mitzvah (technically, in Jewish culture, the bar mitzvah is what happens when you reach the age of manhood; the celebration just ritualizes social recognition of it). It’s an important ritual with significant and intertwined religious and cultural meaning.

But I’m a Christian. A bar mitzvah, as a distinctively Jewish ceremony, is not something I would want or be able to use. Have I been denied a basic human right, because young Jewish men had bar mitzvahs at age 13 and I did not? Or is the issue simply that we have unequal access to a bar mitzvah because it suits our lives and our faith in unequal ways?

What if Christians started insisting on giving their sons bar mitzvahs, but substituting Christian readings and professions of Christian faith, while insisting on retaining the term “bar mitzvah” and then deploying the machinery of the law to target anyone who took issue with this? I have to believe that many Jews, for perfectly valid reasons, would at a minimum regard this not only as an appropriation of their cultural heritage, but as something of a crude parody of it, would want nothing to do with it, and would be appalled at being hauled into court for refusing to participate in one. So it is, for many Christians, when the name and status of a ceremony that is sacred and sacramental in our own church and central to the practice of our own lives is appropriated to have a completely different meaning—then told that law and society disapproves of us even mentioning the distinction.

Ain’t No Rest For Lawyers

Reliance on the Equal Protection rationale also has a number of potential legal consequences, including some fairly immediate and specific risks for church and church-affiliated institutions like schools: that they could lose their tax exemption, as the Supreme Court ruled could happen to Bob Jones University in a famous 1983 Supreme Court case over its ban on interracial dating, if they treat same-sex marriage as different from opposite-sex marriage.

Is this a fanciful possibility? None other than the Obama administration’s chief lawyer admitted to the Supreme Court in the same-sex marriage argument that “it’s certainly going to be an issue. I don’t deny that.” Anyone remotely familiar with the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice should regard that as a not-even-barely-concealed threat. Indeed, stripping churches and religiously-affiliated schools, hospitals and charities of tax benefits and participation in public programs is already a popular cause among Progressive activists, and will doubtless be seized upon as a further reason to use administrative agencies and courts to impose legal mandates (like the contraception mandate), obstruct school-choice programs, etc.

There is more to come right around the corner, the unending march of which gives the lie to the idea that Equal Protection litigation is about “live and let live”:

After Massachusetts redefined marriage to include same-sex relationships, Catholic Charities of Boston was forced to discontinue its adoption services rather than place children with same-sex couples against its principles. Massachusetts public schools began teaching grade-school students about same-sex marriage, defending their decision because they are “committed to teaching about the world they live in, and in Massachusetts same-sex marriage is legal.” A Massachusetts appellate court ruled that parents have no right to exempt their children from these classes….Georgetown University law professor Chai Feldblum, an appointee to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, argues that the push to redefine marriage trumps religious liberty concerns: ‘[F]or all my sympathy for the evangelical Christian couple who may wish to run a bed and breakfast from which they can exclude unmarried, straight couples and all gay couples, this is a point where I believe the “zero-sum” nature of the game inevitably comes into play. And, in making that decision in this zero-sum game, I am convinced society should come down on the side of protecting the liberty of LGBT people.’ (emphasis added)

Additional legal consequences loom from the logic of 1) denying that children are a crucial part of the public interest in marriage and 2) denying any unique value to fatherhood or motherhood. Consider the impact on child-custody disputes, which despite the fervent hopes of utopian libertarians have no chance of ever being privatized and thus out of the hands of the courts. While many states’ laws have eliminated the old de jure preference for giving custody of a child to the mother, there is still such a presumption de facto—but a decision holding that the sex of a parent is an irrational consideration will give new ammunition to custody-seeking fathers, as family court judges will be faced with the U.S. Supreme Court lecturing them not to be irrational bigots who think mothers do anything that a father can’t replace. And custody battles raise new and thorny questions when existing laws are applied to same-sex couples:

At common law — to my knowledge, even now the law of almost every state — a child born into a marriage is presumed to be a child of the marriage. That is, the husband is presumed to be the father, the wife the mother.



Let us assume same-sex ‘marriage’ becomes the law of the land…In a ‘marriage’ between two lesbians, one somehow gets pregnant…Now, what happens when the actual father, the biological one, pops up and claims his parental rights? Each state resolves this question differently, but the underlying assumption is that the marriage at issue involves a male and a female, and that the female gave birth, and so the male is presumed to be the father, absent pretty impressive evidence to the contrary.



But in that lesbian ‘marriage’, should the other woman who despite our linguistic contortions cannot father children be presumed to be a parent? Should the standard for establishing paternity be lowered? Is she entitled to the presumption that the child is hers? Is that itself (or its contrapositive) a violation of the Equal Protection Clause (and state variants)?

These may all seem like dire and extreme predictions, just as predictions about courts imposing same-sex marriage did 10 or 15 years ago, but I ask you, if you are a supporter of same-sex marriage: what were you saying to yourself about my arguments just a few paragraphs ago? Were you resisting the idea that having a mother and a father is best for a child, or that any sensible person could think there’s evidence to support that? Were you saying to yourself that all this religious stuff is just cover for irrational bigotry? Were you telling yourself that everything I’m saying right now will go the way of the arguments for “separate but equal”? Because if you were telling yourself those things, and you want the courts to believe them (because believing otherwise means finding a rational basis for traditional marriage laws), you cannot well be surprised if the essential underpinnings of your argument end up as the law. And the engine of litigation never rests.

There is no requirement that the civil definition of marriage precisely track the religious definition; indeed, in a country that observes no religious establishment, it is often the case that the civil law is different from the religious. But when the law declares that two things are the same when they are not, and commands us to affirm and help celebrate a thing that is not so, its logic will inevitably compel us to conform our actions to that fiction.

This puts Christians to the test of their duty to avoid scandal. And when the law derides any request for respect for individual conscience as an invidious form of irrational bigotry, as many judicial opinions have done and as critics of religious-liberty bills have done, the stage is set for an existential struggle.

In a battle for liberty, Christians and gays can both win. But when the argument is over equality and the perspectives involved are in such dramatic collision, one side must sooner or later be found more equal than the other.

Can Gays And Christians Coexist In America? Part V,"In parts I, II, III, and IV of this essay, I examined the problem: why Christians face increasing demands to accept same-sex marriage and homosexual sex not as voluntary conduct but as essential components of personal identity, and why the nature of Christian theology would require Christians to renounce their own faith identities to do so. In this final part, I look at the prospects for a solution or, at any rate, an armistice.

As I noted at the outset of part I of this series, we do not live in a live-and-let-live society; we live, increasingly, in one in which organized pressure campaigns and administrative and legal proceedings are brought to bear on people who take a traditional religious approach to same-sex relationships. As I noted in parts III and IV, the root cause of that conflict is the insistence on modeling the “gay rights” battles after the litigation strategy used against Jim Crow. You could cite examples all day of how this leads to aggressive efforts to force religious believers to renounce their own consciences:

The New Mexico Human Rights Commission prosecuted a photographer for declining to photograph a same-sex ‘commitment ceremony.’ Doctors in California were successfully sued for declining to perform an artificial insemination on a woman in a same-sex relationship. Owners of a bed and breakfast in Illinois who declined to rent their facility for a same-sex civil union ceremony and reception were sued for violating the state nondiscrimination law. A Georgia counselor was fired after she referred someone in a same-sex relationship to another counselor….

This is to say nothing of more radical efforts on the Left to seek more fundamental changes to the institution of marriage, by severing its link to children and redefining its rules about monogamy, or viewing marriage itself as a form of inequality that privileges the married over the unmarried. Such efforts may seem a longer shot right now, but we know they will never lack for media, academic, and entertainment friends eager to “mainstream” them.

Outside the United States, with its residual constitutional protections for speech and religion, the situation is even grimmer, ranging from a U.K. lawsuit to force churches to perform same-sex weddings to a Canadian “hate speech” case against a Christian pamphleteer, which ended with the Supreme Court of Canada ruling against the pamphleteer, albeit while beating back efforts to deem Biblical quotations themselves to be “hate speech.”

But while powerful forces already in motion lead us further into conflict, it does not need to be our inevitable and permanent condition.

Christianity Birthed the Ideas of Religious and Political Tolerance

At this point, it is useful to step back and review the historical roots of the Western ideas of Christian liberty and religious tolerance. At its origin, Christianity began as a minority religion, persecuted by the Roman and Jewish authorities. Jesus, unlike the earthly founders of some other world religions, never sought civil or military authority, and was ultimately put to death by the government. He insisted at all times that his kingdom was of heaven, and not of this world. He essentially invented the concept of separation of church and state by the injunction, radical in its time, that his followers pay to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s. His only direct teachings on government were against corruption and abuse of power by tax collectors and soldiers who used their positions to extort money from subjects under their thumb.

While all legitimate Christian morality derives from God, all legitimate civil law must rest on a foundation of popular consent.

The rest of the New Testament is not much more engaged on the topic, although Paul and the other apostles did devote a lot of attention to guiding how the new community of Christian believers should live. As discussed in part II, while Christianity’s individual moral teachings are mostly quite clear, this has left a lot of room for contention and criticism over Christianity’s role in shaping society as a whole.

The distinction between the City of God and the City of Man was developed at much greater length by St. Augustine of Hippo, the great North African Catholic philosopher. Augustine wrote in the early fifth century when the church had gained control of much civil authority only to see it disintegrating under barbarian invasion. It remains a wise distinction today: Christian moral philosophy can and should inform the governing authorities (as it has always done in Western society in general and America in particular), because it is wise and just and humane, and because, in the real world, the faith of the governed is always relevant to self-government.

But ultimately, while all legitimate Christian morality—including the natural-law basis of our individual rights—derives from God, all legitimate civil law must rest on a foundation of popular consent. We should be under no illusion that the two will always be in harmony, but when they come directly into conflict, terrible things can happen.

In Search of a Westphalian Peace

Following the Protestant Reformation in the early sixteenth century, Europe erupted in religious wars; not for the first time, but surely the bloodiest. Christians, by then ensconced in civil authority and accustomed to civil power (and sometimes its corruptions), sought by the sword to stamp out what Catholics regarded as heresy and Protestants regarded as fundamental corruption within the Catholic Church. The carnage reached its apogee in the Thirty Years’ War of 1618-48, which by some estimates killed anywhere from a quarter to 40 percent of the population of what would later be Germany and set back its political development by two centuries.

The Christian nation-states of Europe agreed amongst themselves to accept different religious doctrines and to cease going to war in order to change them.

The war ended in 1648 with the Peace of Westphalia. While many aspects of the Westphalian order would be crucial to European and world history, the important point for the history of religious pluralism is that the Christian nation-states of Europe agreed amongst themselves to accept different religious doctrines and to cease going to war in order to change them. Issues of sectarian tolerance would be localized to within states, rather than being the main driving force in cross-border wars among them.

It would take time for that principle to trickle down to pluralism within a nation’s population. The next few decades would see nations like England and France turn the screws on their religious minorities (the British Isles would be convulsed with religious strife, and the persecution of Catholics in particular, for most of the seventeenth century). Moreover, the Westphalian settlement was never accepted by Europe’s Muslim neighbors, and mostly was not applied to them by the powers of Christendom, either. But the core principle—we are willing to live with the reality that some of our neighbors do not share our view of the deepest truths—led in the fullness of time to a better, more stable accommodation of sectarian differences.

Eventually, the idea of religious freedom within a state would find its greatest flowering in our own country, which was originally colonized by people far more urgently concerned with religious liberty than with, say, democracy, free speech, or free markets. Contrary to what twenty-first-century liberal-progressives would have you believe, neither the original colonists nor the Founding Fathers were strict devotees of a separation of church and state.

The Pilgrims, to pick the most obvious example, came to America mainly so they could find establish their own community with their own religion as its organizing principle. At the time the First Amendment was written, several states still had their own established state churches, and the Establishment Clause was written as much as anything to protect them from being supplanted by a federal established church. Even in later years, as the states abandoned established churches, groups ranging from the Mormons to the Amish to the Hasidim have worked to create communities in which they could set the dominant governing tone reflecting their own principles. This, too, is a form of religious freedom.

The Crucial Principle Is Accepting Differences

But the old Westphalian settlement, as refined by American practice, always demanded that every religious group accept that the existence of the others. Vibrant religious communities could exist in a pluralistic society so long as they did not see one another’s insistence on practicing their own faith as an affront to themselves. Distinct communities with distinct values could coexist so long as they all accepted a baseline of pluralism. The more government and its inherently value-embodying rules were set at the local level, the easier this settlement was to sustain. The Peace of Westphalia could never have existed in the Roman Empire, or even the modern European Union.

Distinct communities with distinct values could coexist so long as they all accepted a baseline of pluralism.

We are in danger of losing that settlement in America today, as illustrated both by the furious reaction to the Supreme Court’s Hobby Lobby decision and by the rhetoric deployed in fights over religious liberty in the LGBT-rights context, to the point where the liberal and progressive writers rarely mention religious liberty without scare quotes, and the president for years now has pointedly talked about “freedom of worship” instead of the more robust freedom to practice faith. The governor of Utah even faced an uproar over the seemingly uncontroversial view that state executives should defend and enforce their own states’ laws.

Given the tendency in some corners to regard the existence of traditional, orthodox Christianity as an affront that must be stamped out via boycotts and public and legal pressure, the old Westphalian settlement is more endangered now than it has ever been. The activists who relish the prospect of this conflict are certain they can win, but as the Thirty Years War illustrated, such conflicts often produce no winners. But if good fences are needed to make good neighbors, where to build the fence? Where does it all stop?

Is There A Way Forward?

In war—and all political and legal conflict is war by other means—the easiest way to prop up the morale of your opponents once their defeat becomes obvious and inevitable is to convince them that there is no safe way to surrender. To choose the ugliest example, some of the bloodiest and bitterest fighting of the European theater of World War II was in the final weeks of the Eastern Front, culminating in the Battle of Berlin.

The easiest way to prop up the morale of your opponents once their defeat becomes inevitable is to convince them that there is no safe way to surrender.

The German Army, without hope of victory or truce, fought with desperate, cornered ferocity because hundreds of thousands of German civilians were evacuating behind its line of retreat, and because the victorious Soviet Red Army was utterly merciless in its advance, reaping revenge for extensive prior German atrocities with a vast campaign of rape and savagery. There was no upside in a soft retreat before such an advance, even if Germany had been ruled by a less psychotic regime in spring 1945. (Most political battles aren’t waged between Hitler and Stalin, but the lesson applies in any conflict).

It is, by now, inevitable that same-sex marriage will be the law of most if not all states in the United States, and recognized nationally by the federal government. The political opposition to same-sex marriage has been collapsing in the past three to five years, and is now sustained primarily by fear that Christian opponents have not been offered any way in which to protect their own competing interests.

At this point, the chief obstacle to conservative acquiescence in same-sex marriage, however grudging, is a very well-founded fear that there is no stopping point—that today’s concession of the legal legitimacy of same-sex marriage will be taken as an invitation for tomorrow’s invasion of any remaining preserve of conscience in which people can reserve their own dissent. The florid rage of Democrats and liberal-progressives over the Supreme Court’s comparatively modest and narrow Hobby Lobby decision just drives home how emboldened the opposition has become to any safe haven for Christian conscience in any walk of life. It also reminds us how little regard the active parts of the Democratic Party have for the notion that Christian beliefs are worthy of being treated by the government and society as legitimate and real, as opposed to superstitious, backwards, and pretextual.

Defending the First Amendment

Behind the facade of a flurry of defensive activity, weariness with this topic is everywhere among Christians and conservatives. One of the iron laws of political gravity is that, if you’re not on offense, you will just keep losing ground until you have nothing remaining to lose, and thus we see conservative Christians filing religious-liberty lawsuits and proposing religious-liberty legislation.

Defenders of religious liberty have allowed themselves to be divided, isolated, and defeated in detail by smaller but more cohesive, angrier adversaries who have consistently dictated the time and terms of engagement.

These are indeed necessary steps, and they will succeed only if we have the courage of our convictions not only to propose them but to defend them with the same unashamed zeal as the opponents of religious liberty. That has not been in evidence: governors like Mike Pence, Jan Brewer, Nathan Deal, Asa Hutchinson, and Pat McCrory, who are in principle supportive of the idea, have either lacked the courage to follow through on religious-liberty protections or lacked a strategy to plainly and openly defend them against what are now predictable organized pressure campaigns by social activists and their allies in large corporations.

Defenders of religious liberty have allowed themselves to be divided, isolated, and defeated in detail by smaller but more cohesive, angrier adversaries who have consistently dictated the time and terms of engagement. But boycotts collapse when they have to be applied to too many targets at once. If proponents of liberty band together in these fights like the slaves at the end of Spartacus, they will do just fine (of course, the slaves got crucified together, and that is always a possible outcome—but then, the Romans were no ordinary adversary).

But offense is just a tactic; the end goal must be a stable, Westphalian line of armistice. If there is a way forward, if it is possible for Christians to be tolerated in twenty-first-century America rather than treated like bitter-ender opponents of desegregation, it will only be found if supporters of same-sex marriage decide at some point that things have gone far enough, should not go much further, and that the time for conciliation and compromise has come.

The impetus for this will never come from the zealots, but it is possible that it will emerge from the broader mass of voters who have followed them in recent years, and it will likely become visible only in retrospect from election returns, and from the actions of nominally apolitical institutions. The fact that the outcome is mostly out of Christian hands does not mean there is nothing we can do. An affirmative agenda for compromise means demanding respect and protection for religious liberty, but it also requires offering something in return.

What would that something look like? One element, of course, is for Christians, conservatives, and Republicans to demonstrate a greater personal ease with gay Americans, as people. As frustrated as we may get with the flagrantly one-sided nature of the public, media debate, we need to be happy warriors, keeping our calm and our cool and showing with deeds, not just words, that our disagreements on matters of deep principle do not prevent us from treating others with the love and respect that the Gospel demands of us. That’s not always easy in an emotional political fight; we have to work at it, and we must.

Hate the Crime

On a concrete political level, there are two particular areas in which ideological combat has obscured the potential for bridge-building common ground. One of these is hate crimes. Violence may not be a day-to-day threat for most gay Americans, but anyone who has been—or seen a loved one be—on the receiving end of violence can testify to the outsize impact it has.

Hate crimes are disproportionately harmful for exactly the same reason terrorism is: targeting strangers for violence out of the blue over an animus or a cause sends a message of terror

While sensational stories like the Matthew Shepard case tend to turn out to be more myth than reality, hate crimes against homosexuals (especially gay men) are a real thing, and cracking down on violence to ensure that all enjoy the equal protection of the laws is the first duty of government. Much of that can be done simply by executive enforcement priorities at the local, state and occasionally federal prosecutor level, and by raising law enforcement awareness, but legislation can at times be an appropriate tool as well.

Some conservatives instinctively dislike “hate crimes” laws for two related reasons. First, they risk creating “thought crimes” that punish motive, rather than punishing the same violent act the same way. I used to be more sympathetic to this view pre-9/11, but the reality is that hate crimes are disproportionately harmful for exactly the same reason terrorism is: targeting strangers for violence out of the blue over an animus or a cause sends a message of terror to anyone who could envision the same thing happening to them.

The “thought crime” aspect can be resolved by the simple expedient of writing such laws to punish, not “hate” as a motive, but rather crimes whose objective circumstances look to a reasonable observer like a hate crime. After all, the harm caused by a gay-bashing attack is done by the public act of, say, yelling slurs while jumping a guy outside a gay bar, not by the private act of what the attacker may have read in books or on the Internet.

Second, hate-crimes laws are criticized for creating unequal “protected classes” of crime victims. But like the thought-crimes problem, this is mainly the fault of poor drafting of such laws (which encourages their uneven application) rather than an inherent flaw. Rather than enumerate a series of exclusive categories, it’s entirely proper to cover all forms of hate crime that appear to an objective observer to have resulted from selecting a victim based on some observable or perceived characteristic rather than due to financial or sexual motives, escalation of a pre-existing or personal conflict, etc.

Freedom to Work

Another area where common ground is possible, but harder to forge, is employment discrimination. Again, at a general level, the majority of Christians and the majority of conservatives and Republicans would all agree that gay people should not face discrimination in finding work, due either to their orientation itself or due to disapproval of their sexual choices and relationships.

Outside of government, Christians can help alleviate that with a mindset of inclusion, even at some risk to ourselves of the potential for hiring someone who might end up setting the machinery of the law against us—something people are less likely to do to a boss who treats them with respect and decency.

The problem of translating the non-discrimination principle into legislation is threefold, but again, none should be insurmountable if there exists anyone with whom good-faith compromise is possible. First is the slippery-slope problem: many conservatives fear that enshrining sexual orientation next to race and gender in the law’s list of protected categories for one purpose will encourage the courts to treat it the same way for all purposes, even when there are rational distinctions to be drawn. This is where our experience with the Seven Stages of Liberal Legal Activism become a factor:

It’s a free country, X should not be illegal. The Constitution prohibits X from being made illegal. If the Constitution protects a right to X, how can it be immoral? Anyone who disagrees is a bigot. If X is a constitutional right, how can we deny it to the poor? Taxpayer money must be given to people to get X. The Constitution requires that taxpayer money be given to people to get X. People who refuse to participate in X are criminals. People who publicly disagree with X are criminals.

In the words of Dune’s Muad’Dib: “When I am weaker than you, I ask you for freedom because that is according to your principles; when I am stronger than you, I take away your freedom because that is according to my principles.” Given the frequency with which the Seven Stages have been deployed by liberal-progressives over the years, it is the wisdom of experience never to believe the sincerity of any liberal-progressive promises of a stopping point or a limiting principle, and that mistrust makes compromise difficult.

But it’s also a reason to act now to enshrine a middle ground in legislation rather than trust in the courts. The biggest-ticket question of all—marriage—is a horse that may have left the barn by the end of this month. The goal for Christians and other faithful now must be to drain the momentum of the activists by picking more defensible terrain and winning over their less-committed allies—a time-tested defensive strategy in politics as in war.

Second and relatedly is the fact that our anti-discrimination laws, especially in employment, are already dysfunctional, burdensome, and the cause of too much federal overreach, too much unwarranted litigation, and too much litigation-avoidance behavior. This is why even some supporters of same-sex marriage are skeptical about the federal Employment Non-Discrimination Act. But Republicans in Congress and the states, in many cases elected with the support of Christians and other religious people, have a governing majority now and should act like one. New anti-discrimination laws don’t need to repeat the mistakes of the old ones, but can instead be written as a model for reform.

It is the wisdom of experience never to believe the sincerity of any liberal-progressive promises of a stopping point or a limiting principle, and that mistrust makes compromise difficult.

The third problem is the direct, practical one, also a challenge of creative drafting but a hill worth dying on for those who oppose having the courts dictate everything: coming up with legislative ways to distinguish (or more carefully guide courts in distinguishing) between situations of improper discrimination (e.g., denying a gay person a job as an accountant) and situations in which religious interests should legitimately take precedence (e.g., a Christian school exercising the right to decide it would cross the line into scandal to employ a teacher who is openly in a same-sex marriage, or indeed who openly dissents from church teachings).

This kind of line-drawing is what we pay legislators to do, and not so far in the past, it was a bipartisan occupation. The 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act at issue in Hobby Lobby was largely written by Sen. Chuck Schumer and signed into law by Bill Clinton. In fact, the recently written state RFRA laws have made some efforts at doing this. Again, the biggest obstacle to compromise is that proponents of such bills need to speak up for their virtues without embarrassment if they want to give opponents a political downside for obstructing them.

Stop the Quacks

An example of a smaller issue on which there also ought to be a sensible middle ground is “gay conversion therapy.” On the one hand, the various quasi-medical efforts to “convert” gay people into having heterosexual desires are dominated by quackery, and state medical establishments should have a free hand in prohibiting them from passing themselves off as any sort of legitimate scientific or medical discipline, including by banning licensed doctors from participating. (The same should be done for the same reasons to “gender-reassignment” surgeries; that day will come in time, but don’t hold your breath on empirical science winning that battle over ideology in the near term).

The various quasi-medical efforts to ‘convert’ gay people into having heterosexual desires are dominated by quackery.

I don’t exclude the possibility that some people might in some cases be able to alter their sexual desires (human willpower and self-control are variable and not always well-understood; thus, if it is possible for some people to do an extraordinary and difficult thing, this does not prove that it is possible for all people; likewise, if some people cannot do a thing, this does not prove that nobody can), but there’s no scientific evidence that this can be done commonly or reliably.

On the other hand, gay Christians in particular should remain free to choose less formal forms of therapy—whether or not those are faith-based or contain some elements drawn from psychology or psychiatry—without the state stepping in to ban it.

Global Persecution

There should also be common ground on the persecution of homosexuals, which – like persecution of Christians – is open and bloody in many parts of the world. Some of that comes from more or less Christian jurisdictions like Uganda and Putin’s Russia. Much of the worst comes from the Muslim world, especially theocratic fanatics like ISIS, who are in the habit of stoning gays to death or tossing them off towers. Working together to protest the worst atrocities is a good way for Christians and gays to be reminded of the areas where their values and interests can overlap.

Extend Charity

Finally, there are many situations in which gay people, especially refugees and gay youths, are in need of charitable assistance, and not just monetary—teen runaways, asylum seekers, etc. Common efforts to provide charity may be hard to organize, because both Christians and secular gays are inclined to see people in soul-aching trouble as proper targets for the most well-intentioned sorts of proselytizing, and that means direct conflict. But Christians have long experience with interfaith relief efforts that skirt these sorts of fundamental conflicts, and can be creative here as well in meeting immediate needs for shelter and a welcome embrace.

There are many situations in which gay people, especially refugees and gay youths, are in need of charitable assistance, and not just monetary.

This is not an exhaustive list, and of course peaceful coexistence is easier with political allies, so gay Republicans and conservatives, and the dwindling minority of Christian liberals, also have a role to play in de-escalating the tendency to seek unconditional surrender rather than preserving space for liberty, dissent, and free exchange of ideas.

The likely friends of freedom also need to be of more help in standing up for a live-and-let-live ethos that gives breathing space to free exercise of religion. Many libertarians have tended, unfortunately, to retreat to slogans about getting the government out of marriage entirely, a stance that is 1) totally unrealistic, especially given the government role in divorce and child custody, and 2) further proof that same-sex marriage produces momentum for changes in government, law, and society that reduce the status of marriage generally.

Worse yet, many libertarians have chosen the side of big government on LGBT issues, rather than the side of protecting religious liberty. The more pro-SSM libertarians stand up for religious liberty, the more they can contribute to a broader social acceptance of liberty as a force for social peace.

Create Demilitarized Zones

Working together on common ground is a good first step to the two sides humanizing each other and learning the habits of compromise. But the final piece of the puzzle of armistice and coexistence is the need to demobilize the institutions that have been engaged in LGBT causes: Hollywood, the universities, media and entertainment companies like Disney/ESPN, and other big corporations. So long as those various entities are run and staffed by people who see Christians only in caricature and see LGBT causes through the prism of Jim Crow, conflict will never end.

So long as institutions are run and staffed by people who see Christians only in caricature and see LGBT causes through the prism of Jim Crow, conflict will never end.

Corporate pressure has been especially prominent in the recent culture wars on these issues. It was pressure from Guinness that made the biggest difference in the New York St. Patrick’s Day Parade controversy. Ditto Disney and the Boy Scouts, or a long list of corporations in the Indiana and Arkansas religious liberty fights.

It will be hard for Christians working in big companies to speak up in favor of religious liberty and against one-sided cultural and ideological activism; one of the leading lights of my profession was essentially driven out of his firm for representing the House of Representatives in defense of a federal law on this topic. That will take courage, but at some point, the Long March of progressive culture warriors can’t simply be conceded if we are ever to have a stable peace and broader cultural respect for the values of free expression and independent conscience rather than groupthink.

I think—I hope—that penning this essay is my own little contribution to that process; I would be a poor representative of my Biblical namesake if I didn’t try.

The Obstacles to Peace

All of these efforts may be helpful, or they may come to naught. One obstacle to any effort towards peaceful co-existence, as I noted in parts III and IV, is the momentum generated by seeking a resolution in the courts. If we were dealing solely with a democratic movement to rewrite the law premised on a weighing of society’s changing values—such as the recent referendum on marriage laws in Ireland—there might be no need to have this conversation.

Democrats no longer have any incentive to seek anything but constant, zero-sum conflict on these issues.

It is yet possible that the Supreme Court will more or less admit in its decision in Obergefell v. Hodges that it is simply making a value-driven policy decision that should have no other precedential effects, but that is not normally how the court works (even in Bush v. Gore, when the Supreme Court attempted to limit the decision to its facts in light of the haste of its decision and its grounding in stopping a runaway state court, the underlying principles took on a life of their own in subsequent election law cases). So the inertial force of litigation will likely make it hard to stop what has been set in motion.

Another obstacle is the Democratic Party. Even as recently as 2006, the Democrats as an institution were interested in persuading culturally moderate voters by appeals to broad-based issues of governance like economics and foreign policy. But the Obama era has thoroughly re-oriented the party around culture war as a tool for motivating young, liberally-inclined voters with little knowledge or interest in other issues.

In the past few years, the declining salience of the Iraq War has elevated LGBT issues to the party’s number one cultural wedge-issue priority (if you don’t believe me, spend a few days reading their fundraising emails). As a result, the Democrats no longer have any incentive to seek anything but constant, zero-sum conflict on these issues. So a Westphalian peace will, if it is to succeed, need to be imposed over the objections of one of the two major political parties. That, too, is an obstacle not easily removed, but like the Obama strategy itself, it will last only so long as it is seen as electorally successful.

The Time We Are Given

‘I wish it need not have happened in my time,’ said Frodo.

‘So do I,’ said Gandalf, ‘and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.’

Many Christians today would doubtless rather live in less turbulent and trying times for the faith. For the moment, the number of young American atheists and agnostics is growing, and they are aggressive with the zeal of the new convert in preaching their creed and seeking to establish it in the law and the culture. It is unsurprising, though still deeply sad, that gay people disproportionately belong to their ranks, exacerbating our cultural divide in ways that even America’s epic battles over race never had to bridge. This is particularly difficult for gay Christians (especially those who choose a celibate life), who may find themselves doubly isolated.

But Christians have faced, and continue to face to this day around the world, far worse fates for their faith than yet exist in America. If we are to keep this country that way for our children, we can best do so by standing openly and forthrightly for our faith; by treating all our neighbors with individual love and respect; by seeking common ground; and by having hope, even in the face of rational counsels of despair. We can only do our best to see to it that the lights of faith, hope, charity, reason, family, and liberty will endure.

"On Flag Day, Remember Fort McHenry’s Lost Storm Flag","During the Battle of Baltimore on September 13 and 14, 1814, heavy thunderstorms over Fort McHenry prevented the flying of the flag we know today as the Star Spangled Banner. At 30 by 42 feet, it was so massive that, if waterlogged, it could weigh several hundred pounds and snap the flagpole. So instead, a smaller “storm flag” (17 by 25 feet) was flown during the furious battle.

After the British withdrew and the clash ended, American Maj. George Armistead had the storm flag lowered and the “great garrison flag” hoisted over the fort. The latter was the flag Francis Scott Key is presumed to have seen “by the dawn’s early light,” from a ship in Baltimore Harbor, and which inspired him to pen the words to our national anthem.

What happened to the actual flag that flew over the fort during the Battle of Baltimore, which endured the heavy bombardment? According to the Smithsonian’s Museum of American History, which houses the Star Spangled Banner, “the whereabouts of the storm flag are not known.”

It’s intriguing to consider the lost artifact of the storm flag. This would have been the flag that absorbed smoke and artillery hits during the actual battle. It would have been the flag battered and torn. It took the brunt of the battle, then was duly dispatched like a discharged soldier. It seems a bit like the fresh and dry garrison flag garnered all of the glory.

It’s as though the storm flag and great garrison flag represent two aspects of America: its struggles and its glory. The American flag as a symbol is weathering many political assaults and slights these days. Which makes Flag Day—June 14—a good time to reflect on its symbolism as a storm flag.

Old Glory and the Lone Individual

Americans who appreciate the flag’s meaning understand in their gut that the American system was built to protect a human being’s right to peacefully pursue his own happiness without harassment or interference from others. Especially from an oppressive government. This means that so many rights, including the right to raise one’s own family, worship in one’s own way, and to think aloud freely, are at stake. Individual rights like this may seem simple, but they are hard-won, and so rare in human history, that they have to be defended with vigilance. Otherwise they’re easily lost.

They don’t understand the significance of the flag because they don’t understand that the Constitution’s checks and balances work to prevent too much power in the hands of too few people.

(Footnote on the slavery issue: The Constitution provided a not-perfect union of eighteenth-century states with a forge through which it could move towards a more perfect union. This meant the internal contradiction of slavery would inevitably have to be abolished. The document was built for that. It allowed for tempering and shaping a system that allowed ever-more people to enjoy liberty and pursue happiness. Unless they didn’t bother to understand this and decided to throw it all away.)

I doubt many millennials grasp that the Bill of Rights exists to protect them as lone individuals. Not as members of special groups, but as persons who are otherwise vulnerable to the whims of meddlesome bureaucrats or corrupt officials. The First Amendment means you don’t have to be a member of any special group to gain access to the right to speak or write or worship as you wish. It means you can choose on your own with whom to associate.

Yet this first principle of human freedom is being drowned out by identity politics, which does not recognize human beings as unique, whole individuals, but only as fragments of categorized groups based on ethnicity, “gender,” or whatever else.

So why would anyone in his right mind prefer the latter to the former? I think it’s because they don’t understand what’s at stake. You cannot appreciate what you don’t understand. Clearly, a growing number of Americans are unaware of what American freedom means, especially due to the massive decline of history and civics education over the past couple of generations. They don’t understand the significance of the flag because they don’t understand that the Constitution’s checks and balances work to prevent too much power in the hands of too few people.

A New Storm for Old Glory

In fact, there appears to be a growing trend in recent years to cultivate resentment for the American flag. For example, Charles Angeletti, a professor at Metropolitan State University in Colorado who claims America is a racist nation that doesn’t tolerate diversity of thought, requires his students to recite an “anti-Pledge of Allegiance” that goes like this:

I pledge allegiance to and wrap myself in the flag of the United States Against Anything Un-American, And to the Republicans for which it stands, two nations, under Jesus, rich against poor, with curtailed liberty and justice for all except blacks, homosexuals, women who want abortions, Communists, welfare queens, treehuggers, feminazis, illegal immigrants, children of illegal immigrants, and you, if you don’t watch your step.

Along those same lines, the student council at the University of California at Irvine voted in March to ban the American flag in the student union. They claimed that “freedom of speech, in a space that aims to be as inclusive as possible, can be interpreted as hate speech.” Although that vote was overturned, it indicates a trend of hostility towards the American flag, an antagonism which seems to have been cultivated—along with ignorance—on college campuses.

In addition, President Obama has been known to express a distaste for wearing a flag lapel pin, and has expressed ambivalence at best about the flag. So it goes. But there’s another flag he and the PC crowd seem to like just fine.

Is Rainbow Flag a Passing Fad, or Challenger to Old Glory?

You are probably well aware of the rainbow flag as a symbol used by the LGBT lobby since it was first introduced in the 1970s. It’s now a staple on college campuses and for lots of businesses eager to prove their allegiance to the LGBT agenda. Some American embassies have even flown it, including the ones in Tel Aviv and Madrid. Of course, it’s often flown in lieu of the American flag in front of many homes and businesses, large and small.

One might cautiously joke whether this means the American flag is supposed to be ‘transitioning’ into something ‘opposite’ for which it stands?

In fact, just the other day, while driving through downtown Washington DC, I saw rainbow flags prominently displayed at the Marriott Hotel as well as at the TD Bank on Fifteenth and P streets, NW. So it’s out there a lot. I expect you’ll see many more of them very soon—especially during the torchlight parading that’ll happen after Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, et al., rule against marriage as a male-female institution.

But how familiar are you with “New Glory?” That’s the name of a newer version of the rainbow flag that’s been popping up more these days. It’s sometimes referred to as the “gay American flag.” It’s a rainbow-spangled version of stars and stripes, in which the canton of the 50 stars on the blue field is placed in the same quadrant as Old Glory’s.

It will be interesting to see how this particular LGBT rainbow flag evolves, especially after the Supreme Court does its thing with marriage. Old Glory is sometimes interspersed and waved along with the rainbow flag at gay pride events, so one might cautiously joke in today’s confusing gender and political climates whether this means that the American flag is supposed to be “transitioning” into something “opposite” for which it stands?

The Rainbow Flag of ‘Peace’?

The symbolism of flags doesn’t necessarily translate from one flag to another, even when the colors, symbols, and even the placements thereof look the same. For example, the LGBT rainbow flag claims to stand primarily for the idea of diversity. But historically, the rainbow colors have also stood as a utopian peace flag, and was adopted by pacifists who rallied for world peace during and after World War I. It seemed to have gone dormant for a while, then was resurrected as a peace flag for anti-nuclear rallies, particularly in Europe, starting in 1961.

Throughout history without exception, utopian movements have always depended upon coercion to see through their goals.

So it wouldn’t surprise me if there was some intended convergence somewhere in here. Pacifists—especially those of the Cold War era of the 1960s—have always tended to rally for a coercive peace in which the missions of the more collectivist-minded imperialist party (such as the Soviet Union) is the ultimate victor over the individualist-principled power (such as the USA), which always gets branded as the “imperialist” bad guy.

In like manner, the LGBT movement calls for a coerced tolerance, a coerced universal celebration of its vision. Both endorse censorship in the name of “peace” or “tolerance.” Both movements are utopian in nature and vision. Throughout history without exception, utopian movements have always depended upon coercion to see through their goals.

Since the Obama administration has set out to promote the LGBT agenda globally, and even embedded this goal in the new National Security Strategy, we might wonder if we’ll see the LGBT rainbow flag recycled at some point as a symbol of peace, albeit a coercive “peace.”

With this in mind, I think it’s interesting to compare utopian feminist Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s (d. 1935) pacifist poem “The Flag of Peace,” to the utopianism and intended globalism represented in the LGBT rainbow flag. The last four lines read as follows:

When all our flags shall blend in one,

And all our wars shall cease,

‘Neath the new flag, the true flag,

The rainbow flag of peace.

Sadly, there is no room for individual rights in such utopian visions. Neither is there room in them for the American flag, or any other symbol of the rights of human beings as individuals. Utopian visions are always collectivist in nature and coercive. They cannot abide any resistance, either active or passive.

Remember the Storm Flag

The pledge of allegiance doesn’t contain a reminder that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance. But it’s a hard truth we should never forget. It’s a struggle represented by the flag itself, especially symbolized by the lost Storm Flag that flew during the Battle of Baltimore. The First Amendment is being bombarded by deceits and the cultivation of ignorance, especially with laws that are using guise of “hate speech” as an excuse to police speech.

So Flag Day is a time to think about ways to rekindle the awe in others of living under a system that aims to protect the rights of human beings as purposeful individuals, rather than as obedient cogs in some all-powerful collective. More people need to discover that freedom is not merely an American ideal, but a universal and deeply human yearning.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/06/13/on-flag-day-remember-fort-mchenrys-lost-storm-flag/,2015-06-13
15 Reasons ‘Marriage Equality’ Is About Neither,"Same-sex marriage is a notion that contains within itself the seeds of its own destruction. I doubt many have thought this through, with the ironic exception of the elites who have been pushing the agenda the hardest.

Most people are weary of it all and going along to get along, especially since dissent has become such a socially expensive proposition, almost overnight. That in itself should deeply concern anyone who values freedom of expression.

Sure, true believers scattered across the land really do think the entire project ends with allowing same-sex couples to marry. Most persist in the blind faith that a federal ban on the standard definition of marriage will have no negative effect on family autonomy and privacy. That’s a pipe dream.

The same-sex marriage agenda is more like a magic bullet with a trajectory that will abolish civil marriage for everyone, and in doing so, will embed central planning into American life. And that, my friends, is the whole point of it. Along with Obamacare, net neutrality, and Common Core, genderless marriage is a blueprint for regulating life, particularly family life.

The Rainbow’s Arc

Unintended consequences usually come about when we are ignorant or maybe lazy about a course of action. But we usually crash land after following an arc of logic, which in this case has gone largely undiscerned and unaddressed in the public square.

Americans are in a fog about how marriage equality will lead to more central planning and thought policing. This is partly because the media and Hollywood only provide slogans to regurgitate while academics and judges push politically correct speech codes to obey.

Let’s explore the fallout of that arc of faulty logic. Included below are some 15 of the gaping holes in the “marriage equality” reasoning that Americans have not thought through.

1. The Kids Are Not Alright

In March, six adult children from LGBT households filed amicus briefs opposing genderless marriage: see here, here, and here. You can read testimonials of many such children in a newly released anthology by Robert Oscar Lopez and Rivka Edelman, “Jephthah’s Daughters: Innocent Casualties in the War for Family ‘Equality.’”

Whenever a parent is missing—for whatever reason—a child feels a primal wound. In this respect, parents belong to their children more than children belong to their parents. We ought to recognize that privileges of civil marriage should ultimately exist for children, not for adults. Children have the right to know their origins and not to be treated as commodities. Same-sex parenting—which increasingly involves human trafficking, particularly with artificial reproductive technologies (see number eight)—deliberately deprives a child of a mother and/or a father. The “marriage equality” agenda requires that such children bear that burden alone and repress their primal wound in silence.

2. Love’s Got Nothing to Do with State Interest in Marriage

“Love is love” is an empty slogan when it comes to state interest in marriage. How two people feel about one another is none of the state’s business. The state’s interest is limited to the heterosexual union because that’s the only union that produces the state’s citizenry.

And it still is, whether the union happens traditionally or in a petri dish. Each and every one of us—equally and without exception—only exists through the heterosexual union. In any free and functioning society, there is a state interest in encouraging as much as possible those who sire and bear us to be responsible for raising us.

3. The Infertility Canard

Just as the state has no litmus test for feelings or motives, it has no litmus test for any heterosexual couple who do not produce children because of intent, infertility, or age. Conflating same-sex couples with childless or elderly heterosexual couples seems to be the fallacy of composition: claiming something must be true of the whole because it’s true of some part of the whole.

Sorry, but the heterosexual union, no matter how it takes place, is the only way any citizen exists, including intersex and transgender citizens. So recognizing that union without prejudice remains the only reason for state interest in marriage.

4. Same-Sex Marriage Will Settle Nothing

It’s only the starting point for a glut of philosophically related demands for state recognition and approval of many other types of relationships, including polygamy and incest. This will mark the sudden beginning of an even more sudden end for same-sex marriage, not so much because those other types of relationships prove immoral, but because they serve as exhibits for the argument that all civil marriage—including same-sex marriage—is unsustainable and discriminatory.

5. ‘Marriage Equality’ Opens the Path for ‘Unmarried Equality’

There’s a movement waiting in the wings called “unmarried equality,” which argues that all civil marriage should be abolished because it privileges married people over singles. If same-sex marriage becomes the law of the land, it will set the precedent for abolishing marriage. Far from getting the state out of the marriage business, it will invite the state to regulate all familial relationships, particularly those with children. Once the state doesn’t have to recognize your marriage, it is freer to treat your spouse and children as strangers to you.

6. Transgenderism Is a Big Part of This Package

Americans have not thought through the implications of same-sex marriage and how it is logically a big step to erasing all sex distinctions in law. If we become legally sexless, the implications are vast when it comes to how or whether the state will recognize family relationships such as mother, father, son, or daughter. There’s already a push to eliminate sex identification at birth, which could mean removing sex distinctions on birth certificates. This will seem logical because all gender identity non-discrimination laws already presume that everybody’s sex is something arbitrarily “assigned” to them at birth.

7. It’s an Open Invitation for State Licensing of Parents

If we allow the abolition of sex distinctions and civil marriage—both of which are written into the social DNA of same-sex marriage—we logically allow the state to gain greater control over deciding familial relationships. Civil marriage so far has presumed that a child born into a heterosexual union has the default right to be raised by his biological parents together. How can the presumption of maternity or paternity survive in a legal system that recognizes neither sex distinctions nor a marriage relationship?

The bellwethers are out there. MSNBC anchor Melissa Harris-Perry did a “Forward” spot for the Obama administration in which she stated that all children “belong” to communities, not families. Another friend of the Obama administration, gender legal theorist Martha Fineman, calls for state-subsidized care-giving units to replace marriage and the family.

8. Same-Sex Marriage Commodifies Children

You may think artificial reproductive technologies (ART) are fine as an avenue to obtain children for those unable to conceive. But in the context of genderless marriage, ART ramps up the potential for human trafficking. Check anonymousus.com to read testimonies of grief and loss felt by children who were conceived in this manner. Check the movies “Eggsploitation” and “Breeders” by the Center for Bioethics and Culture to hear stories of the exploitation of women in the industry. There is definitely an element of human bondage in all of this, particularly because human beings are being deliberately separated from their mothers and fathers, in a way that echoes the wounds of slavery’s separations and the search for one’s roots.

9. It Sets a Head-On Collision Course with Freedom of Religion

The handwriting is on the wall. You need only reflect on how a screaming mob managed to conjure up total surrender from Indiana Gov. Mike Pence so he would reject that state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Catholic Charities is closing its adoption services where same-sex marriage laws pressure them to reject their church’s teachings about marriage and family. Owners of businesses that serve the wedding industry are being forced to either scrap their consciences or shut their doors. Anti-discrimination lawsuits against churches that don’t perform same-sex marriages will undoubtedly increase.

10. It Sets a Collision Course for Freedom of Speech and Press

Campus speech codes. Social punishment. Firing Brendan Eich as CEO of Mozilla for discovering his thought crime of privately believing in marriage six years prior. The utter compliance of virtually every big business in America, every media outlet, every pundit who is permitted to have a voice in the public square.

11. It’s Especially On a Collision Course with Freedom of Association

I already mentioned that abolishing civil marriage, along with legal sex distinctions, puts the government in a better position to regulate familial relationships, and probably to license parents. If we think deeply about these things, it’s hard to avoid the fact that freedom of association begins with family autonomy, a place where the state is supposed to leave you alone in your most intimate relationships. It’s hard to see how freedom of association is not affected, especially when PC speech codes have everyone constantly checking their chit chat with neighbors, co-workers, and classmates. At Marquette University, staff were told that any conversation or remarks construed to be against same-sex marriage were to be reported to Human Resources, even if just inadvertently overheard.

12. Same-Sex Kills Privacy by Growing Bureaucracy

With the erosion of family autonomy practically guaranteed by the rainbow arc of same-sex marriage, private life will tend to evaporate, just as it always does in centrally planned societies. Distrust grows because people fear punishment for expressing dissenting views. The emphasis on political correctness in the name of equality, coupled with an ever-growing bureaucracy, is a perfect environment in which to percolate a surveillance society.

13. It’s Meant to Be a Global Agenda

The United States is already punishing countries and threatening to cut off aid if they don’t accept the LGBT agenda. This is especially true of developing countries, in which the whole idea is foreign to over 95 percent of the population. According to a report by Rep. Steve Stockman, corroborated by a Pentagon official, the administration held back critical intelligence from Nigeria which would have aided in locating girls kidnapped by Boko Haram. The new National Security Strategy recently released by the White House makes clear that the LGBT agenda is a global agenda. And it looks a lot like cultural imperialism of the worst kind.

14. It Promises a Monolithic Society of Conformity

In the past year or two, everyone with something to lose by opposing same-sex marriage—with the honorable exception of Eich—seems to have scuttled their principles. Five years ago, the American Psychological Association voted 157-0—that’s right, ZERO—to support genderless marriage. For an excellent assessment of what this sort of conformity means for a free society, read Brendan O’Neill’s article in Spiked, entitled “Gay Marriage: A Case Study in Conformism.” The agenda was imposed by elites, entirely due to a methodical blitzkrieg of programs and enforcement dictated from above. Same-sex marriage simply could not come about without suppressing dissent in all of our institutions.

15. Expect More Severe Punishment for Dissent

If you think the bullying of businesses, churches, and individuals who don’t get with the LGBT program now is bad, it promises to get much worse once codified. Is this really the sort of society you wish to live in? Where expressing an opinion from your heart on faith, family, marriage, relationships, love, or the very nature of reality—is routinely attacked as hate speech? Because that is exactly what you need to expect.

Justice Anthony Kennedy made it very clear in his words of the Windsor decision that any dissent on same-sex marriage was tantamount to animus. It is but a short step from presuming animus to punishing dissent.

So perhaps the biggest question hanging in the air is this: What will the authorities decide to do to dissenters?",https://thefederalist.com/2015/06/26/15-reasons-marriage-equality-is-about-neither-marriage-nor-equality/,2015-06-26
Gay People Aren’t The Only Ones Hurting,"You can’t swing a dead cat without hitting someone in pain, whether physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual. So it has always been, so it will always be. Suffering is an unavoidable fact of the human condition.

Our fellow suffering humans evoke natural compassion in us for all kinds of pain: sometimes concerning temporary teenage love, or a longsuffering battle with cancer, unfair discrimination, or the bitter loss of a child. It takes a pretty stony heart not to shudder at the suicide of 17-year-old Josh Alcorn last year, the transgender young man who threw himself in front of a moving semi to escape the anguish he felt trying to find his place in the world.

Our relationship to pain and suffering is undergoing twenty-first-century recalibration. What used to be a common understanding that we all have our burdens to bear has become a zero-sum game of victim and victimizer. God help you if you’re the latter. God help you if you aren’t LGBT. Or at least on board with the LGBT agenda.

A few troglodytes among us want gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgenders dead, and no one is saying the marginalized haven’t suffered untold torment over the years. I know my gay history, I know my Stonewall Riots, my Imitation Game, my Matthew Shepard (albeit a controversial example). The twenty-first century has taught us that lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgenders have always been and will always be with us.

We Can and Must Coexist

Good, decent people can agree to disagree. Science may or may not discover a gay gene. The debate over gender—nature vs. nurture—rages on. The existence of God as a moral force will never be proven, as matters of faith never can be, but abiding God’s word is no less eternal life-or-eternal death for believers.

The ideal of America is that we all have a place here if we respect each other and agree to basic principles.

The ideal of America is that we all have a place here if we respect each other and agree to the principles of freedom, accountability, and agency. As a nation, we were founded on the unsurpassed brilliance of a rock-paper-scissors game: no branch of government has more power than any other (at least in theory). They each check and correct each other.

Good public policy flows from the same concepts of respect and distributed power. But respect and distributed power depend for their success on the recognition that we are all in this together. Suffering varies across individuals, races, cultures, sexual and gender identities, but we’re all Americans, and we all have to give a little to make this work.

People On the Other Side Suffer, Too

The American ideal, the success of respect and distributed power, breaks down completely when only one kind of pain matters. I’m not in favor of gay marriage, but I recognize the pain opposing it causes my LGBT brothers and sisters. My faith doesn’t preclude me from participating in a gay wedding, but I recognize the no-win situation of Christian bakers, and florists, and photographers who sincerely believe they are mocking God to do so, at the risk of their eternal salvation.

Agreement, consensus, victory, or whatever you call it is simply not possible where there is such profound disagreement and such primal pain.

I have experienced the pain of good friendships dashed by differences of opinion. I have witnesed families torn apart by a transgender parent, a gay adoption, or a gay wedding. I watch good friends flail between unbridgeable worlds of the church they have cherished since birth and the announcement by a gay child that he no longer wants to be a part of that world, their world.

The truth is, we’re all hurting. The fundamental questions of who we are and what we believe are core to life itself; they undergird all faiths, families, and foundations of self. If we are on our way to new understandings of all three, so be it, but rock-paper-scissors is still the way to go.

Agreement, consensus, victory, or whatever you call it is simply not possible where there is such profound disagreement and such primal pain. Much wiser I think, to carve out a space where each of us may dwell. There will be Disney cruises specifically for gay families, there will be churches who don’t flinch from the idea that marriage is between one man and one woman, and there will be bakers, florists, and photographers everywhere in between.

Gay Activists Treat Their Opponents’ Suffering Unequally

Most Americans favor gay marriage. The Supreme Court is expected to make gay marriage the law of the land. Plenty of churches embrace LGBT clergy and parishioners. Most states allow gay adoption. The fight for equality, such as it is, is nearly over. Except for one thing.

We aren’t allowed to have our pain recognized if we’re not LGBT. Ironically, the LGBT movement inspires itself with the ideal of equality. I don’t agree gay marriage is an issue of equality. but rather a redefinition and therefore nullification of the institution of marriage itself.

But if the LGBT movement is going to march under the banner of equality, don’t we all get equal respect for wrestling with who we are and what we believe? Especially when it costs so many of us our friendships, faith communities, livelihoods, and reputations?

Same-Sex Marriage Won’t Bring Us Peace,"For decades, a growing narrative from LGBT activists has convinced a great portion of the U.S. public that cultural peace would reign if social conservatives could just get with the times on marriage.

This narrative has recently gained new legs with rulings by federal judges that say marriage laws are based in animus against people with same-sex attractions. Likewise, states and localities regularly pass so-called “non-discrimination laws” that restrict freedom of speech, religion, property ownership, and more.

Despite today’s ruling, however, social conservatives should reject this flawed thinking—not just because of their love for people with same-sex attractions, or because of the Supreme Court’s abuse of the U.S. Constitution, but to protect the American values of free speech and religious liberty.

Indeed, a simple look at the last 10 years of same-sex “marriage” laws in Canada and other nations shows that rather than bring a new utopia to America, changing the legal definition of marriage would lead to further restrictions of religious liberty, undermine parental rights, and lead to worse formative years for children.

Repressing Free Speech and Religious Practice

In Canada, redefining marriage has led straight to the persecution of Christians. Just a decade ago, Canada made same-sex marriage legal, leading to fines for a Catholic-owned Knights of Columbus hall for refusing to host a homosexual wedding reception. Likewise, in 2005, Calgary Bishop Fred Henry was called before a Human Rights Tribunal for writing a public letter defending Catholic doctrine on marriage. The complaint was withdrawn, but the message was clear: Dissent is not tolerable under the new regime.

Quebec now requires an ethics and religious culture course including the ‘equality of all families’ to be taught in private schools, public schools, and home-schooled curricula.

In America, religious freedom includes religious expression, but not so in Canada, it appears. A Catholic church at which two cohabiting homosexual men were altar servers came to the attention of the local bishop due to a letter signed by 12 parishioners.

When Bishop Nicola de Angelis went to the priest, citing Catholic doctrine, one of the servers launched a human-rights case. The case sought $25,000 from the bishop and $20,000 from each of the 12 parishioners who signed the letter. It was also dropped, but not until the bishop, like Henry, had spent considerable money in his legal defense.

Canada was one of the first nations to legally redefine marriage, but other nations are seeing similar consequences of trying to undermine what God has created. Mayors in France have been told they could not refuse to preside over same-sex ceremonies and a British marriage registrar was denied freedom for her religious beliefs, though just months earlier a demoted government employee’s right to criticize marriage redefinition was protected by courts. Of course, the same thing has already been happening in North Carolina, where civil magistrates whose consciences prevent them from performing gay marriage ceremonies must quit their job or face fines.

One prominent way the state eliminates dissenting voices on marriage is to force the teaching of gender education and so-called “equality of all families.” In Canada, this was first done by not allowing parents to withdraw children from these kinds of classes. Such efforts have graduated to where the province of Quebec now requires an ethics and religious culture course including the “equality of all families” to be taught in private schools, public schools, and home-schooled curricula.

It took a court battle for parents and private schools to gain even a modicum of freedom. Withdrawal by parents was refused at the highest court, but a recent Supreme Court decision has since allowed a Catholic school to present its centuries-old teachings on the material. In Ontario, the government passed a law mandating all schools make room for gay-straight alliance clubs, even at private schools.

In Spain, the terms “mother” and “father” were removed from birth certificates in 2006—in order to not harm the feelings of several hundred same-sex couples getting “married” at that time—and in 2012 three different political parties targeted a bishop for alleged “homophobia” for discussing Catholic doctrine on same-sex relationships.

America Isn’t Far Behind

In America, freedom is considered sacrosanct. However, it is scary to see how similar some of this country’s laws to the ones described above. For example, religious liberty, freedom of speech, and property rights have been torched in New Mexico, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, and elsewhere as “non-discrimination” laws provide state-sanctioned discrimination against supporters of real marriage.

In Washington DC, religiously affiliated education institutions are now forced to allow gay advocacy groups to use their facilities.

In 2012, New Jersey judge Solomon A. Metzger ruled against a Christian retreat house associated with the United Methodist Church that refused to allow a same-sex civil union ceremony on its premises. Just a few months ago, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed sacked fire chief Kelvin Cochran, an African-American Baptist church deacon, for expressing his personal religious beliefs on marriage in a Bible study publication.

In Washington DC, religiously affiliated education institutions are now forced to allow gay advocacy groups to use their facilities, and parents have been disallowed from helping their children who feel unwanted sexual attractions in California and New Jersey.

Even the federal government is not innocent of wrongdoing here. Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder told state attorneys general they can ignore state laws about marriage (in violation of their oaths of office), and President Obama has decided support for natural marriage is reason to discriminate against religious organizations when handing out federal grants. His administration is also attempting to punish a Navy chaplain for expressing his faith. With the Supreme Court’s 5-4 decision today, one can only imagine what is coming next, although Canada, Britain, and elsewhere offer disturbing prospects.

How Did We Get Here?

The chief blame for this state of affairs falls not with unelected judges, the impressive public relations campaign of LGBT activists, or even politicians. It really boils down to the failure of our religious leaders to speak the beautiful Christian truth about love and sexuality. Christian pulpits have been silent on these matters for 50 years while the dogma of sexual liberation has been relentlessly preached from every screen, book, and newspaper.

The solution is to do what we should have done in the first place: Preach the truth with love and courage.

While that battle will be more difficult today—for example, my organization, LifeSiteNews, has been threatened with a lawsuit for using male pronouns when referring for a transgender male, and a lawsuit for accurately reporting what the LGBT ideology means for children in Canada—such is the mantle of responsibility we must face.

Can We Preserve Liberty?

Many assume the marriage fight is lost in America and the Western world. That may be true. Regardless, however, that is another battle: Making sure the public, politicians, media, and LGBT activists understand that opposition to same-sex relationships is not akin to racism and other hate-based beliefs. In fact, because same-sex relationships hurt everyone involved, marriage supporters have a duty to oppose inverted relationships out of love and compassion.

Despite being perhaps 4 percent of the U.S. population, the LGBT community sees devastating levels of HIV/AIDS, depression, anal cancer, suicide, shorter lifespans, and other ailments. Again, it is up to Christians, and especially our pastors, to energize society with the beautiful love of our faith. We never should have given up talking about sex, and we must start doing so anew.

As former Canadian LGBT leader Gens Hellquist said in 2006, “I am tired of watching my community die” of diseases endemic to the LGBT community. A Catholic with a master’s degree in psychology who visited a ward for HIV/AIDS patients in India, he saw it was clear that only monogamous, marital relationships are healthy for human beings.

If we stand up for what is right, just, and good, even if our ideological opponents don’t agree with us, at least they will have to concede that we are coming at it from an altruistic perspective based in objective truth.

The Supreme Court has now ruled on gay marriage. They have proved zealous in their protection of a particular view of liberty. I can only pray that they will now prove equally zealous in protecting the religious liberty that will likely be severely endangered in consequence. As I looked for glimmers of hope in the majority opinion, this passage stood out to me:

“Finally, it must be emphasized that religions, and those who adhere to religious doctrines, may continue to advocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by divine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be condoned. The First Amendment ensures that religious organizations and persons are given proper protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths, and to their own deep aspirations to continue the family structure they have long revered. The same is true of those who oppose same-sex marriage for other reasons.”

As I read the majority opinion, it seemed that Justice Kennedy veered away from his earlier practice of describing opposition to gay marriage as some kind of pure product of irrationality and hatred. Though it didn’t change the result, I think this opinion accorded more respect to those who wish to preserve the traditional (and extraordinarily predominant) male-female view of marriage.

I also take some solace in the fact that the opinion was 5-4 with the chief justice in dissent. He has been raked over the coals as some kind of fake conservative. Whatever one might say about him, he took his stand on maybe the biggest decision since Roe v. Wade. He flatly stated something that has all have needed to hear during the last decade: “And a State’s decision to maintain the meaning of marriage that has persisted in every culture throughout human history can hardly be called irrational.”

The war over gay marriage appears to have been won. What remains is to see how far the consequences extend. I hope that Christian institutions will retain their convictions and that they will be permitted to continue to participate on an equal footing in American society. Liberal nostrums about the value of dissent are likely to be much tested in coming years.

It is a happy coincidence that the SCOTUS ruling on gay marriage comes on the heels of a hysterical outburst on the Left against displays of the Confederate flag and commemorations of the Confederacy across the country. What began Monday with the proposed removal of the flag from the capitol grounds in Columbia, South Carolina, has quickly morphed into a general outcry of depictions of the flag anywhere—even in video games about the Battle of Gettysburg—and a general call by liberals for eradicating or renaming Confederate memorials, statues, street names, school names, and other reminders of the suddenly-hated Confederacy.

The gay marriage debate is not about gay marriage any more than the Confederate flag debate is about racism.

Two weeks ago, the college students now protesting statues of Jefferson Davis on campuses across the south likely had no idea who the man was. But now, suddenly, an offensive statue is of utmost concern. Likewise, this week the dean of the National Cathedral in Washington DC, announced the removal of stained -lass windows honoring the lives and legacies of Confederate generals Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee. Both windows display the image of the Confederate battle flag and hence are anathema to the dean and all decent people. Yet by the dean’s own admission he only learned of the offensive windows’ existence a few days ago. The windows have been there since 1953.

One could not ask for a better exposition of the motivations of Left than this urge to destroy Confederate symbols. It was not enough to remove the Confederate flag from the capitol grounds, just as it is no doubt no longer acceptable to hold the view that, yes, the Civil War was about slavery but it was also about a great many other things, and that we should preserve Confederate memorials not only to learn about history but to honor the valor and sacrifice of many thousands of southerners who died in battle. So much for all of that.

It is not hard to see where this is going. The gay marriage debate is not about gay marriage any more than the Confederate flag debate is about racism. It is about free speech. The court’s ruling on gay marriage announces that in due course the First Amendment is to be sacrificed on the altar of the Fourteenth Amendment. Prior to this ruling, bakers and wedding photographers had already suffered fines and the threat of imprisonment for refusing to serve gay customers. Brendan Eich was among the first high-profile CEOs fired for his views on gay marriage, but he will not be the last. Eventually, churches and religious nonprofits will have their tax status threatened if they do not accommodate the new consensus on gay marriage.

It is not enough for the Left to live and let live. You must change your mind.

It is not enough for the Left to live and let live. You must change your mind. You must not hold disfavored views. You must be the right sort of person. If you’re not, you will be muzzled.

A few years back, the late Cardinal George of the Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago, who died in April, said this: “I expect to die in bed, my successor will die in prison and his successor will die a martyr in the public square. His successor will pick up the shards of a ruined society and slowly help rebuild civilization, as the Church has done so often in human history.”

The arrival of gay marriage is remarkable in the United States for a number of reasons. It has come faster than anyone, even many of its proponents, expected thanks to a complete and total acceptance of the moral imperative of this cause by our cultural and political elite; it has come without a full working over of the consequences of same sex unions in the context of how they impact freedom of speech, religion, and association; and it has come largely, and disappointingly, through unrepresentative and meandering rulings of the courts. This last one reached its apex with Anthony Kennedy’s bizarre “due process + equal protection = I get what I want” ruling from the Supreme Court.

On an issue that is this divisive, and takes on this much importance, it is essential that a Supreme Court decision offer a serious legal reasoning of why our constitutional understanding of liberty includes the right to marry who you wish, and why there is no compelling interest for government to prevent such unions. It is particularly important that this reasoning be strong and well-defended given that wide pluralities of Americans, even as they support gay marriage, thought the court should not declare it as a constitutional right.

Unfortunately, Kennedy wrote no such thing, instead offering little more than a mushy love letter to the idea of gay marriage. As Peter Lawler notes, his decision includes such anti-libertarian lines as “Marriage responds to the universal fear that a lonely person might call out only to find no one there”. The accurate word for this is “piffle”, an “I’ve fallen and I can’t get up” justification for same sex unions. Many legal minds, conservative and libertarian alike, are expressing the view today of “good result, terrible reasoning”, and they are right. It would have been much better if Justice Kennedy had just quoted from the entirety of Ilya Shapiro’s Obergefell v. Hodges amicus brief, and written at the end: “This!”

The due process argument for gay marriage has always struck me as very weak, much weaker than the equal protection argument, a position Ilya Somin shares, and the weakness of the former is highlighted repeatedly in Justice Thomas’s critique. But of course those who have strongly advocated for the institution of gay marriage by any means necessary care little how the court arrived at the decision, so long as it was the right decision.

The problem with gay marriage is not gay marriage. People of the same sex getting married will not destroy America. But it will impact America in serious ways that have ramifications for people well outside the scope of these unions – and not just the baker, photographer, florist or gazebo owner who have been highlighted to this point as the victims of overly litigious bureaucrats seeking bigots to destroy. The consequences of this decision will most rapidly be felt by religious schools and non-profits, as those who once fought for civil liberties for all will turn on those whose liberties they find to be inconvenient. Already the ACLU has announced they will no longer defend federal religious freedom laws they once fought for vociferously, because they now believe the freedom to practice one’s religion amounts to nothing more than a freedom to discriminate.

In such context, there is a very pressing need for all who believe in civil and religious liberty, despite their disagreements about marriage, to unite against the civil liberty hypocrites and the cultural and corporate elite in defense of our First Amendment freedoms. Gay marriage does not require the use and abuse of government power to trample our right to speak, associate, and practice our religion, but the aims of the secular left and the victim-hunting social justice warriors do require such overreach. These rights are essential. They are what makes us America. And they deserve defending by all who believe in the freedom to think, associate, speak, and believe.

The Supreme Court decision on marriage opens up two new fronts of conflict and confusion. Its lack of clarity almost guarantees that problems Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Thomas identify will emerge as new centers of conflict. Furthermore these new fights will almost certainly advance causes less widely supported than is the cause of same-sex marriage.

There are now no limiting principles to the establishment of new legal relationships and rights across a wide range of behaviors.

First, as Roberts warns, there are now no limiting principles to the establishment of new legal relationships and rights across a wide range of behaviors. He specifically notes polygamy as the next opportunity. If God and tradition no longer define anything, the Constitution is what five lawyers say it is, and man now places self-will ahead of obedience to any deity except ego, what are the limits in this ruling and how are we going to define them?

Second, the majority’s one-paragraph reference to religious liberty is either intentionally dishonest or a specific invitation to resume the fight on the front of religious freedom. It is almost certainly a deliberate and elitist lie thrown in as a shallow sop to the vast majority of Americans who believe this country was founded on the principle of worshipping God and having religious freedom. We can, however, test the majority’s commitment to religious liberty. If religious liberty means anything, it can’t just be the ability to speak, advocate, or “teach.” It has also to involve the opportunity to live out one’s religion, “the free exercise thereof,” as the First Amendment puts it. The very essence of a religion is the ability to define itself as separate from other ways of life (a recurring theme in both the Old and New Testaments).

To take one example, the Catholic Church should immediately file to reopen its adoption centers and other social-service institutions in Massachusetts and DC to test the sincerity of the Supreme Court’s majority. I suspect we will discover how deeply today’s majority is lying. But wouldn’t it be amazing if it actually upheld religious liberty in action as well as words?

No one should think today’s ruling ends anything. It just shifts the field of conflict.

If five judges on the Supreme Court have pronounced, in a breathtaking presumption of power, that all 50 states must redefine marriage, what does that mean for the countless institutions within our civil society—churches and synagogues, charities and adoption agencies, counseling services and religiously affiliated schools—that are made up of American citizens who believe marriage is the union of one man and one woman?

The right to form and to follow one’s religious beliefs is the bedrock of human dignity and liberty that must be forcefully defended from undue government interference.

Will federal agencies follow the heavy-handed approach taken by the present majority of Supreme Court justices—say, by revoking the non-profit, tax-exempt status of faith-based schools that continue to operate on the basis of their religious beliefs about marriage? Nowhere in the majority’s 28-page opinion will you find a reliable answer to these questions. In his dissent, Chief Justice John Roberts explains why.

“Federal courts are blunt instruments when it comes to creating rights,” Roberts writes, because “they do not have the flexibility of legislatures to address concerns of parties not before the court or to anticipate problems that may arise from the exercise of a new right.”

It’s true that Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority, acknowledges—as if in passing—that “The First Amendment ensures that religious organizations and persons are given proper protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths,” including their conviction that marriage is the union between one man and one woman.

But this may prove to be little consolation for those who have conscientious objections to the redefinition of marriage. For the remainder of Kennedy’s opinion, like much of today’s jurisprudence, is based on the pretension that the role of judges is not merely to resolve cases and controversies in the law, but to apply their own “reasoned judgment” to define for each successive generation the “nature of injustice” and divine the “meaning” of liberty.

That’s why I recently introduced a bill, with Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) in the House, called “The First Amendment Defense Act” that would prevent any agency from denying a federal tax exemption, grant, contract, accreditation, license, or certification to an individual or institution for acting on their religious belief that marriage is a union between one man and one woman.

In light of today’s Supreme Court decision, Congress must move swiftly to pass “The First Amendment Defense Act” and clarify in federal law what five justices left ambiguous in their legal opinion: that the right to form and to follow one’s religious beliefs is the bedrock of human dignity and liberty that must be forcefully defended from undue government interference.

Lost in all the celebration about marriage equality are the problems to come from how this right was sought and realized. By bypassing the state and federal structure of our nation, the current winners have exposed us all to tyranny of the majority. That might seem a ridiculous statement now, but the types of people who put policy before principles often naively assume that their policies will always be most popular. They do not anticipate a future when legal shortcuts will be used against them.

The types of people who put policy before principles often naively assume that their policies will always be most popular.

Only when they find themselves on the wrong side of popular dictates will they realize that this Supreme Court will not offer protection. In the space of a day, Chief Justice Roberts went from devoting an entire section of an opinion to rewrite “inartful” drafting by Congress to declaring “[b]ut this Court is not a legislature.” I don’t know which concerns me more: his willingness to draft legislation or the fact that he doesn’t seem aware of his inconsistent reasoning. In stark contrast, I can read a mere half dozen cases from Justice Thomas and figure out how he would likely rule. He applies legal principles. To begin to guess how the chief might rule, I would have to know him well enough to anticipate his personal quirks and preferences.

We can continue to assume, as many court watchers did after his 2012 “it’s a tax, not a mandate” opinion, that the chief justice is playing some long jurisprudential strategy. Perhaps, although the purpose is so well concealed that I suspect either we imagine it or he is over-engineering it. Either way, we can no longer rest on hope and half measures. If we would preserve the wisdom of the U.S. Constitution, we need to fortify it. Congress does as it pleases, using muddy procedures and language to win public favor while the Supreme Court plays along, bowing to the demands of the loudest chorus. We only have one avenue of recourse left.

Professor Randy E. Barnett outlined this course in 2009 when the Supreme Court’s shrinking from its duty was still mostly confined to Commerce Clause jurisprudence. (The linked version of the Bill of Federalism is outdated. The current version appears in the second edition of Barnett’s “Restoring the Lost Constitution.”) It seemed drastic then. It is a last refuge now.

It takes two-thirds, or 33, of the state legislatures to call a constitutional convention. This would not be a partisan initiative, although Republicans are more likely to be concerned about constitutional protections at this time. By my count, Republicans control 32 state legislatures with four split bodies. The time for amending the constitution by convention has probably never been so possible, or so pressing.

As a longtime defender of traditional marriage, I’m supposed to take a day of mourning before moving forward. Actually, though, I’m feeling fairly chipper after hearing the ruling. To be clear, the decision was a complete travesty. We’ve just seen America’s cultural 1 percent impose its understanding of marriage unilaterally on a nation that is still deeply divided on this important question. The result will not be “inclusion,” but rather the dictatorial exclusion of a major part of our cultural and legal heritage, along with the cherished beliefs and values of a substantial portion of our citizenry, from the democratic process. Clearly, this is nothing to celebrate.

It’s actually something of a blessing that the democratic illegitimacy of the Obergefell decision is so painfully obvious.

But this train wreck has been foreseeable for long, long time now. And even though state-level initiatives are actually the appropriate means of settling such matters, the reality is that that game was also effectively rigged according to Progressive assumptions. Any victory for same-sex marriage is viewed as settled law. Defeat is taken as an “ask again later.” What good can be accomplished under such conditions, through any branch of government?

What we needed was a new chapter. This decision could be that page-turning, and in that sense it’s actually something of a blessing that the democratic illegitimacy of the Obergefell decision is so painfully obvious. We’ve just watched the Left triumph in the most important two battles of its recent history, but despite that, it’s exhausted, demoralized, and increasingly throwing itself into screwball “causes” like railing against the Confederate flag. If conservatives could show some leadership and vision at this precarious moment, the next chapter might be more upbeat than the one we’ve just finished.

The Supreme Court seems to hate children. First, in Roe v. Wade, it took away a child’s right to life in favor of the convenience of an adult. Now, it has taken away a child’s right to a biological mother and father, favoring fleeting sentimentality over a child’s established, inherent needs. With this ruling, the Supreme Court has said children don’t need their mom and dad. The ephemeral interests of adults are more important than the rights of children. We have entered a brave new world.

Those who value the traditional family and care about children must work to protect them by strengthening families.

So, where do we go from here? The only place we can go—back home. We fight for marital restoration and family renewal. Those who value the traditional family and care about children must work to protect them by strengthening families. This will involve personal reformation as husbands and wives work at maintaining healthy, stable, and committed relationships, thereby reducing the number of divorces that plague our society. It will require parents being more responsible for their children’s education and development instead of turning them over to the state. And it will involve compassionate individuals banding together at the local level to meet the needs of children who will inevitably suffer the consequences of being intentionally and permanently denied an intimate and meaningful relationship with their father or mother—a cruelty that must be exposed for the abusive neglect it is.

While it is no one’s business who loves another person or what they do in the bedroom, it is the business of society to protect the weakest among us—children. When parents and the government purposely deprive children of their most basic rights, it’s the responsibility of every loving and compassionate human being to fight for them, politically and legally, and to care for them in real, personal, and life-changing ways.

Change is hard no matter whether it’s perceived as positive or negative. Depending on where they are on the path to accepting a change, people manage it differently. A change people perceive as negative can shift people through immobilization, denial, anger, bargaining, depression, testing, and acceptance.

For folks who see the Supreme Court’s gay marriage law change as positive—and it appears a majority of Americans embrace it—change still has its phases, and folks who are positive today can shift into a negative mindset and back again.

Why would any of this matter? Well, the dramatic shift this country just undertook to go from considering gay marriage a fringe issue to the expected outcome Friday is unprecedented. Cultural shifts that change the very way we think about a core institution like marriage do not come around very often. Chief Justice Roberts’s dissent is worth reading again to understand just how large of a shift this is for society.

To that point, we are a country of people, and people are typically not change-agent experts. Change is hard even if it’s for a better outcome. While today’s outcome is a blessing for those who want to see the institution of marriage extended to loving gay couples, those who see it negatively aren’t thinking of the potential happy couples. They are thinking of the warnings in Robert’s, Scalia, and Thomas’s dissent about what this means for religious freedom, the ability to have a different belief on this topic and still be allowed in the public square, and the inevitable witch-hunts to come from activists who wield #lovewins as a cudgel, not a creed.

An outrage-thirsty media can now in all 50 states mock small business owners and other folks still processing what this means for a belief that was held without question for hundreds of years. More change is coming, and the question is, how fast can people change without destroying something that was meant to be preserved? I suspect many are immobilized by the fear that what they hold dear cannot withstand the march of time. Others happy that their close gay and lesbian friends can marry might waver, wishing this change could have happened with surgical precision that would have enabled a more rapid adoption in everyone’s hearts. It’s time to think about what must be saved and protected while accepting that change has come.

I see two problems with the pro-gay marriage argument, and the SCOTUS ruling gives us a chance to see if and how they will play out in practice. The first problem is that, over the past half-century, virtually every one of the Left’s opinions and activist efforts regarding marriage and family have proven to be disastrous for both marriages and families. Loosening welfare standards, glorifying single parenthood, a near-ubiquitous culture of contraception, abortion-on-demand—all of these things have been the Left’s hobby-horses and all of them have had, overall, a profoundly negative impact upon the building block of our society, the family unit.

Virtually every one of the Left’s opinions and activist efforts regarding marriage and family have proven to be disastrous for both marriages and families.

Progressives do not have the courage to admit that they were wrong in the past or that they may be wrong again, which is why they’ve been so enthusiastic about gay marriage over the past decade. This is not to say that gay marriage will have the same effect on the family as the Left’s other efforts. But it is to say that progressives have been wrong in just about every way they can be regarding marriage itself, and that it is a distinctly likely possibility that the gay marriage regime will have a similar effect, and that the family will suffer for it.

The second problem is not so much speculative as reflective: it is all but certain that, with the legalization of gay marriage, the by-now-regular assault on religious liberties will continue, probably at a faster rate. Lawsuits against bakers, wedding chapels, photographers and other service providers will likely explode, and the effort will almost certainly grow to encompass religious institutions themselves: Catholic churches, conservative Protestant denominations, the temples of Orthodox Judaism (surely they’ll leave Islam alone out of a sense of politically correct propriety). This decision is being hailed as a great victory for freedom, but—as is obvious to anyone who has been paying attention—the court’s decision yesterday will almost surely result in a net loss of American liberty, and overall America will be worse off for it.

Just because today’s opinion was expected by nearly everyone doesn’t make it any less momentous. In sometimes-soaring rhetoric Kennedy explains that the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of both substantive liberty and equality means there is no further valid reason to deny this particular institution, the benefit of these particular laws, to gay and lesbian couples. Okay, fair enough: there’s a constitutional right for gay and lesbian couples to get marriage licenses—at least so long as everyone else gets them. (We’ll set aside the question of why the government is involved in marriage in the first place for a later time.)

What about people who disagree, in good faith, with no ill intent towards gay people?

But where do we go from here? What about people who disagree, in good faith, with no ill intent towards gay people? Will ministers, to the extent they play a dual role in ratifying marriage licenses, have to officiate big gay weddings? Will bakers and photographers have to work them? What about employment-discrimination protections based on sexual orientation—most states lack them, but are they now required? And what about tax-exempt status for religious schools, the issue that came up during oral argument?

It’s unclear to be honest—much depends on whether Anthony Kennedy remains on the court to answer these thorny questions in his own hand-waving way—but all of these examples, including marriage licensing itself, show the folly inherent in government insinuation in places into the sea of liberty upon which we’re supposed to sail our ship of life. (Justice Kennedy, you can use that one next time; no need even to cite me.)

If government didn’t get involved in regulating private relationships between consenting adults—whether sexual, economic, political, athletic, educational, or anything else—we wouldn’t be in that second-best world of adjudicating competing rights claims. If we maintained that broad public non-governmental sphere, as distinct from both the private home and state action, then we could let a thousand flowers bloom and each person would be free to choose a little platoon with which to associate.

But the extent to which we live in that world is decreasing at a horrendous pace, and so we’re forced to fight for carve-outs of liberty amidst the sea of mandates, regulations, and other authoritarian “nudges.”

In any event, good for the court today—and I echo Justice Kennedy’s hope that both sides will now respect each other’s liberties and the rule of law. But I stand ready to defend anybody’s right to offend or otherwise live his or her life (or run his or her business) in ways I might not approve.

As an unabashed supporter of marriage equality, I am both delighted by the outcome in Obergefell v. Hodges and baffled by the unsound legal reasoning the Supreme Court employed. Neither Justice Kennedy’s majority decision, nor any of the four dissents, puts forth a compelling constitutional case for or against same-sex marriage. (For more on this, the Cato Institute’s Timothy Sandefur closely articulates my views on the subject.) Nevertheless, one way or another, the LGBT movement has triumphed in the highest court in the land as well as the court of public opinion, and this libertarian is thrilled that same-sex couples can now enjoy the same special benefits that opposite-sex couples do. This is the express purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment: to protect minorities from state-sponsored discrimination.

Speaking of social tolerance, to liberals, I say this: give it a try, sometime.

Three things. First, to conservatives who oppose gay marriage, I say this: It’s over. You lost. Please, resist the urge to die on this hill. I understand the temptation to treat the Obergefell ruling as merely another battle in the culture wars—like Roe v. Wade was—but continuing to advocate against marriage equality risks permanently alienating the under-30 crowd. Millennials are more entrepreneurial and less loyal to the Democratic Party than most people think. Republicans—particularly libertarian-leaning Republicans—can reach them, but only if the party preaches both economic opportunity and social tolerance.

Speaking of social tolerance, to liberals, I say this: give it a try, sometime. The best way to convince social conservatives that gay marriage will not destroy the very fabric of society is to demonstrate to them that gay marriage is perfectly healthy and benign. In other words, don’t humiliate them, boycott their states, shun their businesses, and petition the government to compel them to violate their beliefs. Too many progressives move from accept this to accept this or die in the span of about five seconds. (An example: just a few days ago, virtually all informed commentators were in agreement about removing the Confederate flag from the South Carolina state capitol; today, Civil War-themed board games are being purged from stores to comply with the latest PC dictates.)

To my fellow libertarians, I wish only to remind them that this is as much their victory as it is anyone else’s. The Cato Institute has supported marriage equality for much longer than Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama.

Eric Teetsel



Two years to the day after ruling against the federal Defense of Marriage Act while waxing eloquent about the right of states to determine their own marriage policy, Justice Kennedy ruled that actually all fifty states are legally required to sanction same-sex marriages. The decision brings an end to the democratic processes through which proponents of same-sex marriage were swiftly gaining ground, abruptly closing one chapter in the culture wars and setting the scene for the next. Those who understand what marriage is and why it matters now turn their attention to two tasks, one of immediate importance and another that will require slow, steady work for a generation or more.

Proponents of marriage must immediately redouble our efforts to ensure robust legal protections for the expression of beliefs that don’t conform to popular dogmas, especially those of fundamentalist LGBT activists. Their illiberal agenda is clearly seen in the aggressive persecution of business owners, professors, public servants, and nuns who have the audacity to conform their behavior to their religious beliefs. Passing laws such as the recently introduced federal First Amendment Defense Act and state-level Marriage and Religious Freedom Acts is a place to start. However, none of this will be easy. Recent spasms of outrage in response to sensible state-level RFRA laws in Arizona, Indiana and Georgia prove that these activists understand that religious liberty is now the front-line in their sexual revolution.

Our long–term mission is rebuilding a cultural understanding of and appreciation for the purpose and significance of sex, marriage, and family. We, especially Christians, have for too long abdicated our responsibility to educate along these lines. The proliferation of divorce, premarital sex, cohabitation, adultery, out-of-wedlock birth, and abortion are but a few of the consequences that chipped away at the foundation of the family long before same-sex marriage became feasible. In the next generation, we must do as the Manhattan Declaration exhorts to strengthen families:

we must stop glamorizing promiscuity and infidelity and restore among our people a sense of the profound beauty, mystery, and holiness of faithful marital love. We must reform ill-advised policies that contribute to the weakening of the institution of marriage, including the discredited idea of unilateral divorce. We must work in the legal, cultural, and religious domains to instill in young people a sound understanding of what marriage is, what it requires, and why it is worth the commitment and sacrifices that faithful spouses make.

As the normalization of the LGBT ideology continues to wreak havoc on the lives of our neighbors, friends, and loved ones in the years to come, those with a clear-eyed understanding of sin and its consequences must be there pointing towards a better way with truth on our lips and love in our hearts. It will not be easy, but to borrow a phrase from the Apostle Paul, in the end we will reap a harvest, if we do not give up.

Heather Wilhelm



First, the good news: Regardless of your views on gay marriage, it’s clear that our nation’s unelected cabal of black robed overlords—ahem, sorry, the Supreme Court—contains at least one verifiable national treasure. Over the past few days, buried in mangled jurisprudence that made him want to “hide” his “head in a bag,” Justice Antonin Scalia managed to coin several enduring catchphrases, including “pure applesauce,” “interpretive jiggery-pokery,” and, my personal favorite, “ask the nearest hippie.”

I’ve long thought the government should get out of the marriage business altogether. A policy of civil unions for gay and straight couples—leaving religious marriage to churches—would go a long way towards preserving both equal rights and religious freedom in America.

That, alas, is not where we landed on Friday. Instead, the government just got bigger, more powerful, more legally capricious, and set the stage for a thicket of legal and cultural messes, the most obvious being the tax-exempt status of churches that disagree. In the wake of the decision, American Airlines, which is perhaps the second-worst airline in the country—bravo, United!—issued the following tweet:

This is great, American, except EVERY SCREEN IS THE SAME, which is not diverse, and I get the strange feeling we’re not allowed to change the channel. Also, we’re stuck in the back, middle seat, and—oh, dear heavens, what on earth is this you’ve given me? Is it supposed to be some kind of casserole?

It’s an excellent metaphor for what happens when government takes control. Big corporations don’t care about freedom; the government cares even less. The more government gets involved in our daily lives, the more micromanagement we’re going to see. It’s a losing scenario for everyone.

This, however, is where I get optimistic. In the short run, we can be gracious and happy for those who can now get married, despite the disastrous “fortune cookie” legal logic—that’s Scalia, of course—that got us here. Meanwhile, we should tirelessly defend the religious liberty of those who dissent.

But in the long run, perhaps this ruling, paired with its inevitable, messy consequences, will remind people that more government almost always equals more problems. Both sides of the political aisle need this reminder, by the way. It’s how we got into this mess in the first place.

Just ask the nearest hippie.

The Supreme Court’s ruling in favor of same-sex marriage is not surprising, but it is indeed moral and historical disaster. The Court has both created a generation’s worth of confusion about the purpose and nature of marriage and left the well-being of children subject to the sexual autonomy of adults.

As a Christian, I believe marriage is about more than just a social arrangement, but points beyond itself to the gospel of Jesus Christ (Eph. 5:32). I also believe that marriage is embedded by God in the created order in the interests of the common good. That’s why I hope we can turn back from this move toward laissez-faire sexuality. But regardless of the culture, the church’s witness stands. Marriage is not a government program and it can’t be re-engineered by government decree or by the swings of public opinion. Our quiet confidence is in the Gospel, not Gallup.

We have been here before. For over 40 years, the pro-life movement in this country has overwhelmingly modeled what compassionate, counter-cultural, and quietly confident public engagement should look like. Even in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s devastating decision in Roe v Wade, courageous public voices came forward to challenge popular opinion and advocate for human dignity, not just in rhetoric but in radical acts of mercy in their congregations and communities. Pro-life churches that don’t just preach pro-life as a political talking point but as a spiritual reality offer us who are in the aftermath of marriage confusion much to emulate.

The pro-life movement gives us an encouragement and a warning. The warning is that political victory does not equal cultural persuasion. It is possible to win the White House but lose the neighborhood. Forgetting the Gospel of the Kingdom to focus on electing the right leader is a recipe for Gospel unfaithfulness and cultural uselessness regardless of whose names are on which doors in Washington D.C.

But our encouragement is that the risen Jesus Christ is still making all things new. The pro-life movement has seen remarkable legal and social progress over the last 40 years. Though we are far from where we need to be, we ought to be thankful that we are not where we once were or could be. Let’s learn from the pro-life movement how to be convictionally kind, how to be quietly confident, how to be engaged exiles as we move onward.

"BuzzFeed’s Journalistic Struggles On Same-Sex Marriage, In GIFs","Last Friday, the Supreme Court issued a ruling declaring it had discovered a new “fundamental” right to same-sex marriage hidden deeply inside the Constitution — so deep inside that Justice Anthony Kennedy had a bit of difficulty explaining precisely where it was located or how he found it.

Nearly all major media had been more or less campaigning for marriage redefinition for the years leading up to the Obergefell ruling. Some editors and reporters at the New York Times, Washington Post and NPR admitted as much when they claimed that support of marriage as an institution based on sexual complementarity was an idea so beneath contempt that it wasn’t worthy of fair coverage.

After the ruling, any pretense of objectivity that remained largely washed away as media elites joined progressive politicians and corporations in popping open the champagne and guzzling down. The White House lit up in the colors of gay pride, and major corporations’ altered their social media presence to match. Among many other media outlets, BuzzFeed changed its social media avatars and literally marched in gay pride parades.

What was interesting about this was that the decision in favor of redefining marriage and making same-sex marriage a new Constitutional right came, if you believe any of the dissents, at the expense of rule of law, self-government, and “ominously,” as Chief Justice John Roberts put it, religious liberty.

So while progressives celebrated, tens of millions of Americans outside of newsrooms reacted with quite different emotions. The contrast was pronounced and profoundly alienating.

Dylan Byers at Politico talked to BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith about his media outlet’s stance:

For Ben Smith, the editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed, same-sex marriage is an issue which does not have sides. On Friday, he told the On Media blog that BuzzFeed’s Twitter avatar was in keeping with its standards guide: “We firmly believe that for a number of issues, including civil rights, women’s rights, anti-racism, and LGBT equality, there are not two sides.”

I will now try to respond in the BuzzFeastian fashion.

This is from the standards guide? Maybe the standards guide should define these issues a bit more. Does it consider the right to end an unborn life a “women’s rights” issue on which there are not two sides? Or what, exactly? What would be an example of a story on which there are not two sides? What does LGBT equality mean, even? It’s unclear, beyond the cheering for Obergefell that Smith justified by referring to the standards guide.

What would it even mean to say that there are not two sides on an issue that was literally just decided on a 5-4 vote? How does BuzzFeed explain to its readers what that number four represents?

New York’s highest court issued a ruling on the same issue as Obergefell in 2006. It looked at virtually the same constitutional issues as Obergefell did and rather than discovering a foundational right to same-sex marriage, it concluded that if the legislature wanted to change the law, it could, but that defining marriage as the union of husband and wife made tons of sense. Or, as the New York Times put it at the time:

New York’s highest court rejected yesterday a broad attempt by gay and lesbian couples across the state to win the right to marry under state law, saying that denying marriage to same-sex couples does not violate the State Constitution.



By a 4-2 majority, the Court of Appeals found that the State Legislature, in laws dating back nearly 100 years, intended to limit marriage to a union between a man and a woman, and that the Legislature had a rational basis for doing so…



The majority decision, written by Judge Robert S. Smith, found that limiting marriage to couples of the opposite sexes was based on legitimate societal goals, primarily the protection and welfare of children. It could well be argued, he said, that children are better off raised by a biological mother and father, rather than by a gay or lesbian couple.

Wait, what was the name of that judge?

Yep, none other than Ben Smith’s own father. As James Taranto put it at the Wall Street Journal, “Smith’s denial that another side of the question even exists demonstrates a lack of filial piety.” Indeed!

Anyway, Smith has taken a lot of heat for simply being more honest than other media outlets are about a lack of tolerance for views editors disagree with. We should appreciate his honesty.

And in that same vein, we should appreciate the interview he gave Hugh Hewitt on the topic yesterday. The transcript is here but it’s virtually incomprehensible. The transcript is accurate, it’s just that it’s very hard to follow Smith’s train of thought and he suffers from serious verbal tics.

I’m not trying to be uncharitable. I have the same tics, unfortunately. But there are dozens upon dozens of “like,” “I mean,” and “you know” and “sort of” tics and this interview should be a wake-up call to those who share this problem that we need to clean it up immediately. A sample, from Smith’s response to Hewitt’s request that he explain the controversy:

BS: I don’t really think there, I mean, I guess I don’t really think there was much of a controversy, or at least I didn’t see. There were like, I’ve been tweeting with three people today – Tim Carney and a guy named, just, I mean, but I’m not sure like three or four people make a controversy. But I think we have, we drafted and published a Standards Guide and an Ethics Guide several months ago, and I think we’ve been wrestling with something I’m sure you think about a lot, which is, although I think I probably come down somewhere a bit differently from you, which is you know, is it possible to, look, what is the tradition that used to be called kind of objective journalism, mainstream media journalism, the tradition the New York Times and the Washington Post come out of, which is the tradition I come out of? You know, how do you do that in a way that, you know, that’s honest with your readers? And I think you know, there’s always been, for a long time, been this debate both on the right and on the left saying come on, you guys, stop lying, don’t conceal your opinions. We know you have real opinions. And at the same time, of course, everyone has a set of implicit opinions about, you know, you don’t have to say, Hugh, that like you oppose racism and that you favor free speech. Those are obviously baked into your coverage, just as much as they’re baked into the New York Times’ coverage.

The audio helps a great deal, which you can access here.

Smith struggles mightily to explain BuzzFeed’s standards guide, at times downplaying its significance without fully disavowing it. Hewitt asks some questions about the religious liberty concerns raised by the Obergefell decision he celebrated, about which Smith doesn’t have strong views. He doesn’t seem to have thought through the ramifications of redefining marriage very much and displays a somewhat surprising lack of knowledge and curiosity on these issues. Hewitt points out that BuzzFeed takes a strident policy on same-sex marriage but not one on, say, Saudi Arabia’s oppression of religious minorities.

Toward the end of the interview, they discuss that Smith doesn’t believe in God.

Hewitt wonders if Smith and BuzzFeed can cover well anyone who does believe in God. Hewitt asks Smith:

Can you ever get me? And do you have serious Evangelicals on the staff of BuzzFeed with whom to engage in the conversation about going forward what these institutions are going to have happen to them as a result of the marriage decision?

Smith responds that journalists can cover people different from them, simply needing a “certain level of humility and empathy,” and, I might add, humility should include an awareness that there is more than one side to everything.

Anyway, he also says:

BS: We do have, yes, but I also think, second, that newsroom diversity is like you know, it’s really important in having people of faith and particularly religious Christians in newsroom is important, yes, and we do. And I think that’s an important perspective.



BS: I mean, you know, I think good reporters are very good at least trying to understand the people they cover, and I think we have people who have all sorts of different beliefs here, so…but that’s important.

Well there you go! BuzzFeed has “religious Christians” in the newsroom and “all sorts of different beliefs” are important. It’s so true! In a nation that is divided on the clash between sexual liberty and religious liberty, it is a great idea for a major newsroom to make sure its reporters and editors don’t all share identical views on the topic.

The mystery of whether a single person among BuzzFeed’s 1000-person staff is dissenting, much less publicly, from the BuzzFeed editorial position remains. Smith says:

@MZHemingway I don’t know most people’s faith/personal views on much. Definitely ppl who disagree on the constitutional q.



Ben Smith (@BuzzFeedBen) June 30, 2015

The one thing about claiming a wide variety of views are present in the reporting staff one oversees is that you do have to know a bit about most employee’s “faith/personal views.” After all, it’s easier to pretend there aren’t multiple sides to major issues of the day when you’re only hiring from one side.

As I noted on CNN this weekend, BuzzFeed puts a lot of resources into its LGBT coverage and it does well with that. It does less well with religious news, religious liberty news and news about the complexities of marriage and marriage law. Now that it has helped accomplish its campaign to redefine marriage, perhaps it can pour some resources into coverage of the aftermath of the change. Hiring a few dozen people with different viewpoints on the matter would be a good first step.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/06/30/buzzfeeds-journalistic-struggles-on-same-sex-marriage-in-gifs/,2015-06-30
What Gay Couples Should Do With Their Newfound Power,"In April, I wrote an opinion piece for The Federalist explaining why I, as a gay man, opposed same-sex marriage. After last week’s Supreme Court ruling, I find myself on the “wrong side of history,” but the right side of the facts—an incredibly frustrating place to be.

I write now, not to defend the traditional institution of marriage, but to encourage my brothers and sisters in the LGBT community to step up to the great responsibility that is now before them.

The beloved Uncle Ben from Marvel’s “Spider Man” put it nicely when he said, “With great power comes great responsibility.” The Supreme Court handed the gay community a tremendous power when it decreed same-sex couples have the legal right to form families. Now comes the responsibility.

Unfortunately, I fear that the gay community at large is not ready to handle this responsibility. Contrary to what is often portrayed in the media and on television shows like “Modern Family,” LGBT culture is far from “family friendly.”

Gay Culture Is Not Family-Friendly

Of course, there are some exceptions to every rule. While I will always maintain that a child should be raised by both his mother and his father, I do concede that there are loving, stable same-sex partnerships that do the best they can to raise their children. My uncle and his husband, married for nearly ten years now, are two examples of this. Their son wants for nothing (except, perhaps, a mother).

By and large, gay culture as it currently exists is an injurious environment to raise a family.

So, yes, some exceptions may exist. But by and large, gay culture as it currently exists is an injurious environment to raise a family. If gay and lesbian Americans hope to engage in the institution of marriage in a responsible way, they must drastically reform LGBT culture, or do as I have, and abandon it altogether.

The first challenge that needs to be tackled is the rejection of monogamy by the vast majority of gay men. This assertion isn’t merely some talking point from a Christian conservative outlet. The non-monogamy of gay men is a well-documented trend, and it’s no way to raise a family.

Research published in the groundbreaking book “The Male Couple” (1984) found that only 5 percent of the gay couples studied were monogamous. More recently, a Dutch study found that the average gay man in a committed relationship had roughly eight sexual partners per year beyond his boyfriend or husband. Additionally, a study by the National Institutes of Health published just a few years ago found that about half of all gay men in a stable relationship admit to sleeping with a partner outside of their relationship—with their boyfriend or husband’s approval.

The Gay Community Openly Rejects Monogamy

Indeed, the gay community has become quite vocal about rejecting monogamous relationships. Gay-rights activist and anti-bullying bully Dan Savage has coined the term “monogamish” to describe his arrangement with his husband, whereby cheating is allowed under certain circumstances. I wonder if this is what Justice Kennedy meant in his majority opinion when he said marriage represents the “highest ideals of…fidelity.”

Gay culture needs to embrace spousal fidelity to join the institution of marriage in a responsible way.

This rejection of monogamy in the gay male community shouldn’t surprise anyone with a basic understanding of human nature. In my opinion, gay men aren’t promiscuous because they are gay. They are promiscuous because they are men. Women temper the baser instincts of men. Without the moderating effects of womanhood, or an overwhelming moral code, men give in to primal urges. Perhaps that is why lesbians are twice as likely to get married as gay men, according to a study by researchers at the University of California-Los Angeles.

Gay culture—in particular, gay male culture—needs to embrace spousal fidelity to join the institution of marriage in a responsible way. But this is just the beginning. Aside from adopting monogamy, the LGBT community must also abandon the hypersexualized displays of hedonism that have become a staple of gay-pride events.

Hedonism Is No Environment for a Child

Take San Francisco, for example. In 2012, city officials decided to join the rest of the civilized world by banning public nudity. After pressure from gay-rights activists, however, the city added an exception for the gay-pride parade. Dallas officials faced similar blow-back a number of years ago when they warned organizers of gay-pride events that public displays of nudity would not be tolerated. Gay-rights activists protested, arguing that the nudity ban was unfair, and was only meant to accommodate the growing number of straight people attending the pride parade.

Gay leaders are actively protesting any attempt to cover up displays of debauchery at pride events.

It’s not that gay-community leaders are merely tolerating public nudity by a few bad apples. They are actively protesting any attempt to cover up displays of debauchery at pride events. (For an extremely NSFW but hilarious take on this problem, check out this satirical article from The Onion.)

Perhaps this is what happens when your primary self-identifying trait happens to be your sexual orientation. Even though I am gay, my sexual orientation is not the most important part of who I am. I am a Christian, an American, a conservative. My sexual orientation is important, but it’s not the most important characteristic that defines me.

But for many gay people, their sexual orientation occupies so much of their identity. They define themselves first and foremost by who they are attracted to. It’s no wonder that, when they come together to celebrate their identity, these events take on an overt sexual tone.

If gay men want to join the sacred and storied institution of marriage, they need to start acting as husbands and fathers should act. This means rejecting the self-indulgent hedonism that has tragically come to define the gay community. Embrace fidelity. Embrace modesty. Embrace your responsibilities as you take part in the most important institution in our society.

If not for yourselves, do it for your children.

Don’t Put My 5-Year-Old Girl In A Bathroom With A Transgender Boy,"In his speech accepting the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the ESPY’s, Bruce Jenner used his experience to discuss the next generation of transgenders: “Trans people deserve something vital: They deserve your respect. If you want to call me names, make jokes, doubt my intentions, go ahead, because the reality is, I can take it. But for the thousands of kids out there, coming to terms with being true to who they are, they shouldn’t have to take it.”

I agree with Jenner. No kid should be bullied anywhere, for any reason, especially not in schools. But that doesn’t mean transgender kids should be free to make other kids acquiesce to environments in which they are uncomfortable. In schools now, adults and students alike are lobbying for preferential treatment for transgender kids, but their goals or accomplishments fail to acknowledge that every student deserves equal treatment.

The Bathroom Battlefield

It’s not enough to go to school and be transgender; emboldened by the U.S. Department of Education declaration that Title IX also applies to transgender students, said students are now demanding to use the restroom of the gender with which they wish to label themselves.

For example, in March, the school board in Stafford, Virginia, allowed a fourth-grade boy to use the girls’ restroom. After parents and local lawmakers complained, the school board reversed that decision.

The Atlantic reports, “Just last month, a 16-year-old transgender student filed a lawsuit against a school board in another Virginia district over a similar policy that required the student to use an “alternative” restroom instead.” Two other families of transgender children, one a first-grader in Colorado and another high-schooler in Maine, filed lawsuits—which were upheld—requiring schools to let transgender children to use the bathroom of their choice.

Transgender Issues Are Tricky

The issue of transgenders under 18 is a sticky one, not because the feelings involved don’t exist but because they, like hormones, and other types of feelings, change often. Thank God, none of us are the adults we were when we were teenagers. In a recent, sad story in The New York Times about a transgender youth who underwent gender-reassignment surgery, the author writes: “Complicating matters, studies suggest that most young children with gender dysphoria eventually lose any desire to change sex, and may grow up to be gay, rather than transgender. Once into adolescence, however, their dysphoria is more likely to stick.”

This means school-age children are using their fluctuating feelings to dominate and even extinguish the voices of others through lawsuits and school policies.

So it’s a very real and even likely possibility that a pre-pubescent child who bullies everyone at school into seeing him as the opposite sex will one day naturally lose that desire. While his desires may go away, the discomfort he inflicted on everyone nearby will still have happened.

Another sticky issue is that many transgender people claim that status based on feelings rather than facts. As a transwoman writes in The Guardian commenting on the difference between race and transgenderism in the context of Rachel Dolezal’s deceptive life as a black person despite being born white: “The fundamental difference between Dolezal’s actions and trans people’s is that her decision to identify as black was an active choice, whereas transgender people’s decision to transition is almost always involuntary […] Doctors don’t announce our race or color when we are born; they announce our gender. […] Thus, Dolezal identified as black, but I am a woman, and other trans people are the gender they feel themselves to be.”

While I tend to think anatomy and DNA trumps feelings, I won’t attempt to make a case against the existence of transgender people or their issues. Yet without acknowledging that all young people are constantly dealing with psychological, physiological, and emotional changes and feelings that fluctuate sometimes daily, schools are charging full-speed ahead, changing their policies to align with these demands. This means school-age children are using their fluctuating feelings to dominate and even extinguish the voices of others through lawsuits and school policies.

The Argument for Transgender Bathrooms in Schools Is Misleading

Transgender student Casey Hoke wrote in the Huffington Post, “As long as private stalls are available, absolutely no one should suffer from ‘harm’ in the presence of a transgender person unless the person creates a threatening or harmful situation for the other people in the facility […] That’s that.”

I really want to believe this. In fact, to an extent I do. On the surface, a transgender wants to use an opposite-sex bathroom, and they are going to use that bathroom to do their deed and move on. Some parents have expressed concern over their children’s safety. While understandable, admittedly those concerns may be mostly unfounded and there are probably more pressing safety issues in school bathrooms—such as using selling or using drugs—than the sex of the person using what restroom. But I still think Hoke’s statements, however genuine, are naive.

If the issue is truly about comfort, how does the comfort of a transgender student trump that of the non-transgender student?

Superficially, a transgender advocate (be it a parent, coach, or the student himself) contends transgenders must be allowed in the bathroom of the gender for which they identify because if they use the other bathroom they feel ostracized or even uncomfortable. Indeed, how awkward it must be for a student with a vagina, but who dresses like a male, to relieve herself in the stall of a restroom where other girls, who dress like girls, are doing the same thing! How archaic.

But what of all the girls who identify as girls who must go the bathroom with a girl who identifies as a boy? Is that not equally uncomfortable? Especially when one considers that the number of non-transgender students outweighs transgender students by a significant margin?

If the issue is truly about comfort, how does the comfort of a transgender student trump that of the non-transgender student? If it somehow helps a transgender child to use the bathroom among peers with whom he identifies, does it not equally help a child to use the bathroom among peers who possess the same genitals? This is where the argument begins to fray, if not fall apart altogether.

These Bathroom Policies Force Inequality On Most Students

Policies that allow transgenders to use opposite-sex bathrooms still infringe on the privacy rights of non-transgender students. If equality is truly the goal, then allowing a transgender to use the bathroom with members of the opposite sex cannot be the answer, because it doesn’t treat both parties equally. Given the aforementioned lawsuits, I don’t think the goal of the LGBTQ community is to have equal rights, but to monopolize the rights of everyone else.

A LGBTQ person should be no freer than other people to demand special treatment, especially if that treatment imposes on other people’s basic rights.

A person is not free to step on someone else’s toes just because he feels a certain way. I teach my children they cannot be unkind to someone because they are feeling grouchy or rude. A LGBTQ person should be no freer than other people to demand special treatment, especially if that treatment imposes on other people’s basic rights.

Adults should strive to make the lives of children both at home and school as peaceable as possible. But not to the point where making peace, accepting different lifestyle choices, and paving a path towards equality becomes a mobocracy of laws and lawsuits that, while supposedly liberating one group of minorities (in the statistical sense), entraps and effectually marginalizes everyone else.

Transgender Regret Is Real Even If The Media Says Otherwise,"The Washington Post reported Tuesday that the White House has appointed its first openly transgender staff member. Raffi Freedman-Gurspan has been hired as an outreach and recruitment director for presidential personnel in the White House Office of Presidential Personnel.

I do not know how this will work out for the White House but everyone needs to know the truth about regret, suicides and untreated mental illness among the transgender population.

When Carol Costello, CNN reporter, interviewed me in June on the subject of Olympian, trans-Jenner, she couldn’t help beginning with a false narrative that only 2 percent regret of transgender have regrets. That is, the media’s propensity to fluff over the regret statistics.

Early in the interview , she made the statement, “We have researched… and we found a recent Swedish study that found only 2.2 percent of transgenders, male and female, suffered from sex change regret.”

Costello is a bright reporter. That it is why it was so puzzling she would use her interview of me to misinform her audience, unless the intent was to diminish and dismiss reports of sex change regret among the transgender population. Costello used only one study to reach a conclusion on the frequency of regret. She or her staff did not look at the wealth of other studies that suggest sex change regret is quite common. One such study commissioned by The Guardian of the UK in 2004 reviewed 100 studies and reported that a whopping 20 percent (one fifth) of transgenders regret changing genders, ten times more than CNN’s Costello reported.

The review of 100 studies also revealed that many transgenders remained severely distressed and even suicidal after the gender change operation. Suicide and regret remain the dark side of transgender life.

The Media—Unwilling to Show the Dark Side

The media cover-up of regret and suicides isn’t a new phenomenon; it was in play 36 years ago. In 1979 Dr. Charles Ihlenfeld, who worked alongside the famous Dr. Harry Benjamin for six years administering hormone therapy to some 500 transgenders, spoke to an audience in New York about his experience: “There is too much unhappiness among people who have had the surgery. Too many of them end as suicides.”

Thirty-six years of the insanity of ignoring poor outcomes and hoping they will go away is long enough.

The media was unwilling to report the unhappiness then, and ever since has downplayed any results that would raise the alarm about poor outcomes. Albert Einstein said that insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Thirty-six years of the insanity of ignoring poor outcomes and hoping they will go away is long enough.

The unhappiness continues. Last month, Jenner used the occasion of accepting the ESPY award for courage to tell the world that 41 percent of transgenders attempt suicide. We can debate all day long the various reasons why trans-people have regret and attempt suicide because the reasons are many and diverse. But no debate is needed in the face of the evidence that, for some, changing genders causes unhappiness and ends in suicide.

Come on, Carol, it’s time to stop perpetuating the misinformation that transgender regret is rare.

Transgender regret is not rare

The study commissioned by The Guardian of the UK in 2004 reviewed 100 studies and found 20 percent regret. Consider the findings of a 2011 Swedish study (not the study Ms. Costello used) published seven years after the 2004 UK review. It looked at mortality and morbidity after gender reassignment surgery and found that people who changed genders had a higher risk of suicide.

What are suicide and attempted suicide but symptoms of tremendous depression and unhappiness?

In this study, all the sex-reassigned persons in Sweden from 1973–2003 (191 male-to-females, 133 female-to-males) were compared to a comparable random control group. The sex-reassigned persons had substantially higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and suicide, and substantially higher rates of attempted suicide. What are suicide and attempted suicide but symptoms of tremendous depression and unhappiness?

My life story and the stories of those who contact me speak of regret over transitioning. Often, the stories include attempted suicide or suicide ideation.

I was a 4 year old trans-kid who grew up with gender confusion and underwent gender reassignment surgery at age 42. I lived for 8 years as a so-called trans-female named Laura Jensen. But no matter how feminine I appeared, like all transgenders, I was just a man in a dress. I was unhappy, regretful of having transitioned and I attempted suicide. Gender surgery is not effective treatment for depression, anxiety or mental disorders.

Astonishing evidence of other illness

According to several studies, the majority of transgenders have co-existing disorders that need to be treated. This helps to explain why regret and suicide are prevalent among transgenders. The following studies provide irrefutable evidence that transgenders overwhelmingly suffer from a variety of mental disorders. Neither CNN nor Carol Costello will report studies such as these.

“90 percent of these diverse patients had at least one other significant form of psychopathology” reported Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, Department of Psychiatry in a 2009 study of transgender outcomes at their clinic. In other words, 90 percent of the patients were suffering from a mental illness that gender surgery did not alleviate.

61 percent of the patients treated for cross-gender identification (359 people) had other psychiatric disorders and illnesses, notably personality, mood, dissociative, and psychotic disorders according to a 2003 Dutch survey of board-certified Dutch psychiatrists.

A 2013 University of Louisville, KY study of 351 transgender individuals found that the rates of depression and anxiety symptoms within the study “far surpass the rates of those for the general population.” About half had depressive symptoms and more than 40 percent had symptoms of anxiety.

In all the rhetoric about gender change success you cannot find one sound bite from any media source that acknowledges that even one transgender suffers from a serious mental illness, much less reporting the 90 percent like Case Western Reserve University found, or the 61 percent that the survey of Dutch psychiatrists reported. The numbers are astonishingly high, yet no media reports it.

Fair-minded individuals would see the cumulative effect of the findings—20 percent have regret, 41 percent attempt suicide, 90 percent have a “significant form of psychopathology”, 61 percent also have other psychiatric disorders and illnesses, 50 percent had depressive symptoms, 40 percent showed symptoms of anxiety—and be troubled by the push to surgery and transition as the first course of treatment for transgenders.

Yet the media is silent. It’s so much easier to deliver the LGBT talking point than to dig into the science.

True compassion starts with the truth

The fallout of the media’s inclination to overlook the negative findings is simple: nothing will change. It’s insanity to continue the cover-up and expect different outcomes. Thirty years from now, the environment will be the same. Co-existing mental illnesses in transgenders won’t be treated. The attempted suicide rate will be high; transition regret will occur with frequency. Every time a transgender ends his or her life, the LGBT will blame society or the victim and push for more laws to “protect” them.

Apparently transgender lives do not matter: not to the LGBT and not to the media.

Apparently transgender lives do not matter: not to the LGBT and not to the media. It’s time for the media to stand up and provide the overwhelming evidence for all to see that mental illness, regret and suicide exist among transgenders. Only then will we see true improvement in the outcomes for all.

I believe that true compassion is shown by raising factual issues, based on scientific research, and having the best minds follow the evidence to provide the best care for this segment of our society that is suffering. Packaging the issue in the wrapper of political correctness or withholding the negative findings is not compassion. Political correctness hinders research and treatment of the medical conditions and muzzles a media that’s willing to participate in a false narrative. Who’s the loser? The transgender who regrets transitioning.

The White House plays politics with a vulnerable part of our population to score points with the LGBT but the risks of regret, suicide and untreated mental issues remain for the transgender population.

Why Same-Sex Marriage Will Never Measure Up To The Real Thing,"According to American icon and signer of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson, “The care of human life and happiness and not their destruction is the first and only legitimate object of good government.”

This bit of wisdom is seen in many of America’s policies and traditions, including the abolition of slavery and our respect for religious liberty.

It’s also why marriage deserves special attention from government — and its redefinition does not.

What is it about marriage that earns special attention from government when no other sexual relationship does? As David told Huffington Post reporter Jen Bendery last month on a panel at The Daily Caller, marriage has numerous benefits that are exclusive to heterosexual relationships.

Here are four reasons same-sex marriage will never measure up to the real thing:

1. The Species Only Survives Because Of Heterosexual Relationships

Marriage produces more taxpayers. By providing a social stamp of approval and public policies friendly to marriage, government is encouraging the survival of the human species and the creation of more tax dollars in the environment that — study after study has found — is best for children.

While same-sex couples may have strong feelings for each other, such feelings can never translate into new life without using heterosexual-based technology like IVF. It is mind-bogglingly hypocritical that the LGBTQ community thinks using IVF — which requires male and female components to make a human life — is a solution that justifies their barren relationships.

IVF opens up a brand new tier of moral problems, as it puts unborn children into the position of being sold like slaves and, even worse, killed when they are not implanted.

But even without the hypocrisy, IVF is not a solution to the inability of same-sex couples to have children. Rather, IVF opens up a brand new tier of moral problems, as it puts unborn children into the position of being sold like slaves and, even worse, killed when they are not implanted.

2. Think Of The Children

Second, contrary to popular reports, people raised by same-sex couples are not as well developed as those raised by married parents. Comprehensive research published earlier this year by Catholic University of America researcher Dr. Paul Sullins found that “emotional problems were over twice as prevalent…for children with same-sex parents than for children with opposite-sex parents.”

Sullins’ data are bolstered by personal stories from the International Children’s Rights Institute. Founded by bisexual University of California professor Roberto Oscar Lopez, it promotes “basic rights,” including “a right to a mother and a father, wherever possible” for every child. Earlier this year, Lopez — who is married with three children — and five other people raised by same-sex parents filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court asking it to not change the legal definition of marriage.

Their reason? It’s bad for children.

3. Marriage Is Great For You — And Same-Sex Relationships Aren’t

Third, marriage produces longer life spans, especially for men. In 2011, a survey of 90 studies found that single men die eight to 17 years earlier than married males. Life spans for single women decrease by seven to 15 years compared with their married counterparts.

Conversely, a number of studies have found lower life expectancies for same-sex sexual couples. While the invention of anti-retroviral drugs has narrowed the gap, anal sex between men has led to this small segment of society making up at least two-thirds of all HIV/AIDS cases in America.

Taxpayers have a right to not be held financially accountable for poor life decisions with predictable consequences.

Other illnesses are also more prevalent among the gay and lesbian populations than for the general population. Laura Durso, now Director of the LGBT Research and Communications Project at the Center for American Progress, told PolitiFact in 2012 that evidence indicates breast cancer and anal cancer more often affect lesbians and gay men, respectively.

The above observations are important not just for the harm to each person, but also for the integrity of the public dollar. In an era when the cost of government’s role in government is increasing, the Centers for Disease Control encourages monogamy, condoms, and medicine for gay men more than it pushes for abstinence. Likewise, public dollars are used to pay for condoms and anti-retroviral drugs. While these taxpayer-funded Band-aids may do some good and are signs of the tremendous compassion and ingenuity of human beings, they are not real solutions.

Taxpayers have a right to not be held financially accountable for poor life decisions with predictable consequences.

4. Society Is Empowered By Marriage And Weakened By Its Redefinition

Lastly, the families that come from marriage create communities that empower each other. Bonds are formed, friends are made. As has been seen in Europe, Canada, and a number of U.S. states, however, redefining marriage brings persecution, reduction in liberties of speech and religion, and threatens the very fabric of equal treatment under the law.

Bendery, a bright, passionate woman with whom David had a lively dialogue, told the audience they spoke to that redefining — or, let’s be frank, undefining — government’s role in marriage is about equality and fairness. However, it is not the role of government to provide “fairness” in marriage; its goal should be to do what’s best for society.

Alas, based upon the available science, the many benefits of marriage are not transferrable to its redefinition for same-sex couples.

Consider an analogy: Many people think that searching Google makes their opinions about the Supreme Court as valid as an attorney’s or that looking at Wikipedia makes them experts in the medical field. Under this “fairness” doctrine, shouldn’t the government endorse giving just anyone a medical degree and a scalpel or a pilot’s license and an F-16?

Or would that idea of “fairness” cause undue harm to individuals and society writ large?

The same is true for government’s role in marriage. The burden of proof to expand the government’s definition — to “earn” social approval, tax benefits, etc. — of marriage is on same-sex couples. Like anyone who wants to receive a degree or a certificate, same-sex couples must make the case that they add benefits equal to those of marriage.

Alas, based upon the available science, the many benefits of marriage are not transferrable to its redefinition for same-sex couples.

Frankly, We’re Having The Wrong Debate

Despite what the LGBTQ movement claims, the debate over same-sex “marriage” isn’t a debate of equal relationships or civil rights; it has nothing in common with this country’s Civil Rights Era. After all, race is something that is inborn. Dozens of twin studies have found no link between genetics and same-sex sexual attractions.

The public policy debate should focus on whether relationships that reduce health outcomes should be granted special benefits by government.

It’s also not about sexual attraction. Otherwise, practically every male past the age of puberty would earn special government attention walking down the street. Yet heterosexually attracted men do not receive government benefits until they tie the proverbial knot in a relationship proven to dramatically benefit society.

The public policy debate should focus on whether relationships that reduce health outcomes, are bad for children, and do not serve to continue the survival of the human species should be granted special benefits by government.

So how could the LGBTQ community reward society enough to earn a place with married couples, rather than just have it misleadingly granted by judicial activists? By meeting the same standards of excellence of benefits for society as those who are married.

Why The Left Hunts Kim Davis,"Kim Davis is now in jail. On the one hand, it probably didn’t have to be this way. She could have deputized another member of her office to sign marriage licenses for same-sex couples. Or, even more simply, she could have resigned à la St. Thomas More. Davis’s position—forbidding her entire office to authorize any marriage licenses—is untenable.

On the other hand, it was always going to be this way. The state can’t demand total obeisance to a new fundamental right that directly contradicts a widely-shared religious conviction without breaking a few dissenters. If it wasn’t Davis, it would have been (and may still be) someone else.

What we have here is a quixotic local bureaucrat from a sparsely-populated county in the Appalachian foothills who has been rebuked by every authority she has come up against and whose cause has been championed only by the most reflexive revanchists in social conservatism (although jailing her is expanding her base of sympathy). In other words, the media would have us believe, we have a Major Constitutional Crisis.

Within 12 hours on Tuesday, BuzzFeed had published three stories on Davis by three different writers—and they have dispatched a reporter (writer number four) to Morehead, Kentucky. As I write this, BuzzFeed has splashed an unflattering photo of the middle-aged clerk across its homepage with the enormous caption, “In Contempt, In Custody.” I received a rare breaking news notification on my phone when a federal judge ordered her to prison.

This is the media equivalent of tossing a grenade to shoo a fly. Davis’s mainstream support is thin and qualified. She has lost in the courts, and was always going to. The media pretense is that this is a test case, but the fact pattern is so incredibly weak for Davis that it’s more like a show trial meant to demonstrate what happens to marriage dissenters.

Bring Out the Stocks

Most telling of all, journalists have gleefully picked up BuzzFeed’s “scoop” that Davis, a recent convert to a fringe Christian denomination, is on her fourth marriage. As Ian Millhiser, a ThinkProgress writer and attorney, put it on Twitter: “She’s the perfect villain.”

It’s nothing less than the modern stocks where smarmy bien pensants lob combox rotten tomatoes at the stupid religious mountain lady.

The legal sanctions aren’t enough for progressive activists and their media advocates. It’s all too sterile, too procedural. She must be personally destroyed and the rolling hills of Rowan County salted in her wake. Pour encourager les autres.

It’s nothing less than the modern stocks where smarmy bien pensants lob combox rotten tomatoes at the stupid religious mountain lady. Of course these are the same people—both the journalists who set up this voyeuristic freak show and the eager onlookers—who wrote their Georgetown University application essays about the passion for independent thinking they formed in reading “The Scarlet Letter” and “The Crucible.”

(Public humiliation has always been and will always be part of maintaining community standards. What’s galling is that modern progressives continue to claim the legacy of Hester Prynne rather than her tormentors, whose methods they have modernized.)

We Will Crush You

But the disproportionate attention being paid to eastern Kentucky is about more than the public humiliation of a heretic. It’s about maintaining the peculiarly effective narrative on which the same-sex marriage movement has rested.

What LGBT activists needed to do, then, was not so much defeat a collection of arguments but undermine the perceived respectability of traditional marriage.

Many years before Obergefell, same-sex marriage activists accurately identified the underbelly of their opponents’ political and cultural position: Most support for “traditional marriage” was not based on a sophisticated and principled conviction, but rather the social intuition that supporting marriage-as-it-has-always-been was the safe, respectable opinion. What LGBT activists needed to do, then, was not so much defeat a collection of arguments but undermine the perceived respectability of traditional marriage.

This was a task of tearing down rather than building up. In truth, any ambitious social movement depends on demonizing its opponents for long-term success. So we ended up with sit-coms portraying conservative religious types as silly, hypocritical, irrational, and mean-spirited. And we ended up with the taking of increasingly prominent scalps—culminating perhaps with Mozilla’s Brendan Eich and Atlanta’s nationally-awarded fire chief Kelvin Cochran—to demonstrate where the power is, and where the socially and professionally safe ground is.

But the villains LGBT advocates identified have continued to shrink in number and stature as the movement’s legal and cultural gains are being consolidated. That a Podunk county clerk is the best monster-du-jour they can scrounge up should be proof enough that the baddies bench is running a little thin. But Davis’s relative insignificance is exactly why she must be so thoroughly eviscerated. No one must feel themselves to be safely beyond the reach of the new orthodoxy.

Obergefell Was Only the Beginning

More than that, though, activists and activist media must maintain the fiction that the same-sex marriage movement remains a plucky grassroots uprising against the dark strength of institutionalized ignorance and bigotry. If this really is a new civil-rights movement, it can’t just stop with Obergefell.

Most mainstream opposition having been effectively scythed, they now conjure rural poltergeists to slay for the benefit of the rest of the country.

The “marriage equality” folks have won, legally and culturally and so on, for the foreseeable future. With a few exceptions, even the GOP presidential candidates want nothing to do with marriage. But the momentum must be continued, lest the excited millennials whose Edmund Pettus Bridge was that incredible Twitter takedown of Todd Starnes fall into apathy. Most mainstream opposition having been effectively scythed, they now conjure rural poltergeists to slay for the benefit of the rest of the country.

The conventional idea is that this will, eventually, settle down. Good liberal societies are supposed to be self-regulating. There will be a new respectability equilibrium where it will be considered uncouth—a violation of fair play—to drag out into the public square a marginal sexual counterrevolutionary for humiliation. The only question is how marginal marriage traditionalism will have to become before the referee calls the bout and we go back to an uneasy but workable live-and-let-live.

But what if we are no longer (or never were) a good liberal society? What if there’s a new dispensation? What if decades of casual relativism has resulted in a void that is being filled not by a self-critical broadmindedness but by a pious commitment to autonomy, especially sexual autonomy? What if the unprecedented freedom to express introduced by the Internet becomes a more effective (but less easily recognized) means to enforce orthodoxy rather than to proliferate heterodoxy?

Well, then we should expect to continue to see increasingly insignificant citizens’ faces splashed on the home pages of BuzzFeed and the Huffington Post and Slate and MSNBC and CNN and the Washington Post and The New York Times and whatever other media are invented going forward. That’s because even after opposition to the new marriage orthodoxy is well and truly squelched, public humiliations are great fun. And someone has to click those ads.

Sexual Orientation Doesn’t Mean Anything,"What does it actually mean when we refer to one’s “sexual orientation” or “gender identity”? The answers seem obvious—that is, until we actually have to land on an answer. This question takes on great importance when it involves consequential public policies, such as the one Houston and many other jurisdictions currently face.

Recall that, in 2014, Houston Mayor Annise Parker passed the smoothly titled Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) through her city council to much fanfare, then proceeded to demand her city’s pastors dutifully submit “all speeches, presentations or sermons” related to HERO to her for approval.

The Texas Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the council must either repeal the ordinance or put it up for a vote by Houston’s citizens. That vote will be November 3. The only language in Proposition 1 under debate is its inclusion of the terms “sexual orientation” and “gender identity.” Contrary to elite assumptions, compelling reasons do exist for rejecting the ordinance beyond those mouth-breathers’ refusal to join the “right side of history” and all that.

A major reason is that the terms “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” are terribly subjective. They mean very different things to reasonable people, and find no common definition even within the LGBT community. Consequential public policy demands more precision. If we don’t know what these terms mean, nobody can know if he is violating the law or not until hauled into court, and even then various judges are likely to disagree.

So, what does “sexual orientation” actually include and exclude? How is one’s “gender identity” determined and legally ascertained? Neither of these are objective, measurable personal characteristics like race, sex, color, ethnicity, pregnancy, disability, etc., but they are assumed as such in laws like this. Great trouble arises when we assume we are all talking about the same thing here but in fact are not. Let’s see how this is precisely case we have today.

Gender Identity Isn’t Settled Science

Gender theorists confidently explain what gender is with this clever ditty: “Sex is what’s between your legs. Gender is what’s between your ears.” I think, therefore I am. He’s a man purely because he understands himself as such, regardless of what his original physical factory settings may indicate. She is a woman for the very same reasons. And no one can say otherwise. Does a better example of subjectivity exist? But this understanding is far from settled among leading scholars.

Gender as something distinct from sex is a relatively new idea that originates, not from any scientific discovery, but pure ideology.

Gender as something distinct from sex is a relatively new idea that originates, not from any scientific discovery, but pure ideology. As J. Richard Udry explained in a celebrated presidential address to the annual meeting of the Population Association of America, sex and gender have long meant the same thing, with gender generally used grammatically when one needed to distinguish physiology from coitus. But today, he explains, “In our urge to be politically correct… we use gender to indicate endorsement of a theory of gender as a human social invention.” Udry was writing before the trans question became center stage, and this creates a fiery head-on collision between two fundamental dogmas of gender studies.

My maleness, your femaleness—the way we understand ourselves, the way we believe we are—is merely an artificial “social construct.” Unless you’re trans. Then the male or female you believe yourself to be is natural, absolute, and beyond dispute. Gender spectrum believers don’t have a good answer for this conflict.

Back to gender as distinct from sex. David Haig, a professor of evolutionary biology at Harvard University, conducted an intriguing study on how the terms “sex” and “gender” have been contrastingly used over the decades in the social and biological sciences by examining the titles of some 30 million academic articles. He found that, prior to 1960, the use of gender was extremely rare in both the hard and soft sciences. In the following years, the term slowly grew in the social science and humanities literature, but was rarely used in the biological literature. Today, the harder sciences employ gender more frequently than 20 years ago, but for interesting reasons.

Haig explains: “Among the reasons that working [natural] scientists have given me for choosing gender rather than sex in biological contexts are desires to signal sympathies with feminist goals, to use a more academic term, or to avoid the connotation of copulation. The major increase in the use of gender, and the associated decline of sex, occurred in the 1980s, after the adoption of gender as a technical term in feminist discourse.” It was not because any new scientific finding demanded such a distinction.

Now, to how gender is related to identity. Bruce Jenner is a woman and always has been. Disagree at your own peril. But when did Bruce Jenner became Caitlyn? At birth? When he came to terms with it himself? When he first announced his news to the world? When he legally changed his name? When he appeared on the cover of Vogue?

Caitlyn Jenner’s gender, as with all other transgender folks, exists solely in what’s between his ears.

Bruce is the only one who can tell us for sure, and this true for every trans individual. Even that could change from day to day, and we have to honor each new telling. People ask honest and sincere questions, wanting to truly understand what’s going on here: Can Caitlyn really be Caitlyn if he still has Bruce’s penis? Would Caitlyn be Cait if he kept a beard? What if he retained a total outer appearance suitable for the cover of GQ? Of course he would, because his gender, as with all other transgender folks, exists solely in what’s between his ears, his own understanding of himself, regardless of how he chooses to display it to the world. It is Jenner’s private business, but we all have to honor it.

Another less famous real-world example of this reality was dumped in the lap of an unsuspecting Michigan woman at her local Planet Fitness gym. She entered the woman’s locker room and was confronted by a man doing his business sporting a woman’s wig and some poorly applied facial rouge. Mortified, she alerted the management and was told she would have to live with it because their corporate policy states that “members and guests may use all gym facilities based on their sincere self-reported gender identity.”

“Sincere” and “self-reported.” Is that not a can of worms? At least Planet Fitness has some sort of criteria. The Houston Ordinance offers no definition, language, or guidelines about what does or does not constitute “gender identity.” Laws backed by substantial fines and penalties, not to mention the potential for publicly shaming violators, require some form of objective clarity.

Sexual Orientation Is Meaningless, Too

Our culture uses the term “sexual orientation” with absolute confidence in its definition, such that to even raise the question would peg one as embarrassingly dull-witted. But this, even among LGBT leaders, is not clear at all. Professor Randall Sell, one of the leading scholars researching the nature of sexual orientation, observes, “At present it is clear that researchers are confused as to what they are studying when they assess sexual orientation in their research. …Today’s preferred terms and the term ‘sexual orientation’ itself have a wide variety of definitions in the literature…”

‘Researchers are confused as to what they are studying when they assess sexual orientation in their research,’

The serious student of this topic need only enter “definition of sexual orientation” into a search engine to prove the fact. For instance, the most authoritative organizations on the subject offer these definitions:

Human Rights Campaign: “An inherent or immutable enduring emotional, romantic or sexual attraction to other people.”

American Psychological Association: “An enduring pattern of emotional, romantic and/or sexual attractions to men, women or both sexes. …[O]ne’s sexual orientation defines the group of people in which one is likely to find the satisfying and fulfilling romantic relationships that are an essential component of personal identity for many people.”

Psychology Today: “Sexual orientation is a term used to describe our patterns of emotional, romantic, and sexual attraction—and our sense of personal and social identity based on those attractions. A person’s sexual orientation is not a black or white matter; sexual orientation exists along a continuum.”

WebMD; Sexual orientation is a term used to refer to a person’s emotional, romantic, and sexual attraction to individuals of a particular gender (male or female).

Precisely what kinds of ’emotional, romantic and sexual attractions’ denote what a ‘sexual orientation’ actually is and isn’t?

PFLAG: “Emotional, romantic, or sexual feelings toward other people…. One’s sexual activity does not define who one is with regard to one’s sexual orientation; it is the attraction that helps determine orientation.”

GLAAD: “Simply put: sexual orientation is about who you are attracted to and fall in love with; Sexual orientation describes a person’s enduring physical, romantic, and/or emotional attraction to another person.”

The words “emotional,” “romantic,” and “sexual” in relation to “attraction” and “feelings” seem to be the common characteristics in these various definitions. But these constancies do little to answer the question any attentive person should ask: Precisely what kinds of “emotional, romantic and sexual attractions” denote what a “sexual orientation” actually is and isn’t?

Many, but not all, assumptively confine it to being gay, straight, or bisexual. But others in the LGBT community and elsewhere contend that these are merely the main players on the current stage of sexual diversity. They contend there are more “sexual orientations” still. A stark example demonstrates the problem.

Yet Another Sexual Orientation

Salon recently published a provocative piece by a man who introduces himself this way: “I’ve been stuck with the most unfortunate of sexual orientations, a preference for a group of people who are legally, morally and psychologically unable to reciprocate my feelings and desires. It’s a curse of the first order, a completely unworkable sexuality, and it’s mine. Who am I? …I’m a pedophile.”

Our pedophile says his sexual attraction to children is an orientation because it’s how he has always been.

Now we can imagine a sea of eyes rolling at the supposed ridiculousness of his claim that his set of feelings is an orientation. But under what criteria should it be excluded?

Certainly not because this sexual attraction is repulsive. No current definition makes that qualification. If one’s emotional, romantic, and sexual attraction has to be socially approved in order to be a bona fide sexual orientation, then when did bi- or homosexuality hit that critical tipping point in its public acceptance? Has it presently? The subjectivity in all this is obvious with just the slightest bit of thought.

Many will say an actual orientation must be something embedded within each individual, natural to what and who they are. Our pedophile understands this, and says his sexual attraction to children—which he judges as horrific and claims he has intentionally never acted on and hopes he never does—is an orientation because it’s how he has always been. He mimics the language of those (see pg. 2 under the first heading) who explain the nature and origins of same-sex attraction:

Some researchers surmise that pedophilia can be traced back to genetics. Others believe the cause is congenital, and still others that it’s environmental. Personally, I think the ultimate cause is likely some combination of those, and that it varies from person to person.

Again, by what criteria would we prove him wrong? Those who follow this topic very closely will remind us that the newest version of the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM-V) holds the answer, as it originally listed pedophilia as an orientation. But a press release was circulated by the American Psychiatric Association, which publishes the DSM, stating that the designation should not be an orientation, but a “sexual interest.” But it’s not that simple.

It’s Impossible to Draw a Line

Just as there was significant political pressure on the American Psychiatric Association decades ago to take homosexuality off the list of psychological illnesses, similar pressure was applied here. A professor in the school of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins, writing in The Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, explains that the APA removed the “orientation” designation “in the face of significant criticism” and not because of a misprint.

It’s not just pervs seeking legitimacy who are contending pedophilia is an orientation.

This professor explains that for important clinical reasons “removing the term in response to public criticism would be a mistake.” He contends that “experiencing ongoing sexual attractions to prepubescent children is, in essence, a form of sexual orientation” and that an important distinction for clinicians is to distinguish between the psychiatric and criminal aspects of this orientation, attraction as distinct from behavior.

Agree with him or not, but his article—and the journal’s editorial board’s decision to publish it—demonstrates it’s not just pervs seeking legitimacy who are contending it’s an orientation. How exactly would Houston’s ordinance, or any other, legally exclude Mr. Pedophile?

Pedophilia is not the only romantic, emotional, and sexual attraction confounding our assumed sureness of what an orientation is. The polys claim their place under the banner, too. Polyamorists (and non-polys) assert that desiring “many loves” simultaneously is an orientation. They take themselves and this understanding of their own romantic, emotional, and sexual attractions very seriously, even hosting their own annual conference. Loving More, the largest poly support organization in the United States, answers the question “Is polyamory an innate orientation?” this way:

For some it seems to be, for others not. Some people…are indeed polyamorous by nature. Despite good hearts and good intentions they repeatedly fail at monogamy, or live miserable lives if they do manage to stay romantically exclusive. …The evidence seems to be that some people are just not wired for monogamy and need more than one love to feel complete as a person.

Enter the Polys

This, of course, would also be true of polygamists. If you hold that polys and polygs are mistaken in this, prove it by the definitions above or any you can find. You’ll be frustrated. But, like our pedophile, it’s not just the self-interested poly activists making the case for inclusion. Respected law professors working for LGBT causes make the case as well.

She holds that one’s predilection for polyamory should legally be accepted as a sexual orientation because many polys report this is simply who they are.

The most prominent, Columbia Law School’s Elizabeth Emens, contends with all seriousness that as our national debate over same-sex marriage expands our understanding of intimate relationships, it is her hope “everyone will take this opportunity to question monogamy” as a preference over non-monogamy. She holds that one’s predilection for polyamory should legally be accepted as a sexual orientation because many polys report this is simply who they are. One person she features explains, “I’ve been Bi and Poly since around the age of 13, and always had more than one relationship going on as a teenager. . . . [M]onogamy is just not my nature.”

Another, named Eddie, explains that those in his poly “family” have relative levels of “intrinsic polyness” leading to what he understands as a “grey scale” among his partners. He says he was polyamorous as a child, while another Emens discusses, Amber, was not. She struggles with jealousy, while Mike has learned to suppress his jealousy. He explains, “I think Adam came hard-wired [as poly] even more so than me.”

Emens concludes that “knowledge of one’s own ‘sexual orientation’ as we typically use the term” also “encompasses self-knowledge about one’s sexual identity with regards to monogamy.” In her paper, Emens properly spends a good deal of energy addressing the essentialist-constructivist question on the nature of sexuality, which of course brings its own distinct understanding of whether “orientation” even describes anything that actually exists.

Consider the voices asserting that monogamy itself is not an orientation but an unnatural and unsustainable social construct, while being gay, lesbian, or bi is just as natural as having blue eyes or brown skin. As our parents told us, if you’re going to start adjusting the truth, you better have a good memory. That advice would save gender theorists from these embarrassing contradictions.

She argues for legally recognizing polyamory in employment discrimination statutes because it is an orientation and such people deserve the protections everyone else has.

The second scholar contending polyamory is an orientation is Ann Tweedy, a professor at Hamline University School of Law. In an article, crisply titled “Polyamory as a Sexual Orientation,” she also argues for legally recognizing polyamory in employment discrimination statutes because it is an orientation and such people deserve the protections everyone else has. Tweedy notes, and enlists the voices of other scholars who agree with her, that the current usage of the term sexual orientation is “somewhat arbitrary,” “inherently unstable,” and “artificially limited.”

She holds that “nothing in the definition of ‘sexual’ or ‘orientation’ suggests that the term ‘sexual orientation’ should be limited to identifying the sex of the people to whom one is attracted.” Number of lovers should be included. She continues, with logical consistency, “Rather, based on the ordinary meanings of its two constitutive words, the term ‘sexual orientation’ should refer to any type of settled sense of direction or relationship or choice or adjustment of associations, connections, or dispositions that relate to libidinal gratification.”

The Inherent Difference in Male and Female Sexuality

Like Emens does with the constructivist theory, Tweedy introduces a major debilitating wrinkle into this issue by directing our attention to the differences in male and female sexuality. We cannot really speak of human sexuality generally, but must discuss in terms of male and female sexuality, as they are very different animals. Research consistently reveals that male sexuality is more fixed, while female sexuality is more flexible. Women are substantially more likely to report being bisexual, and it is not uncommon for self-identified lesbians to behave bisexually regardless of their actual identity or self-described orientation.

It is not uncommon for women to change their identity/orientation from heterosexual to lesbian and vice versa, while men are extremely more likely to report being ‘100 percent homosexual’ or ‘100 percent heterosexual.’

It is not uncommon for women to change their identity/orientation from heterosexual to lesbian and vice versa, while men are extremely more likely to report being “100 percent homosexual” or “100 percent heterosexual,” as the American Sociological Association explains. These facts challenge the propensity of some to speak of human sexuality as consistent and sexual orientation as an objective, fixed human phenomenon.

Given this, Tweedy logically contends that if we are going to speak accurately about what sexual orientation is and is not, then “individuals should be able to define their own sexual orientation” as they do their gender identity. No small number of LGBT theorists wholly agree, contending that there are as many gender identities and sexual orientations are there are people, as each of us lives these out a tad differently than others. No one fully fits into any specific box, but we each create our own.

Under such constructs, we are socially (and legally) compelled to honor and respect each person’s self-determined orientation and self-expressed gender identity. Of course, this inherent subjectivity raises profound practical and legal concerns for adherence to and enforcement of laws like Houston’s equal rights ordinance. The subjectivity makes it ripe for an explosion of unanticipated lawsuits from people who refuse to play along with the “well, we all know what it means” misbelief. Of course, the implications here stretch far beyond Houston. Consider this statement from this summer’s Supreme Court’s majority opinion in Obergefell:

The nature of marriage is that, through its enduring bond, two persons together can find other freedoms, such as expression, intimacy, and spirituality. This is true for all persons, whatever their sexual orientation. (p. 13)

Whatever their sexual orientation…

Ex-Transgenders And -Homosexuals Come Out Of The Closet,"Standing for Truth is a first-time gathering of national experts, therapists, doctors, attorneys, religious leaders, former homosexuals, parents and friends of former homosexuals, children of homosexual parents, and those with transgender surgery regret who dare to speak the truth.

About 20 speakers will be contributing to the day-long conference October 26 in Salt Lake City. I’m that last one in the list above: the one with transgender surgery regret. Detractors have called me a pseudo-celebrity but I find that preferable to living out my life as a pseudo-female or pseudo-female transsexual.

No matter how uncomfortable or inconvenient it may be to LGBT people and their supporters, the rates of transgender regret and suicide remain high and therefore cannot be dismissed as unimportant. Research has shown that more than 60 percent of transgenders suffer from comorbid disorders. To me, that proves transgenders are misdiagnosed a majority of the time. Comorbid disorders are a direct cause for the staggering and shameful attempted suicide rate among transgenders of 41 percent.

Don’t Confuse Transgender and Gay People

I have some hopes for the outcome of the conference and for the people who will be joining me in speaking truth.

First, let me clear up a common misconception. The stated focus of the conference is understanding homosexuality. The funny thing about having me participate is that I was never homosexual, and in my work with regretful transsexuals none of them has been homosexual. The politically incorrect truth is that the vast majority of transgender regretters with whom I’m familiar are, in fact, not homosexual. The transgenders I work with are individuals who suffer from powerful feelings of gender identity confusion but are not dealing with same-sex attraction or homosexuality issues.

The politically incorrect truth is that the vast majority of transgender regretters with whom I’m familiar are, in fact, not homosexual.

Throughout my life, uninformed individuals have assumed I was homosexual. Perhaps that is why I was invited to participate in this conference. I cannot help but wonder how many of the speakers and attendees will be disappointed that I’m not homosexual and never have been.

While I’m on the subject of homosexuality, I’d like to clear up another misconception people have about me and my viewpoint. Some people say I must be anti-homosexual. I’m not. My Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor of last 30 years is a homosexual. I have dinner and spend time with him and other homosexual friends from time to time. So when someone says I’m anti-gay, it shows how little they know about transgenders in general, and about me specifically.

In fact, my homosexual friends encourage me to speak out about the regret they see among transgenders and transsexuals after gender change. LGBT supporters, however, like to blast me as being rabidly anti-LGBT. The truth is, I’m rabidly anti-suicide for transsexuals and transgenders, and I don’t support the many unnecessary gender reassignment surgeries performed on hurting individuals that often result in deep regret.

Where There’s a Will, There’s a Way

Some of the therapists presenting at this conference will be touting the effectiveness of controversial reparative therapies. I have found two truths about therapy and its effectiveness. The first is that no therapy of any kind will be effective if the client is unwilling to participate.

If someone truly wants help and has a real desire to stop troublesome behaviors, the type of therapy doesn’t matter: Change can and will happen.

The flipside is if someone truly wants help and has a real desire to stop troublesome behaviors, the type of therapy doesn’t matter: Change can and will happen. If someone truly wants to change, no one can stop him. On the other hand, if someone does not want to change, no one can influence him to change his behavior.

The conference presenters include religious participants who may talk about how LGBT is transforming the church. Some homosexuals, in defiance of the King James Bible, have prepared their own, called The Queen James Bible, which omits or rewrites all references to homosexuality as a sin.

But I have always felt uneasy when religious leaders focus on the sins of homosexuals and transgenders as if they themselves are free of sin. Scriptures calls all of us sinners in the book of Romans: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23).”

Scripture does not give religious leaders any high road over anyone else regarding sin. We are all sinners and fall short of God’s glory: religious leaders and homosexuals are alike in that regard.

We are all sinners and fall short of God’s glory: religious leaders and homosexuals are alike in that regard.

Church leadership might reject homosexuals outright, thinking they are beyond Christ’s redemption. I found out firsthand how some religious leaders want nothing to do with transgenders. While I was living as Laura Jensen, my transgender persona, I attended a church one Sunday. Later that day, the pastor delivered the harsh news: “We don’t want your kind in our church.” Thankfully, that wasn’t the end of the story.

Another church leader welcomed me and allowed me to become a part of the church. Because of this church, whose members and leadership loved and prayed for me, a transgender, I was eventually redeemed and restored. Pastors need to trust God that Christ’s power and grace can, and often does, redeem transsexuals and homosexuals.

A Desperate Need for Legal Beagles

What major conference would be complete without attorneys addressing the legal ramifications of the LGBT agenda? I have a personal interest in the legalities of gender designation on birth records. I hope the lawyers at this conference will speak the truth about the roadblocks regretters encounter in restoring original gender markers on their birth records.

Judges so far have not allowed my birth record to be restored to male.

From the legal viewpoint, my life has been destroyed twice. The first destruction came in 1983. After the surgeons feminized my appearance with their knives, the courts agreed that my gender changed and my birth record could be legally revised from male to female. The second devastation has been courts’ repeated denial of my petitions since 1989 to restore my male gender designation on my birth record. Lawyers have helped me prepare a strategy and the paperwork several times, but judges so far have not allowed my birth record to be restored to male.

My last attempt to restore my male gender marker on my birth certificate was in 2011, after California changed its law to allow anyone to change his or her legal gender without having to have surgery. (Previously, gender change surgery was a legal requirement for this.) A California Superior Court judge denied my right to legally restore my gender to male. After all these years of being restored to life as a male, my birth record still has the wrong gender.

It is crazy how easily newly-minted transgenders can change their gender in the courts. But for those who regret undergoing gender change, the door slams shut. Like me, they are sentenced to pay for their regretful decision by having the wrong gender specified on their birth certificate, with no legal recourse.

Medical Truth Tellers

Physicians will speak at the conference, and I know some of them will address the obvious fact that is biologically impossible to change anyone’s gender. Sure, the cosmetic surgeries can make it look that way, but it is all an elaborate surgical masquerade. Cosmetic changes are incapable of producing a biological change of gender. Some regretters have told me how tiring it was to keep up the masquerade.

Perhaps the most amazing truth during the conference will come from the stories of Janet Boynes, a former homosexual; Regina Griggs, parent of a former homosexual; Andrew Graham, a former homosexual; Dawn Stefanowicz, who was raised by a gay parent; and even myself, a transgender regretter.

I hope an open forum across various disciplines like what is being presented at this conference helps people better understand both sides of the social issue. Keep your eye on this first-of-its kind conference, and pray. Pray that it will breathe truth into those who struggle with gender identity issues or same-sex attraction and the families who love them.

Houston Rejects Special LGBT Privileges By Huge Margin,"One local Houston election item from yesterday received national attention, the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, or HERO to its supporters. Early results with more than two-thirds of precincts in showed it losing, 62 to 38 percent, despite having passed the City Council 11-6.

HERO did not grant any rights. It added an avenue of recourse for discrimination. Anyone in a protected class who thinks they are being discriminated against can sue in federal court. HERO added an option to complain to the City of Houston. File a complaint and someone would investigate, like calling about pot holes. This was supposed to be more effective than a suit, though goodness knows Houston officials haven’t done a great job responding to pothole complaints.

When HERO passed City Council in May 2014, many Houstonians worried it would be another selectively enforced regulation. Again, using the pothole comparison, neighborhoods in preferred parts of town get street repair, while streets in other areas drive like you are on the moon. (This is Houston. We like lunar analogies.) Similarly, we worried that if you ran a not-preferred business, HERO might cause you to find your business subject to discrimination investigations and fines. Particularly easy would be sting operations, such as transgender males claiming discrimination if an establishment did not allow them to use women’s restrooms.

The ordinance originally contained specific language about this scenario, but that was dropped to assure the City Council would pass it. Still, the bathroom example was particularly vivid and believable with all the national news and sensational stories concerning gender issues.

Let’s Up My National Profile

The media went with HERO. It made for good press. Facing term limits, Mayor Annise Parker wanted it as a resume builder for LGTB support. Wendy Davis was floundering then in her campaign for governor, and Parker probably wanted to fill that role as the Democrats’ up and coming It woman. The example suited her. She had even tweeted her assurances to “my trans sisters/brothers” when she dropped the language singling them out about bathroom privileges. HERO became the bathroom ordinance.

Facing term limits, Mayor Annise Parker wanted HERO as a resume builder for LGTB support.

It all blew up with the petition.

Parker knew the ordinance would not likely pass a city referendum. Houstonians do not like regulations. We are the only major U.S. city without zoning, a fact which makes us notorious to city planners everywhere else but makes complete sense to us. This is why she ran HERO through the City Council in the first place. (Think of Congress passing Obamacare.) The only way to protect her ordinance was to keep it off the ballot.

Local leaders knew this, too. Some circulated a petition to put the ordinance on the ballot. That petition quickly gained enough signatures. Parker had to attack the signatures.

Brilliant Idea: Let’s Attack Free Speech

Some of the local leaders were pastors. That fact presented an option. The city attorney subpoenaed the pastors’ sermons. Readers might remember the outcry early last fall. Parker’s theory was that the pastors used “pulpits for politics” and obtained the signatures by fraud or false statement. She wanted to invalidate enough signatures so the City Council’s refusal to repeal or put the ordinance on the ballot last year, in 2014, would stand.

The act of subpoenaing the sermons drew swift and firm opposition. Parker had to withdraw the subpoena, and HERO came to represent a threat to religious liberty. What little chance of survival it had evaporated.

In July, Parker lost the court case. The per curium opinion held that the ordinance must be repealed or put on the 2015 ballot, as mandated by the city charter.

Tough Sell to Minority Voters

Now we come to the mayors. Houston has mayoral elections in off, or odd years. Most big elections happen in even years. Parker, having been elected for three terms, was term-limited. With no incumbent, the mayoral field was large. It included an African-American man and a Hispanic man, both Democrats like Parker and each with high name recognition. They drew Hispanic and African-American voters to the polls yesterday, two voting groups not known for their support of LGBT issues.

If HERO was a tough sell to regulation-adverse Houstonians in general, it was a lost cause in a year with motivated Hispanic and African-American voters.

If HERO was a tough sell to regulation-adverse Houstonians in general, it was a lost cause in a year with motivated Hispanic and African-American voters. And that is before considering the religious liberty threat from the subpoenaed sermons debacle.

The early voting opened last night with more than 60/40 in opposition to HERO. The numbers did not ease as the night wore on. It failed with only 38 percent of the vote.

Interestingly, the ordinance was undervoted. That is, many voters did not vote on HERO. They knew there was no winning. They could rubber-stamp a redundant regulation primed for abuse or see the city slandered for bigotry.

The fact that Houstonians obviously do not care about a person’s sexual orientation but about how he or she does a job—this is a “fix the problem” kind of city—does not matter. HERO was about LGBT rights. That’s what the media told the public. It failed. So we must be bigots, right?",https://thefederalist.com/2015/11/04/houston-rejects-special-lgbt-privileges-by-huge-margin/,2015-11-04
Gay Man Explains His Petition To Drop The T In LGBT,"Several months ago, I reported on a growing schism between parts of the gay and trans communities regarding the history of the 1969 Stonewall riots, the seminal event of the gay-rights movement.

LGBT and trans advocates called for a boycott of the movie “Stonewall,” complaining that trans women and people of color were the true heroes of Stonewall, not the gay, white men depicted in the Hollywood version. Although opponents of the film offered almost no historical evidence for their claim, the boycott worked, and “Stonewall” performed miserably at the box office.

That is not the end of the story. This past week, a petition emerged on the website Change.org calling for the removal of the T (for trans), from LGBT. “Drop the T,” as the petition is known, criticizes more than the trans community’s appropriation of Stonewall’s legacy. The author of the petition also attacks how the trans movement treats children and its aggressive and authoritarian style of discourse, which does not allow people to question its claims.

The petition, which has more than 1,200 signatures at the time of this writing, was written by an anonymous gay man. I tracked him down, and he agreed to be interviewed. Clayton (not his real name) asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation from the trans movement.

The following interview took place via email on Saturday. It has been lightly edited for length and house style. Thus far, two of the five organizations to which the petition was addressed (Gay Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation and Human Rights Campaign) have responded. Both responses are short, dismissive, and fail to address the concerns of Clayton and the other signatories.

Federalist: How big a role did the Stonewall controversy and the appropriation of the Stonewall story by the trans movement play in your decision to start this petition?

Clayton: It was a very important role. I was a history buff as a child and eventually majored in history in college; when I hit puberty around 11 years old and realized I was gay, part of coming to understand myself was through reading as much history as I could find about gay men and women; naturally, the subject of the Stonewall riots loomed large.

When the brouhaha over the film ‘Stonewall’ first ignited, I was stunned to see the transgender crowd taking sole credit for it.

The majority of rioters were young, gay white men, with a handful of black and Latino men, some lesbians and a few drag queens. When the brouhaha over the film “Stonewall” first ignited, I was stunned to see the transgender crowd taking sole credit for it; even more frustrating was the fact that gay/lesbian media, such as The Advocate, Out, HuffPost Gay Voices, and their journalists who should know to check their facts (and these are easily verifiable facts), allowed this myth to flourish.

It was maddening and frustrating. The identity of the individual who threw the first brick isn’t (and probably won’t ever be) convincingly confirmed, though it is acknowledged that it quite possibly was Marsha P. Johnson, a transvestite, who, it should be noted, still identified as a gay male at the time; and it should also be pointed out that the handful of drag queens who were present at the riots were not transgender as we know them today—straight men who have transitioned to presenting as women. Statements I’ve seen such as “the gay rights movement owes its existence to transgenders” are completely false.

Federalist: I was at the Stonewall twenty-fifth anniversary march in 1994, and at that time we all thought we had a pretty good idea of what had happened at Stonewall. The Stonewall veterans— mostly gay, white men—were viewed as heroic. In the new version of events, the gay, white men at the riot are presented as weak followers, not primary actors. Why do you think so many established gay outlets have so easily accepted this narrative that echoes some of the worst stereotypes about gay men?

Clayton: I wasn’t able to go, but I remember the day clearly—I gathered with friends to watch it all day on C-Span and celebrate. It was wonderful. And, yes, we had a specific perception of Stonewall that has been massively altered by the media, although the historiography remains the same.

You can’t alter history to make you feel better.

It’s difficult for me to say why gay media has allowed this history to be re-written this way; we always acknowledged the role of the drag queens and the lesbian who called out for help for everybody else to fight back—but it seems as if this aspect has become the predominant theme, the story ends there and the fact that the white gay street kids DID start fighting back gets underplayed or thoroughly ignored.

I think there’s a general desire to find heroes in the past that aren’t the usual white guy, and I understand that completely, as a gay kid looking to find gay heroes in a heteronormative history myself. But you can’t alter history to make you feel better, and doing so by twisting a narrative so that heroic men become weak, dithering non-actors in an event is disrespectful to them and ultimately to yourself.

Federalist: Do you believe there are a significant number of gays, lesbians, and bisexuals who are uncomfortable with being associated with the trans movement, but who fear the social repercussions of saying so?

Clayton: Absolutely. Any attempt to rationally discuss issues that gays/lesbians/bisexuals are concerned about regarding the trans movement is met with unparalleled vitriol, harassment, death threats, and silencing—demanding that the person commenting contrary to the trans narrative be banned from forums, for example.

I know that lesbians have for several years been the object of attack from trans activists for their (rightful) desire to enjoy exclusively lesbian and women-only events such as the now shuttered Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival, in the wake of the Stonewall brouhaha as well as the recent proliferation of stories about effeminate boys and masculine girls being directed by their parents and health professionals into the trans identity. So many gays and lesbians were “sissies” and “tomboys” as kids, I think they see themselves in these children and are concerned about them being directed down an inaccurate path.

Federalist: Do you then see a distinction between the gay rights movement, which has traditionally argued for acceptance of individuals as they are, and the trans rights movement which argues that hormones and surgery are often needed to fully transform a person into who they really are? Are these two basic arguments at odds with each other?

Clayton: I think this is an absolutely important distinction that has not been discussed at all. Gay/bisexual men and women just ARE—we don’t need medicine or surgery to help us become who we believe we are, which is the case with the trans community.

We don’t need medicine or surgery to help us become who we believe we are.

To take it further, the first is about sexual and affectional orientation, who we are sexually attracted to and who we choose to share our love with; the latter is about gender identity, and altering one’s body to fit what one’s mind believes it should resemble. They are two very, very different ideas, and the problem that develops when we are all under the same umbrella is that so many of our enemies see us as one and the same—that Caitlyn Jenner, for example, is a “homo,” when that is not the case.

This is why I think the two groups should separate and fight for our respective rights on the more sure footing of our own ideas rather than conflating two divergent concepts.

Federalist: What kind of feedback has the petition been getting? I saw the tweet in favor from Milo Yiannopoulos and several tweets in opposition. Have people flagged the petition as inappropriate?

Clayton: Based on comments I’ve seen at various forums around the net, I’m certain that it has been flagged, though I’ve not been notified of it. Articles about the petition have popped up on various gay blogs such as JoeMyGod and Gay Star News and, frustratingly, they are negative, although many of the comments are supportive.

The LGB movement has always been about expanding and re-defining concepts of gender.

A tweet by Milo Yiannopoulos (Nero) is probably what brought more attention to it, as he is a widely followed gay conservative columnist—which is ironic, since I’m not conservative in the least. I’m a socialist atheist gay man who is pro-choice, against the death penalty, and hoping we get real gun control.

To me, the LGB movement, with its celebration of all types of gay men and women, such as bears, leather daddies, drag queens, diesel dykes, lipstick lesbians, etc., has always been about expanding and re-defining concepts of gender; the trans movement, on the other hand, appears to be about re-asserting and codifying traditional concepts of gender.

Federalist: The gay rights movement made the great strides it did in no small part by emphasizing normalcy. The focus on marriage and adoption was a kind of “we want what you want” approach that was very successful. Do the more radical claims of trans advocates threaten that normalcy by placing everyone in boxes based on varying difference and levels of oppression?

Clayton: It’s quite ironic to me that a generation that allegedly objects so much to labels has turned around and created the most expansive collection of labels there are: transgender, bigender, pangender, agender, genderfluid, genderqueer, etc. And then these self-applied labels are used to create a competition of oppression, where one wrong word can lead to a spewing forth of vicious invectives by the so-called oppressed.

These self-applied labels are used to create a competition of oppression.

Gay men and women succeeded partly because we expressed the desire to be treated equally—so that we could serve in the military, so that we could marry the people we love, etc.—and because we came out to our friends and families as what we are, just regular people trying to get through this journey called life; however, we did occasionally get pretty radical, too: the “zaps” of the 70s transformed into the absolutely necessary actions of Queer Nation and ACT UP in response to the AIDS crisis of the 80s.

But the important factor there was that the activists were, again, simply demanding that we be treated equally and the hetero audience could, in the end, understand that. My concern is that trans activism, which does not align with that of the larger gay/lesbian/bisexual community, is so radical and alienating—the insistence on access to women’s private spaces, the transitioning of young children who likely are just gay/lesbian/bisexual kids—that it will harm the community as a whole.

I wish no harm to the transgender community; I wish them all the happiness that life can offer. But our communities, linked together in such a slender fashion, no longer have a common ground, if we ever did in the first place.

"Racism Isn’t The Problem On Campus, Gender Insanity Is","Picture, if you can, what has gone through my head over the last week. I am a Yale graduate. More specifically, I am a graduate “of color” who survived the allegedly toxic racism of New Haven in the 1980s and 1990s, back in the days when there was still apartheid in South Africa and activists didn’t generally talk about Halloween costumes.

I consider myself the inheritor of three parental figures: my Filipino father, my Puerto Rican mother (with slave roots in a sugar cane valley), and my mother’s white lesbian partner. So I can swing Asian, Latino, black, or white queer, depending on the occasion.

I spent my basic combat training in Missouri, about as far from the University of Missouri as Mizzou is from Ferguson. I was a private “of color” who survived the military-industrial complex, though we were more worried about being sent to fight jihadists in Central Asia than we were about hearing an “alleged” slur from a pick-up truck on our way to blocking a parade. I can talk your ear off about health-care issues for reservists, given that I had a head injury and received a medical discharge. But that’s for another article.

Nowadays I teach at Cal State Northridge in Los Angeles. I am a “professor of color,” the sort of individual that minority protesters at both Yale and Mizzou seem to be demanding more of, to diversify the faculty. Currently, not counting people in early retirement, I am one of only two Latino professors of English on full-time staff at Northridge, the only Latino male who teaches English full-time, and the only Latino professor with a degree in classics (partly because there are only two professors of classics at Northridge and one is en route to retirement).

I Check All the Diversity Boxes

But go figure. I work at a “Hispanic-serving institution” of 40,000 students and thousands of instructors, where I have, if I may boast a little, credentials that equal or surpass the credentials of any white faculty member on campus. Not based on identity politics, mind you, based on passing comprehensive exams in Greek and Latin, as well as gaining fluency in multiple foreign languages. I am also exceedingly fast at taking apart an M-16, cleaning it, and putting it back together again. Just don’t ask me to fire at anything really far away, because I’ll miss. I’m a lousy shot.

I may be a rare case of a professor being stripped of tenure and fired.

Still, according to a well-placed source in the administration, I am the only faculty member who’s been under investigation for DHR (discrimination, harassment, or retaliation) this past year, and as of October 16, 2015, I am the only faculty member in recent memory to be facing “disciplinary sanction.”

I was found guilty of a brand new crime that appears nowhere in the pertinent executive order (CSU EO 1074)—“retaliatory acts”—after an investigation that lasted 378 days. According to the Collective Bargaining Agreement, Article 19, the three options for disciplinary action consist of suspension without pay, demotion, or dismissal. That’s a whole lot of suck, like choosing between arsenic, cyanide, or strychnine.

Yes, dismissal. I may be a rare case—it is fully within the realm of possibility—of a professor being stripped of tenure and fired, like John McAdams of Marquette University, due to allegations of anti-gay bias. By the way, I’m a bisexual man married to a woman, the mother of my two children.

Conservativeness Negates All Underprivileged Points

With me there’s always a catch, a rub, a wild card factor. Although I embody everything social justice warriors claim to fight for, I also inherited from my left-wing lesbian mother a dogged refusal to dissemble. I am what I am, and I don’t like closets, masks, or phony avatars. I’m conservative through and through. I can’t pretend to be anything else. The world doesn’t know what to do with that.

Although I embody everything social justice warriors claim to fight for, I also inherited from my left-wing lesbian mother a dogged refusal to dissemble.

You’ve probably seen the image of the screaming black woman, a Yale student, beefing with the “master” of Silliman College. You’ve probably seen the image of the screaming white woman, a professor, beefing with a hapless Asian student trying to take pictures of a public event. Maybe you’ve also heard from Breitbart or The Daily Caller about my little kerfuffle involving the Ronald Reagan Library, a KKK reference, a bloodthirsty Title IX coordinator, and a student who nabbed me on charges of “retaliation” because I didn’t nominate her for an award she was ineligible for anyway. If you don’t know anything about my situation, read “Taxpayer-Funded Diversity Bureaucrats Hound Professor, Compare Reagan Library to KKK Camp” or check out this petition. The facts of my case will keep you pretty busy!

The problem is that if the human mind works as I suspect it does, then we process politics through identification. We see ourselves in one of the players of political drama. I am stuck here because I see myself in everyone: the angry Yale minority student, the staggered professor, the angry professor, the bullied Asian, the wounded gays, and the henpecked target of social-justice bullying. My final diagnosis: this is a horrible mess.

Exporting LGBT Politics of Destruction

Race is a mess, but nothing like gender, so let’s focus on sex. Gender politics couldn’t be weirder right now. The LGBT and feminist movements sprang from a similar source, even if there is considerable tension between them and even if there exist countless splinter factions within each. Much of what we see in these movements today ceased being funny a few years ago and began to terrify anybody who was observant. But there was a kernel of justifiable cause in the 1960s.

The same could be said, of course, of communism vis-à-vis earlier generations. The latter movement ended in disaster and provides a cautionary tale for the current crop of gender-fixated social-justice warriors. In “Jephthah’s Daughters: Innocent Casualties in the War for Family ‘Equality,’” I included these points:

The scope, depth, and purism of sexual movements may ultimately surpass the overreach and eventual implosion of the global movements for class equality. [LGBT activists] are creatures of overreach. Yet their modus operandi has ended up being even more invasive than Marxism, because what ligbitists regulate is intimate, pertaining to the pleasurable acts that were previously private.



When I am in France, I have to explain to countless Europeans why this ideology became so awful. America is to the ligbitist movement as the Soviet Union was to Communism. American universities articulated the theoretical framework for this movement in its most abstract form. Then the police state and financial power of the United States have kicked in to impose it nationwide, then globally. We can blame it partly on the Scandinavians, but honestly, how much could Sweden and Denmark have inflicted this on such a massive swath of the world? It’s Americans who unleashed this on the globe.

Many ironies surround the rise of LGBT/feminist ideology, not the least of which is the role of American exceptionalism. One could argue that the United States has been far more obnoxious about imposing its gender radicalism on the world than the Soviet Union was about forcing a vision of classless societies across the globe.

Colonizing All the Languages

The language predominantly spoken in the United States—English—is extraordinarily bereft of gender constructions compared to almost all the other languages in the world. As I learned in compiling the contributions to “Jephthah’s Daughters,” most European languages involve nouns, adjectives, and articles that adapt according to feminine, masculine, or neuter forms. Other languages beyond Europe, such as Arabic and Chinese, do not have words for “parenting” or “marriage” other than compounds of “mother-father” and “husband-wife.” The obsession with forcibly changing language to scrub gender out of everyday speech came from the United States for a very clear reason—it could only be remotely conceivable in a place that spoke English.

Welsh, Spanish, and Chinese have already been subject to imperialist pressure by English-speakers demanding that they gut their whole symbolic order.

As JD contributors Huldah Lochlan, André Jenkins, and Aphie Ng pointed out, Welsh, Spanish, and Chinese have already been subject to imperialist pressure by English-speakers demanding that they gut their whole symbolic order to keep language “safe” for transgender activists.

The bold project of trying to reorganize everything about class inequality is no greater a folly than the bold project of trying to reorganize everything in the world according to sex and gender inequality.

Boldness is at once irresistible and self-destructive to a large segment of the human race. Dreams of transformative power attract a particular type of person the more impossible the dreams are and the more proof there is of how they backfire. Hence the publication of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s “The Gulag Archipelago” in 1973 did not discourage countless radical intellectuals in the West from romanticizing communist revolution. The liberation theology that my mother espoused remained strong until her death in 1990.

The Craziness Is Increasing

Over the last several weeks, so much news has come out about the terrifying paths taken by LGBT/feminist activists that the average American could be forgiven for wondering just how bad all of this can get. Rosie O’Donnell, a lesbian, apparently kicked out her adopted daughter Chelsea, then publicly defamed her. Chelsea’s accounts exposed the harrowing tales of growing up in a lesbian celebrity household, seeming to confirm many of the dire warnings that B.N. Klein and I provided to the Supreme Court in our amicus brief last March.

The average American could be forgiven for wondering just how bad all of this can get.

Teenage boys are mandated under federal sanction to have access to naked female classmates in high school showering facilities.

The surrogacy business, sometimes called babies on demand, is needed to create all those idealized gay families with children. It has yielded countless custody nightmares, human trafficking scandals, and even deaths of hyper-drugged surrogate mothers, yet all the momentum seems to be for expanding surrogacy, particularly in gay-positive New York.

Planned Parenthood’s organ harvesting scandal sent shock waves around the nation, then fizzled out so conveniently that as recently as November 6 Whoopi Goldberg could glibly cut off Carly Fiorina on the topic, saying, “You know that’s not true.”

The Pros and Cons of Shamelessness

In the sixth and final section of “Jephthah’s Daughters,” co-editor Rivka Edelman and I compiled essays demonstrating twelve of the most powerful tools of LGBT/feminist radicalism: fraud, lies, scorn, shamelessness, faithlessness, hypocrisy, pedantry, deflections, demagoguery, McCarthyism, inhumanities, and “the siren’s song.” Each of these tools deserves its own book, but for now, I’d like to comment on “shamelessness.”

What she said was so patently ridiculous that investigators were left speechless, immobilized, and ultimately compliant.

The absence of any kind of self-critique, humility, or restraint has come across powerfully in the news over the last week, particularly when we look at what is happening on college campuses. Videos by Project Veritas revealed that the diversity officers at Vassar, Oberlin, Yale, Syracuse, and Cornell all agreed to shred or cut up copies of the U.S. Constitution to placate an actress pretending to be a spoiled and distorted undergraduate.

In a marvelous performance, the actress walks into Title IX offices at all these campuses and parrots the list of traumatic effects usually cited by activists demanding “safe spaces.” She tells the Title IX officers that she can’t sleep, she’s having trouble focusing, her vision is blurred, and she can’t do her work. The cause, she claims, is seeing the Constitution distributed on campus, since she says the Constitution is an oppressive document.

The key to this faux student’s magical powers over these seasoned professionals was her shamelessness. What she said was so patently ridiculous that investigators were left speechless, immobilized, and ultimately compliant. Her lack of shame did not discredit, but rather empowered her.

Similarly, Yale, Missouri, and Northridge found that the most shameless players in the ongoing campus diversity tragedy ended up prevailing. The ludicrousness comes not from racial history but from the history of LGBT and feminist activism, which focuses on feeling and desire to the exclusion of material practicality. In all fairness, not race but gender is driving the bus into madness.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/11/13/racism-isnt-the-problem-on-campus-gender-insanity-is/,2015-11-13
The Queer Lobby Wants To Make Comic Books Unequal,"As The New York Times recently noted, the comics world has begun to write a number of homosexual characters and books that now incorporate gay characters or interact with them in some way. It referenced the new, ongoing Midnighter, and Wonder Woman officiating a lesbian wedding.

The article also went out of its way to dive into the independent side of comics to shine a spotlight on books like “Virgil,” “Flutter,” and “Lumberjanes.” While the piece was predominantly celebrating transgender and homosexual comics, it also revealed the main goal of a social movement pushed by a number of different comic book opinion websites.

In the last paragraph, George Gene Gustines quotes Comics Alliance Editor in Chief Andrew Wheeler: “We need to get from some to enough. And really, we’ll know we’ve achieved success when Captain America can have a boyfriend, and Wonder Woman can have a girlfriend. For queer representation in superhero comics, that’s what success looks like.”

You read that right. Queer representation in comics will only be a success when the mainstream DC and Marvel characters are gay. It’s not enough that Wonder Woman is officiating lesbian weddings; she needs to be a lesbian, bisexual, or transgender herself.

This gets to the heart of their movement. They aren’t interested in good storytelling, interesting characters, or fun plot lines. They are more interested in identity politics and whether the big Marvel or DC characters identify with their cause and vision of what comics should be. They are willing to sacrifice quality in favor of this vision.

There Can Be No Legitimate Opposition

Thomas Sowell’s “The Vision of the Anointed” succinctly addresses this approach. Now, Sowell’s book is targeted more towards public policy, but it can also be used to examine cultural phenomena. Sowell notes there are four key elements common to the prevailing vision of the anointed at any given time. They are:

Assertions of a great danger to the whole of society, a danger to which the masses of people are oblivious. An urgent need for action to avert impending catastrophe. A need for government to drastically curtail the dangerous behavior of the many, in response to the prescient conclusions of the few. A disdainful dismissal of arguments to the contrary as either uninformed, irresponsible, or motivated by unworthy purposes.

These four elements are also found within the social justice movement to transform comics. The first can be seen in the recent Batgirl cover controversy. The cover depicts The Joker with his arm around Barbara Gordon in homage to Alan Moore’s “The Killing Joke.” Brett Schenker of Graphic Policy described it as “continued victimization and fridging.” However, anyone outside the comic world could care less about this one single image, let alone it representing some kind of victimization and fridging of women.

If the comic wasn’t immediately pulled from the stands, they charged it would promote transphobic behavior such as murder.

The second and third elements are also seen in Graphic Policy’s response to the second issue of “Airboy.” They were so completely appalled by the comic, they issued a call for the publisher to remove it from publication for being “transphobic.” If the comic wasn’t immediately pulled from the stands, they charged it would promote transphobic behavior such as murder.

Finally, the fourth element shows up almost anywhere there is a dissenting opinion to the social justice crowd, and it does not always come off as disdainful. Instead, it is usually championed as something morally good, written or said in a way that does not even allow challenge. It is dogmatic.

One specific example occurred in a Wired article discussing the Marvel hip-hop variant controversy. C. Spike Trotman declared, “Diversity is legitimacy. It’s sincerity. It’s truthiness, to borrow a certain expression.” You have already been painted into a corner if you try to argue this statement. Diversity is truthiness, so if you critique it or offer a different point of view, it is obviously falsiness. (Yeah, that was a terrible joke. Should have hired Man vs. Rock.)

LGBT Characters and Themes Are Representative

While the prevailing visions hold to these common elements, they also hold something else in common with the social justice movement: the lack of evidence to support their vision. In my short time covering the comics industry, I have yet to see an analysis detailing how many characters in specific universes are gay, transgender, or whatever other diversity or identity label the social justice crowd wants to use. It is always “we need more diversity and representation” despite the number of LGBT individuals in the United States only being between 1.2 and 6.8 percent of the adult population.

The representation for lead characters is 5.4 percent if you remove the Scooby Doo books.

To put that in perspective, DC is putting out 57 comics in March, two of which are non-Superhero Scooby-Doo books. “Midnighter” features a gay lead, “Constantine: The Hellblazer” features a bisexual lead, and “DC Comics Bombshells” features a lesbian couple lead. The representation for lead characters is 5.4 percent if you remove the Scooby Doo books. That’s pretty right on compared to the overall population. It doesn’t provide a perfect picture, because I do not have data showing the percentage of LGBT individuals within the comic consumer base.

Despite this, we get people and websites like Andrew Wheeler and Comics Alliance complaining that the only way LGBT people will be fairly represented in comics is to essentially eradicate the straight characters.

Try Writing New Characters Instead of Morphing Old Ones

They would rather have Wonder Woman or Captain America’s sexual orientation changed than create brand new, interesting characters. Now, a number of these talking heads will cry that it is too difficult to create new characters. That is hogwash. DC is already doing this with Midnighter, who now has his own ongoing saga.

The push for diversity in comics is a vision of the anointed that is unsatisfied with representation that reflects reality.

Just a little over 20 years ago we were blessed with two of the most popular characters right now with Deadpool, who is getting his own movie in two short months, and Harley Quinn, who looks to have a very prominent role in the upcoming “Suicide Squad” movie. Gustines’ own article details a number of independent books that have created original characters that are finding fantastic success. It’s quite possible they might get their own movie or television show sometime in the future!

Despite evidence to the contrary, the push for diversity in comics is a vision of the anointed that is unsatisfied with representation that reflects reality. They are so dogmatic in their belief that they are underrepresented they will only feel satisfied when they have changed popular and mainstream characters’ sexual orientation or gender.

Based on their history of complaints, however, this will not satisfy them. They will find something else that must be changed because it doesn’t fit their vision of society.

One thing is clear: These complainers are confident in their ability to change comic culture and are now openly admitting their goals to continue to change characters. The question is, what are you going to do about it?

Have We Finally Reached Peak Transgender?,"State and local lawmakers across the country are dealing with a barrage of proposals about whether men and boys claiming to be transgender will get legal cover to force their way into both public and privately owned bathrooms and showers with women and girls.

For the 2016 spring Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, officials have indicated they will allow a man who is still packing his “tools” to compete as a female if he has low testosterone and claims to be a female. Under the new Olympic standard, a man with low T can now compete equally with biologically correct females even with all his male parts intact.

Future Olympic competitions could look more like a “Saturday Night Live” skit than a world-class athletic event. I hope the biologically correct females open a can of “whoop-up” on the low-T guys.

On Television, Too Much LGBT

On almost every television network, the preponderance of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) characters and storylines is inescapable, almost to the point of saturation, even though it’s completely out of proportion to the real-world LGBT population of an estimated 3.4 percent.

Six transgender-community-related shows are on the air right now. Terri Ryan, a TV producer and advocate for the cross-dressing community, in Huffington Post asked questions that suggest even an advocate working in the entertainment industry may be uncomfortable with the current over-exposure of transgenders on TV:

Are there too many TV shows depicting transgender people? Is it just too much at one time for an audience to absorb? Are we in the TG community attempting to force acceptance through highly scripted and well-staged reality shows that may or may not be representing the majority of the TG community? Will having so many transgender topic shows educate or turn off the very people they are attempting to appeal to, because it is too much, too soon?

Arguing that gays and transgenders are ignored or oppressed falls flat on its face these days. Gay, lesbian, and transgender characters are often shown in a pathetic or sympathetic light—abused, oppressed, or mistreated—in an effort to make the viewer more open to them and feel sorry for them. But they are not abused. They are our Olympic athletes and TV stars.

The Transgender Push Is Purposeful and Planned

Is it deliberate? Yes. The push to normalize LGBT characters has become all too predictable. We’re in the midst of a major, deliberate, well-executed social indoctrination coming from the entertainment industry, the White House, and pro-trans LGBT activists.

Since 2006, the Gay Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) has evaluated the quantity and quality of LGBT characters during primetime television. Their annual report, the Network Responsibility Index, ranks the networks in a type of scorecard. Their objective is to push for positive representation and to increase the amount of representation. “TV hasn’t merely reflected the changes in social attitudes; it has also had an important role in bringing them about,” said the

2013 Network Responsibility Index.

The 2015 rankings and score, based on percentage of LGBT-inclusive original programming hours during primetime, show this programming is at an all-time high on broadcast and cable networks.

LGBT people comprise only 3.4 percent of the population, yet the advocate organization GLAAD considers 28 percent of programming as merely “adequate” and 8 percent as “failing.” GLAAD has met with top network executives at networks to discuss how TV can “improve.”

Television Networks’ Political Connections

When these folks get together for LGBT advocates to set TV programming, they’re not so much negotiating as they are strategizing in unison. This is evident from the deep personal affiliations between the LGBT-driven Obama White House and many top TV executives.

Pillow talk and sibling connections can be powerful influences to inspire the networks to support the White House agenda. An article at Breitbart.com explored the many personal connections between White House staffers and network honchos in 2013:

White House national security advisor Ben Rhoades is the brother of David Rhoades, president of CBS News.

Press Secretary Jay Carney is married to Claire Shipman, a senior national correspondent at ABC News.

Special advisor to the president Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall is the sister of Ben Sherwood, president of ABC News.

Former House Deputy Secretary of State Tom Nides is married to Virginia Moseley, CNN’s vice president and Washington bureau chief.

These network execs spend time with family and professional connections who might as well themselves be LGBT advocates. It’s no secret that the White House celebrates gay and transgender causes. President Obama uses the power and influence of the “bully pulpit” to get behind the LGBT agenda. In fact, the White House now considers itself to be a medical expert, weighing in on whether certain psychotherapies for lesbian, gay, and transgender people are effective.

When the Supreme Court ruled in favor of gay marriage, the White House “spiked the ball” by blazing an LGBT rainbow across the face of the building. On its website, the White House has a special section dedicated to “President Obama and the LGBT Community.”

The current administration has appointed more than 250 openly LGBT people to full-time and advisory positions in the executive branch, several of them openly transgender. The Obama administration hired the first transgender to White House staff: LGBT activist Raffi Freeman-Gurspan. In November 2015, only four short months after Freeman-Gurspan started working in the West Wing, the White House announced it was prepared to amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to sexual orientation and gender identity, effectively turning sexual preference and gender identity confusion into a civil rights issue.

Why You’ll Never See a Formerly Gay Hero

LGBT staffers in the executive branch greatly influence the positions that the White House takes on issues and the positions the White House professes profoundly influence American social values, policy, and legislation. This overbearing media and activist push is not favorable to freedom of speech, nor is it an organic social development. The LGBT lobby is small in numbers but has enormous financial and political power.

This overbearing media and activist push is not favorable to freedom of speech, nor is it an organic social development.

No network will ever get approval from GLAAD to feature a script about a homosexual, lesbian, or transgender who changed his or her life after undergoing sound psychotherapy and found freedom from the lifestyle he or she once loved.

When I speak at conferences around the country, I hear speakers who had been gay, lesbian, or transgender. They share their personal stories of coming out of the homosexual life and transgender delusions. Airing realistic underdog stories such as these, of people who are conflicted about being gay or transgender and want to leave the lifestyle, won’t win a GLAAD “excellent” rating or any Screen Actors Guild awards. It won’t ever get aired.

To pre-empt the wackos who might line up to bash me for my remarks, I’ll share some of my history to demonstrate that I’m not homophobic or transphobic. During the years I was living my transgender life, for a time I lived in West Los Angeles in a large house owned by my Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, a homosexual. He shared his home with men like me who were in early recovery from drugs and alcohol. All of them were homosexual except for me.

We lived together, often sharing dinner and social times, and attending AA meetings together. I lived in the community. Like TV producer Terri Ryan, I say the level of attention on transgender and gay characters and storylines on television is too much.

Protections for Some but Not Others

Think about it. We live in an era when people are encouraged to “select a gender” with not two choices, but a spectrum of “fluidity.” Laws are being stretched to accommodate new extremes and trample the rights of anyone who doesn’t comply.

Obama pushes to accommodate the demands of these men at the expense of girls and women.

These advocates want any boy or man, whether gender-confused or a sexual pervert, to have free access to a female-specific bathroom or locker room by simply saying he identifies as a woman. Obama pushes to accommodate the demands of these men at the expense of girls and women.

New York City has gone even further in its anti-discrimination law, to regulate what must be spoken. According to the December 2015 clarification of the New York City Human Rights Law, employers, landlords, and public accommodations are required to use a person’s preferred name and pronoun, “regardless of the individual’s sex assigned at birth, anatomy, gender, medical history, appearance, or the sex indicated on the individual’s identification” or be subject to civil penalties. “The Commission can impose civil penalties up to $125,000 for violations, and up to $250,000 for violations that are the result of willful, wanton, or malicious conduct.”

Ignorant Cheerleading Means More Suffering People

I lived the delusional transgender life for eight years, and I can tell you: the LGBT lobby is serving us a boatload of pure malarkey. I hear from transgenders who needed psychological help but instead were put on the surgical slice-and-dice assembly line and now live with the awful consequences. Transgenders attempt suicide at a rate higher than 40 percent and, as I’ve reported elsewhere, studies show that more than 60 percent of transgenders have co-existing mental disorders.

The entertainment industry refuses to include in their scripts an accurate portrayal of the mental illness and the suicides prevalent in the LGBT population.

I’m concerned about the people who are not getting appropriate psychological care and end up committing suicide. Meanwhile, the entertainment industry refuses to include in their scripts an accurate portrayal of the mental illness and the suicides prevalent in the LGBT population. The White House focuses on so-called civil rights rather than mental health. These special-interest groups refuse to acknowledge that mental disorders have become the largest single risk factor in the high suicidal behavior within the lesbian, gay, and bisexual community.

The scariest and most feared persons to the LGBT sympathizers are the ones who once lived “the life” but now realize they were not born to that lifestyle and wholeheartedly reject it. I do not hate the LGBT. I just hate the mess that buying into their lifestyle made of my life.

The Transgender War Against Human Rights,"LGBT activists are terrified that South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard will follow his legislature’s lead in refusing to succumb to the high-pressure conformity tactics they’ve used to cow many other politicians. If Daugaard signs House Bill 1008, his state will be the first to secure men, women, and young children’s rights to use locker rooms and bathrooms free from the eyes and presence of people who are biologically of the opposite sex.

So LGBT groups are spewing forth even more of their usual overhyped invective. The laughably named Human Rights Campaign has been sending forth feverish press releases imperiously demanding that men be allowed to shower in the same area as little girls, lest children be endangered. Yes, really: “These appalling proposals [to keep men out of little girls’ showers and bathrooms] would compromise the safety and well-being of the young people we all have the duty and obligation to support and protect.” A little more self-awareness, please.

More likely HRC’s urgent tone reflects the fact that many state lawmakers have this year introduced bills intended to protect women and children from finding themselves undressed next to a person of the opposite sex, with no recourse. More than two-dozen of these bills have surfaced in the past six months in states including Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, Texas, and Wisconsin. The spike in such bills is a direct response to the Obama administration last year forcing public schools in Illinois and Virginia to put boys in girls’ dressing, bathroom, and shower facilities, or lose federal K-12 funds. The administration will soon release a “hit list” of religious colleges that similarly protect sexual privacy.

Transgender: A Bridge Too Far

Many lawmakers find forcing little girls to undress next to men and boys too intolerant for even their heavily conditioned tastes, as this report from a debate in Indiana shows: “The ‘T’ (in LGBT) is a stumbling block at the moment,” [Senate President David] Long said…Democrats refused to support a proposal that did not include civil rights protections for transgender Hoosiers. But Republicans refused to support a proposal that included them.” LGBT activists’ refusal to compromise in red-state Indiana on forcibly injecting transgender men into women and children’s bathrooms this month tanked a broader special-rights bill for a stack of their preferred sexual minorities.

‘The “T” (in LGBT) is a stumbling block at the moment,’ [Senate President David] Long said.’

These lawmakers’ common-sense stance was totally non-controversial about a year ago. Now all of a sudden schools that have boys’ and girls’ bathrooms are being propagandized as “extremist.” Why the rush? Because this logical extension of the LGBT agenda is so obviously anti-reality that to succeed they must push it through, fast and furiously. In this case, the method is to smear the legislators and the vast majority of South Dakotans they represent, claiming they are “attacking transgender children.”

Nothing is further from the truth. South Dakotan legislators and their compatriots across the country are standing up, both to protect the vulnerable women and children of America who comprise a majority of the population and to protect rights for everyone that are far more important than forcibly rearranging private spaces to accommodate feelings that are probably best resolved through psychotherapy, not enabling self- and other-abuse.

Here’s how these “bathroom bills” show that the LGBT political agenda ultimately degrades human rights, suppresses scientific truths, and ends government by consent.

The Fundamental Rights to Free Speech and Association

If the LGBT lobby had an accurate vision statement, it would probably read something like this: “No one shall speak freely to another human being.” If that sounds a bit odd to you, then consider how ferociously the LGBT lobby has been fighting free expression.

It has become quickly clear that the LGBT lobby was merely using Americans’ love of freedom against us.

On the heels of the Supreme Court Obergefell decision that forced states to legally sanction same-sex marriage, we have seen a flurry of censorship laws disguised as sexual orientation and gender identity non-discrimination (SOGI) laws. They’re the sort of laws that can result in a $250,000 fine in New York if you “misgender” a transgender person. They can also shut down your business and bank accounts if you politely recuse yourself from applying your artistic talents—whether in flower arranging, cake designing, or photography—to celebrating a same-sex wedding.

The vitriolic reaction of the LGBT lobby to honesty from Americans about their consciences, religious beliefs, scientific knowledge, and political stances shows that their agenda boils down to shutting down free speech. This sounds counter-intuitive. After all, the media and Hollywood conditioned us in pre-Obergefell days to see gay rights and transgenderism as an expansion of free expression, certainly not its death knell. LGBT agitation and propaganda trained us to see it all as a matter of simply allowing people to be their authentic selves. Not as a tool to enforce conformity of thought on all of us, thereby erasing authenticity.

But it has become quickly clear that the LGBT lobby was merely using Americans’ love of freedom against us. They were packaging speech bans and economic conscription inside the stars and stripes. Their favored laws prioritize the ability of a tiny minority to compel everyone else to affirm their desires over everyone’s ability to discuss the issue honestly. Remember: transgender folks comprise 0.03 percent of the U.S. population, while children and adult women comprise some 62 percent.

We all know that disagreeing with someone does not mean hating them. It means that an issue is open for discussion.

When put that way, most Americans will disagree. So they have to be barred from discussion with smears of “bigotry” and “hate.” But we all know that disagreeing with someone does not mean hating them. It means that an issue is open for discussion, that’s all. If it cannot be open for discussion, we have now entered a totalitarian state in which people’s private thoughts and actions are now grounds for political control.

The horrors repression at this level sparks are precisely why the rights to free speech and association are enshrined in our Constitution, while rights to others’ good opinion and cooperation are not. Free speech is more important than protecting feelings, because without the former a free society cannot exist.

Children’s Right to Be Secure from Exploitation

HRC press releases rather absurdly insist that bills like those in South Dakota are “vile” and “serve[] no other purpose than to directly attack transgender children and could have catastrophic consequences.”

LGBT advocates have shown themselves especially callous about the rights of women and children to feel secure, even as they cynically wield the tiny population of so-called transgender children.

Wrong. State and national constitutions already protect these rights, and Americans have responded to the demands of transgendered children’s handlers by bending over backward to accommodate them as far as possible without also violating the privacy and speech rights of their fellow citizens. We have schools in numerous states granting private bathroom and showering facilities to transgender children (and adults), accommodating their requests to play on sports teams of the opposite sex, and shushing up all the other children to protect one child’s feelings.

If LGBT advocates were really concerned about “singling [transgender children] out from their peers,” as HRC insisted the South Dakota bill does, they would not push these children into pre-puberty cross-sex hormones and demand that parents encourage them to dress and act abnormally. They would not call for and get the heads of prominent and respected doctors who merely note that research shows the best care for transgender children does not push them into opposite-sex behaviors and chemicals.

LGBT advocates have shown themselves especially callous about the rights of women and children to feel secure, even as they cynically wield the tiny population of so-called transgender children as sympathetic excuses to enact their anti-science, anti-speech, and anti-empathy agenda. It can be possible for individual schools and public places to protect both gender-confused individuals and the rest of society, typically by granting both private places to conduct their private business.

They don’t want good-faith compromises. They want dominance.

But that’s not good enough for LGBT advocates, because they don’t want good-faith compromises. They want dominance. They benefit from not only expanding the number of gender-confused children so they can multiply their legal beachheads, but also from instantly politicizing each child’s case to prevent families from privately dealing with these conflicts in a manner that may provide wholeness by coming to peace with the biological sex of the child in question, as the vast majority of successful transgender-child cases do. In other words, LGBT advocates (whose agenda and tactics many homosexual and transgender people do not support) score political points by exploiting and damaging not only non-transgender children but also the very children they pretend to champion.

The Right to Act with Authenticity and Integrity

South Dakota has another bill, House Bill 1107, that is aptly titled “An Act to Ensure Government Nondiscrimination in Matters of Religious Beliefs and Moral Convictions.” In other words, if you have serious beliefs about sex, marriage, and children, you needn’t be forced to perform acts that violate your conscience or totally gag yourself in fear of being fired.

South Dakota lawmakers are issuing a friendly reminder that the First Amendment guarantees freedom of belief and freedom of speech for everybody.

You can hold ideas about marriage that nearly all of the world’s major religions teach and that 99 percent of the world’s population accepted until approximately 18 months ago when—voila!—the media declared that the masses have changed their collective mind. Or you can hold to the anti-science LGBT diktat that obliterates the meaning of male or female for everybody on the planet (because it insists everybody’s sex is arbitrarily “assigned at birth”). Both perspectives would be protected.

That’s called freedom of conscience. Protecting it allows people to publicly act the same as they privately think. That’s called integrity, and authenticity. The LGBT agenda instead pressures people to act like hypocrites because they fear losing social status. South Dakota lawmakers are issuing a friendly reminder that the First Amendment guarantees freedom of belief and freedom of speech for everybody, not just LGBT folks and their allies.

The Transgender Agenda Is Anti-Science

The heart of South Dakota’s HB 1107 states the following:

the state may not take any discriminatory action against a person, wholly or partially, on the basis that the person believes, speaks, or acts in accordance with a sincerely held religious belief or moral conviction that;

Marriage is or should only be recognized as the union of one man and one woman;

Sexual relations are properly reserved to marriage; or

The terms male or man and female or woman refer to distinct and immutable biological sexes that are determined by anatomy and genetics by the time of birth.

The HRC seeks to make expressing all of the above beliefs illegal. Here’s the kicker: that ultimately includes any statement in which you would recognize the biological reality of your own body.

The LGBT agenda is nothing less than a war on reality. Essentially, it requires that everybody get with a legal package deal that insists human beings are neither male nor female. The transgender piece of it absolutely requires this. Remember, it’s based on the premise that your “gender” (which is a linguistic, not scientific, term) is arbitrarily “assigned at birth,” never a fact of physical reality, such as the basic truth that all human beings, except the tiny percentage with genetic anomalies, have either XX or XY chromosomes imprinted on every single cell of their bodies.

Gender is not assigned at birth, because a person’s sex is permanent.

This is biology 101 that every school worth the name teaches at least in high school. And it means that gender is not assigned at birth, because a person’s sex is permanent. It’s inherent to each individual human from the first second that sperm and egg fuse. No amount of social shaming can change this basic fact of life. Scholar Daniel Moody has dissected this fallacy of gender theory in an insightful blog post entitled “The Flesh Made Word.”

There is no logic to implementing the transgender agenda, because it inherently requires irrationally rejecting the simple, biological reality that men and women’s bodies are quite different, and that nothing can make a genetically normal person transmogrify either into the other sex or into the very small number of people whose bodies, due to genetic defects, include aspects of both sexes.

A War On Government by Consent

The headline of a HRC press release reads: “South Dakota on the Verge of Becoming First State in Nation to Pass Law Attacking Trans Children.” The quote from the HRC president reads: “This legislation is disturbing, shocking, and outrageous. It serves no other purpose than to directly attack transgender children and could have catastrophic consequences. The Senate must stop this vile legislation dead in its tracks.”

These are the smears of political correctness, which are intended to modify your language, behavior, and thoughts.

Disturbing. Shocking. Outrageous. Vile. Really? These are the smears of political correctness, which are intended to modify your language, behavior, and thoughts. This is exactly how gas lighters operate on their victims. Without suppressing dissent, the entire transgender project would die in its tracks, just like any other cult project. The LGBT lobby knows this.

Instead, it can only operate within a Stalinist-style framework. It’s totally about agitprop. Marshall Kirk and Hunter Madsen laid out the whole strategy for the LGBT agenda in their 1989 book “After the Ball.” They prescribed a hardcore propaganda and marketing campaign that utilized depth psychology. It’s classic thought reform, which can be applied to get people to believe anything, no matter how implausible.

Their prescription was to first de-sensitize the public. Then to “jam” or suppress every word of dissent. Finally, everyone must convert. This cultivates a conditioned population. Once we are conditioned in this manner, we end up accepting agendas and programs that we’d at least question if our society respected clear and free thinking. Instead, people either self-censor or conform to the party line out of hope for social acceptance.

Representative government requires citizens to be able to openly discuss social questions among themselves.

That’s how it works in places like North Korea, anyway. We’re getting there, thanks to purveyors of censorship under the guise of “non-discrimination.” It’s entirely opposite to how American-style government is supposed to work. Representative government requires the citizens, who are themselves the source of our government’s authority, to be able to openly discuss social questions among themselves and consequently direct their representatives.

If we are afraid or taught not to speak, representative government cannot happen. Tiny factions like the LGBT lobby wield power over an unwilling populace, which breeds resentment against government for not aligning with our priorities. Political correctness therefore eviscerates government by consent; under it, government operates based on brute force, which escalates public disapproval in a constant cycle until the social repression is broken—sometimes with (God forbid) violence.

What Happens Next?

The great irony of the gay rights agenda is that, ultimately, it’s not about gay rights or transgender rights. They always follow censorship with further centralized power in the state.

This stunts our growth because it causes people to become more polarized and fearful about sharing perspectives.

Using law to suppress free speech in the name of equality is characteristic of the urge to use centralized state power to promote unique and, frankly, warped agendas. This sort of equality requires having resentments to cultivate and victims to exploit—and state power that “protects” said victims by suppressing all opposing points of view.

The risks inherent in this are deep and frightening. State power feeds on itself. Lenin exploited workers and Mao exploited the peasants, all in the guise of being their “vanguard” and giving them equality. Anyone at the HRC who truly loves freedom will come to rue the day it yielded to the urge to use state power to suppress free expression in the name of equality for gays and transgenders.

This latest attack against the First Amendment is unquestionably another act of war against freedom of conscience and expression. That makes it a campaign against human rights. By killing freedom of religion and speech, it also kills freedom of association. It stunts our growth because it causes people to become more polarized and fearful about sharing perspectives. That’s perfect for a centralized surveillance state. But it’s tragic for true human friendship and love.

South Dakota’s Gov. Tucks Tail And Runs From LGBT Mafia,"South Dakota’s Dennis Daugaard is the latest in a string of craven Republican governors to bow down to the gay mafia and the corporate cronies it controls. The other day Daugaard vetoed legislation that would have allowed the state’s public schools to continue the standard practice of separate bathroom and locker room facilities for males and females.

Next on the hit list is Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, who is having the language changed in legislation meant to protect freedom of conscience for citizens whose beliefs about marriage or sex don’t align with the beliefs assigned by the gay mafia.

This domino effect began in 2014, when Arizona’s Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act her legislature passed. Later, Gov. Mike Pence got a serious case of the wobblies after signing a RFRA into law in Indiana. He was stunned to see mobilized masses converged on the statehouse screaming bloody murder at the thought that people would be permitted not to violate their consciences about marriage or sex while trying to make a living in the United States of America.

LGBT-infused corporate cronyism no doubt played an even bigger role behind the scenes. Threats of boycotts and tanking the state’s economy took their toll very quickly and Pence folded like a lousy poker hand. Within days, he scrapped that bill, then had the language neutered so it would read instead like one of those aggressive censorship laws that go under the guise of “sexual orientation and gender identity anti-discrimination” (SOGI) laws.

In South Dakota, LGBT lobbyists not only used corporate pressure, but also stoked resentments and high emotions throughout the media, calling the bill a “vile” attack on transgender students. At the same time, transgender activists made a point of setting up a passive-aggressive schmooze session with Daugaard, after which he signaled his intent to veto the bill by saying he “saw things through their eyes.” Of course, transgender celebrities Caitlyn Jenner and Laverne Fox pitched in to the chorus.

Daugaard Promises Local Control, Delivers Opposite

Daugaard’s veto against maintaining common-sense accommodations for student privacy contains some pretty distorted reasoning. He claimed to be protecting local control of school districts at a time when federal meddling into local control is at its peak, particularly concerning all things LGBT. His veto message reads in part:

House Bill 1008 does not address any pressing issue concerning the school districts of South Dakota. As policymakers in South Dakota, we often recite that the best government is the government closest to the people. Local school districts can, and have, made necessary restroom and locker room accommodations that serve the best interests of all students, regardless of biological sex or gender identity.



This bill seeks to impose statewide standards on ‘every restroom, locker room, and shower room located in a public elementary or secondary school.’ It removes the ability of local school districts to determine the most appropriate accommodations for their individual students and replaces that flexibility with a state mandate.

This is nonsense, of course. The entire point of the legislation was to anticipate and pre-empt the federal mandate that is clearly coming down the pike to force every single local school district in every single state to destroy accommodations that maintain the privacy of all biological female and all biological male school children.

So, under the disingenuous claim of preserving local government, Daugaard’s veto actually ensures that federal law will trump local self-determination. The Justice Department has already declared that the term “sex” in Title VII of the 1964 civil rights law will henceforth be interpreted to include gender identity.

There is also the threat of losing federal funding that looms for any local district that doesn’t comply. The Fairfax County School Board in Virginia passed its gender identity policy last year by a vote of 10-1, in total contempt of the strenuous objections of parents, and under heavy federal pressure. The feds have also moved in on other local school districts on this issue, such as a high-profile case outside Chicago.

3 Things about Transgender Law Politicians Don’t Get

Here are three other main features of transgender law that politicians just don’t get.

The ultimate goal of transgender law is not to protect transgender individuals, but to legally define human beings as sexless. The dead giveaway here is the transgender movement’s constant use of the phrase “gender assigned at birth.” It defines gender identity basically as a person’s self-perception of his or her “gender,” whether or not it aligns with his or her “sex assigned at birth.”

‘Gender identity’ exists only in one’s mind, not in physical reality.

This is a non-negotiable premise written into all policies and laws the transgender lobby push. It applies universally, and legally replaces everybody’s sex with the ambiguous term “gender identity.” And “gender identity” exists only in one’s mind, not in physical reality. This means, for example, that Daugaard identifies as male only because in his mind he thinks he’s male. Since the gender identity scheme will ultimately abolish all biological sex distinctions in law, it has implications for family autonomy that are vast and grim.

Transgenderism is ultimately about central planning and centralized government, not about protecting the transgender individuals it is currently exploiting for that purpose. Transgenderism is the perfect vehicle to enhance and grow the power of the state. As we cede our right to identify as biologically male or female—and this concession is an inherent, though stealth, demand of transgender laws and all SOGI laws—government will gain more raw power to regulate family relationships because it now claims the power to decide what we are and are not.

Censorship always comes with the transgender territory. Always. Sustaining the illusions of the transgender project is a full-time job. This is why aggressive censorship and propaganda are such an inherent part of the transgender movement. It’s a war on privacy, on personal identity, on language, on personal relationships, and on reality itself. So it cannot abide even a whisper of dissent. This is why freedom of conscience is so often a target, under the guise of anti-discrimination.

LGBT Tactics Look a Lot Like Mafia Tactics

The LGBT alignment with government-induced corporate cronyism illustrates that we live in an era of mafia government. If you see this happening, you’re probably not surprised to see GOP governors cave to opponents of religious freedom bills or common-sense legislation to protect personal privacy, particularly that of young girls.

It now has a massive list of corporations that have agreed to comply after facing threats to their ability to do business.

Joy Pullmann wrote a fascinating 2014 essay for The Federalist entitled “The Age of Mafia Government.” It illustrates how the White House has been using federal agencies and corporations to intimidate and destroy potential opponents of its pet agendas, all of which involve centralizing state power. President Obama has given the LGBT agenda a pre-eminent place, even including it in the National Security Strategy last year. So it stands to reason that the feds would play a huge role, at least behind the scenes, in knocking down any legislation that could get in the way.

Of course the LGBT lobby has been aggressively infusing its agenda into the policies of human resources departments of major corporations for several decades. It now has a massive list of corporations that have agreed to comply after facing threats to their ability to do business. Sounds more than a tad like extortion, no?

In Georgia alone, where the legislature is considering a religious freedom bill, you can check this list of over 400 corporations that have essentially pledged to reject any legislation deemed unacceptable to the gay mafia, meaning any that allows for freedom of conscience on issues of marriage, sex, and gender identity.

Government Co-opts Business Co-opts Government

Corporate cronyism like this has bloated to such a degree that it’s fair to ask further: who knows how much public money has been funneled into activist causes like this? We can only wonder after looking at Washington Examiner’s recently published cover story, “Obama’s Slush Fund.” In it you can read how Bank of America and Citigroup made a deal with the Justice Department to reduce their penalties in financial fraud cases.

The banks can reduce their penalties by hundreds of millions while donating same to leftist causes. It all sounds a tad like racketeering, no?

How? They got double credit toward their penalties by donating to administration-approved nonprofit organizations. The banks donate directly, of course, because it’s not legal for the government to do so. In the end, the banks can reduce their penalties by hundreds of millions while donating same to leftist causes. It all sounds a tad like racketeering, no?

The bottom line is that it will take real courage to stop the machine of government abuse of power, a machine the gay mafia has such a hand in promoting. GOP governors who refuse to respect the will of the majority of the people of their states by caving to LGBT tactics of extortion may think they are protecting their state’s economy and reputation. They may even feel gratification when the mafia pats them on the back for cooperating, and congratulates them for “nothing happening” to the nice state they got there.

But that will prove to be nothing but a temporary illusion for those governors and their states. And as such things always go, the children will suffer the most.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/03/03/south-dakotas-governor-tucks-tail-and-runs-from-lgbt-mafia/,2016-03-03
A User’s Guide To Free Expression And Bathroom Sanity,"Following the Supreme Court’s decision redefining marriage, LGBT activists shifted their focus to the “T” in LGBT and to eliminating any dissent on marriage. At the federal, state, and local levels, the cultural Left has proposed using government coercion—in the forms of fines, penalties, and regulation—to make all Americans accept a new orthodoxy on sexuality: Boys must be allowed unfettered access to girls’ bathrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities; bakers must bake same-sex wedding cakes.

Meanwhile, big business and special interest lobbyists have denounced attempts to limit these initiatives. Republican governors such as Mike Pence of Indiana and Dennis Daugaard of South Dakota have caved to media hysterics and cultural cronyism. Pence watered down his state’s religious freedom law; Daugaard vetoed a bill that would have accommodated transgender students, but not allowed boys in girls’ bathrooms.

My recent book, “Truth Overruled: The Future of Marriage and Religious Freedom,” discusses these phenomena in detail. Here are the Cliff’s notes on four types of laws to keep an eye on.

1. Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Laws

These laws have been used to penalize bakers, florists, photographers, and adoption agencies. There is no federal Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) law, and most states and cities don’t have them yet. But LGBT activists are pushing to pass them across the country.

The proposed Equality Act would add “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” to more or less every federal civil rights law that protects on the basis of race, expanding them beyond their current reach and explicitly reducing current religious liberty protections. If made law, the Equality Act would have government treat people who believe we are created male and female, and that male and female are created for each other, as if they were racists.

The Equality Act would have government treat people who believe we are created male and female, and that male and female are created for each other, as if they were racists.

SOGI laws also force schools, businesses, restaurants, and other places open to the public to allow biological males who identify as women into the ladies’ restrooms. This tramples private property rights, which would say whoever owns the bathroom should be able to set the bathroom policies, be they sex-specific, unisex, or something else. Government shouldn’t force owners to grant unfettered bathroom access based on gender identity, regardless of the safety, privacy, or modesty concerns of owners, employees, and patrons.

Thankfully, citizens are pushing back. When the Houston city council voted to impose a municipal SOGI law, Houstonians organized and collected more than enough signatures to put the issue to a vote of the people. In November, 61 percent of voters resoundingly rejected it. And don’t let the media tell you it’s a city of bigots. Houstonians have elected Annise Parker, a lesbian, as mayor three times. But they drew the line at SOGI and won despite threats of boycotts and retaliation from big business (which proved empty).

Earlier this year a proposed sexual orientation bill died in the Indiana statehouse, partly because its supporters couldn’t stop fighting over the specifics. Gender identity wasn’t specifically included in the bill, SB 344, which made the LGBT lobby unhappy. Moreover, in a bid to broaden support, the bill’s authors tacked on limited religious exemptions as a “compromise.” The prospect of any religious exemptions upset many in the LGBT lobby. In their view, no one should be free to follow his beliefs about marriage in public life if it violates LGBT dogma.

SOGI laws increase cultural tensions, further empower an already powerful special-interest lobby, and impose unjustly on people of many different faiths. At the end of the day, they are both unnecessary and a threat to religious freedom.

2. Bathroom Privacy and Accommodation Laws

SOGI laws are the problem. But what are some of the solutions? One answer is to protect privacy at the bathroom and accommodate transgender students. But LGBT activists don’t like this at all.

Their official policy is that boys who identify as girls should have unfettered access to girls’ bathrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities. Anything less than full access to the bathroom and locker room of their choice is, they say, a transphobic denial of civil rights and equality. This extreme position is out of step with the majority of Americans, and utterly inconsiderate of the concerns of the non-transgendered community.

One answer is to protect privacy at the bathroom and accommodate transgender students. But LGBT activists don’t like this at all.

Earlier this year South Dakota crafted an even-handed policy respectful of everyone’s interests. Unfortunately, the governor caved to special interest hysterics. The South Dakota bill would have prevented biological males who identify as girls from using girls’ private facilities in public schools, but it also would have required local school officials to make reasonable accommodations for such students, such as providing access to single-occupancy facilities. A win-win arrangement for everyone, it would have protected all students’ privacy and safety and created new accommodations for transgender students.

Ask yourself: Why do we have gender-specific locker rooms in the first place? It’s because of biology, not because of “gender identity.” Separate facilities reflect the fact that men and women have bodily differences; they are designed to protect privacy related to our bodies. So the South Dakota bill continued the bathroom policy America has always had, while also requiring local schools to find reasonable accommodations for transgender students.

But LGBT activists accused attacked the state of “transphobia.” And big businesses threatened boycotts. As the bill reached the governor’s desk, the head of the Human Rights Campaign warned that “history will not treat kindly those who support this discriminatory measure.”

The nation is primed for yet another clash in the culture war—this time over school bathroom policy.

The Obama administration also wants to be on the Left side of history here. It claims that a 1972 civil rights law requires schools to allow unfettered bathroom and locker room access based on “gender identity.” In 2014, the U.S. Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights announced that Title IX—the 1972 law protecting the equal rights of women and girls in education—now required schools to allow boys who identify as girls into the girls’ bathroom. This unilateral reinterpretation of federal law cannot stand.

The nation is primed for yet another clash in the culture war—this time over school bathroom policy. The South Dakota legislature gave the entire United States an example of how to defuse controversy and craft principled public policy that creates good outcomes for everyone. It should have been signed into law.

We now need leaders to show courage and do the right thing: to stand up to the special interests and protect the rights and interests of all children.

3. Religious Freedom Restoration Acts

Historically, Americans have protected religious freedom by requiring the government to meet a burden of proof before it acts to substantially burden the free exercise of religion. This was the test that the Supreme Court applied under the First Amendment—up until 1990. When the Court turned away from that test, Congress voted in 1993 to reinstate it by passing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).

These commonsense laws place the onus on the government to justify its actions in burdening the free exercise of religion.

Championed by the ACLU and liberal senators Chuck Schumer and Ted Kennedy, it passed with 97 Senate votes and a unanimous voice vote in the House. President Bill Clinton signed it into law. RFRA bars government from substantially burdening religious exercise unless it can show a compelling interest to do so and does it through the least restrictive means possible.

Twenty-one states have implemented similar laws, and 11 more have constitutional religious liberty protections that state courts have interpreted to provide a similar level of protection. These commonsense laws place the onus on the government to justify its actions in burdening the free exercise of religion.

Over the last 20 years, RFRA-style laws have balanced the fundamental right to religious liberty with compelling government interests. They have protected Native Americans’ freedom to wear headdresses with eagle feathers, Sikhs’ freedom to wear religious head coverings in court, Muslim prisoners’ freedom to grow short beards, and Jewish inmates’ rights to kosher meals.

The federal RFRA protects against federal government violations of religious liberty; state RFRAs protect against state violations. Yet when Indiana proposed a near identical state version of RFRA last year, all hell broke loose. Similar hysterics are now erupting in Georgia and West Virginia over their RFRA proposals.

4. First Amendment Defense Acts

RFRAs create balancing tests that judges use. They protect religious exercise generally, then leave it to judges to determine if government has a compelling interest being pursued in a narrowly tailored way that justifies burdening the religious exercise in any particular case. But experience shows that ideologically driven judges can and do get it wrong. In cases where the risk of neglect or even hostility to the law by judges or government is acute, we can and should single out particular actions for protection and say government may never burden them.

The Supreme Court did not say that private schools, charities, businesses, or individuals must abandon their beliefs if they disagree, but some governments are acting as if it did.

We need both broad protection and specific protections. So, in addition to RFRA, Congress has passed a variety of laws that protect pro-life conscience. In Roe v. Wade the Supreme Court invented a right to an abortion. But after Roe Congress made clear that government cannot require a pro-life doctor or nurse to perform an abortion—that they, too, had rights that required specific protections from hostile judges and bureaucrats.

Likewise, in the Obergefell decision, the Supreme Court redefined marriage throughout America by mandating that governmental entities treat same-sex relationships as marriages. The Supreme Court did not say that private schools, charities, businesses, or individuals must abandon their beliefs if they disagree, but some governments are acting as if it did.

Indeed, there is no justification to force these entities to violate their beliefs about marriage. As Justice Anthony Kennedy noted, traditional beliefs are held “in good faith by reasonable and sincere people here and throughout the world.” Americans who believe that marriage is the union of husband and wife should continue to be free to live and work according to their convictions.

Now, state and federal legislatures should make it clear that no private person or institution should be forced to recognize or help celebrate a same-sex marriage—that is, that they have a right to believe—and live out—what they’ve always believed about marriage: that it’s the union of husband and wife.

Protecting minority rights after major social change is also a hallmark of American tolerance and pluralism.

The federal First Amendment Defense Act (FADA), and various state bills modeled on it, is a measured, reasonable, commonsense policy. It would ensure that no government agency discriminates against individuals or institutions for following their convictions about marriage as a man-woman union. For example, a government could not revoke their tax-exempt status or deny them government grants, contracts, accreditation, or licenses because of their beliefs. The bill protects freedom and pluralism in the wake of social change—embodying the best of American values.

Protecting minority rights after major social change is also a hallmark of American tolerance and pluralism. Yet as Georgia moves to enact a FADA, big business and special interests are attacking it.

This is yet another example of cultural cronyism. Businesses in Georgia were always free to embrace gay marriage—to bake wedding cakes for gay marriages and make floral arrangements for same-sex nuptials—and many do. But now activists want the government to force everyone in Georgia to do it. They’re threatening boycotts, travel bans, and relocations of businesses if the government doesn’t do as they wish.

They want to be free to operate in Georgia according to their values, but they don’t want small-business competitors to be free to operate according to theirs.

Big business—as represented by “individual corporate giants including Hilton Worldwide, Marriott and InterContinental Hotels Group,” the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, and the Georgia Hotel and Lodging Association—have all claimed the religious freedom bill would open the door to widespread discrimination.

But if every Hilton, Marriott, and InterContinental hotel in Georgia already hosts receptions for newlywed same-sex couples, why can’t Georgia protect the mom-and-pop bed-and-breakfast or local Knights of Columbus hall that has a different set of beliefs about marriage? This law doesn’t harm minority rights; it protects them in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s redefinition of marriage.

The hypocrisy of big business lobbying against the law is astounding. They want to be free to operate in Georgia according to their values, but they don’t want small-business competitors to be free to operate according to theirs. If all of the major corporations are already in favor of gay marriage, then this religious freedom law poses no threat. It merely protects the rights of those who disagree.

What to Do Now

America is in a time of transition. Courts have redefined marriage, and beliefs about human sexuality are changing. During this time, it is critical to protect the right to disagree and the civil liberties of those who speak and act in accord with what Americans had always believed about marriage—that it is the union of husband and wife.

Good public policy is needed at the local, state, and federal levels to protect cherished American values. This means SOGI laws must be defeated. Bathroom privacy and accommodation laws should be enacted. And religious freedom should be protected—with RFRAs and FADAs.

These policies would help achieve civil peace amid disagreement, maintain pluralism, and protect the rights of all Americans, regardless of what faith they may practice.

Caitlyn Jenner’s Cruz Backlash Proves Left Is The Real Bigots,"Caitlyn Jenner’s support of GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz is sending the LGBT activist community into conniptions. True to form, radical liberals prove they’re the truly bigoted ones by calling the transgender reality star a “lunatic” for praising the most conservative candidate in the race.

In an interview with The Advocate, Jenner boldly said, “I like Ted Cruz. I think he’s very conservative and a great constitutionalist and a very articulate man. I haven’t endorsed him or anything like that. But I also think, he’s an evangelical Christian, and probably one of the worst ones when it comes to trans issues.”

If Jenner thinks Cruz is weak on trans issues, then why support him? With a commitment to constitutional principles that should make establishment politicians bury their heads in shame, Jenner explains that while Democrats are “better when it comes to these types of social issues,” if we don’t have liberty, we don’t have anything. This position truly goes against the liberal grain as identity politics takes a backseat to freedom.

“Number 1, if we don’t have a country, we don’t have trans issues,” Jenner said. “We need jobs. We need a vibrant economy. I want every trans person to have a job. With $19 trillion in debt and it keeps going up, we’re spending money we don’t have. Eventually, it’s going to end. And I don’t want to see that. Socialism did not build this country. Capitalism did. Free enterprise. The people built it. And they need to be given the opportunity to build it back up.”

“Let’s say he goes on to be president,” Jenner continued, “and I have all my girls on a trans issues board to advise him on making decisions when it comes to trans issues. Isn’t that a good idea?”

That Hit the Worn-Out Outrage Button

Jenner’s comments stunned LGBT activists. One of the costars of “I Am Cait,” Jennifer Boylan, lost it, yelling “That’s a lie,” brandishing a rolled-up newspaper when Jenner indicated conservatives support minorities’ rights. “You’re living in a dream world,” Boylan shouted, then took to the blogosphere in a fit of hysteria, saying Boylan struck Jenner with the newspaper and “not ironically either. I smack her like she is a basset hound that just took a dump on the carpet,” the co-star and consultant to the show wrote. Can anyone say “trans abuse”?

Boylan’s response to Jenner’s determined commitment to conservatism was to quit the show. “Hanging out with her was infuriating. I just can’t do this. I want to go home.” Boylan ended up not quitting, but the anger still rages.

I wasn’t surprised by Caitlyn Jenner’s expression of support for Ted Cruz. I heard her say as much hour after hour this fall as I worked on her show. Everyone needs to get their mind around the fact that politically she is, like half the country, a conservative, and the sooner you get your mind around this, the angrier you can be.



The fact that she’s swooning over Ted Cruz–a bigot, a hater, and an all around dunderhead–is galling, but no more galling, to me, than a political philosophy that exclusively benefits the wealthy and leaves the rest of us to struggle. Cruz’s policies on trans rights are horrific, but not a whole lot more horrific than those of anyone else in the GOP currently running for office.

Boylan ends the rant saying it’s regrettable there’s not an operation to turn someone into a liberal. Yikes.

Other activists joined in, going after Jenner across social media, including some nasty tweets saying Jenner is a clueless, bad person who contributes to harassment and transphobic hate. Oh, the irony.

Trans Lobby Has No Idea Why Anyone Likes Freedom

Monica Roberts of TransGriot piled on, writing, “Caitlyn, while you have every right to support whoever you wish in this 2016 presidential contest, I would suggest that you not support a presidential candidate who thinks it’s sound political strategy and policy to demonize our trans younglings for political gain.” Zack Ford, an apologist for LGBT issues at Think Progress, wrote, “Caitlyn Jenner simply cannot be taken seriously as an advocate for the most disadvantaged transgender people if she’s lauding Ted Cruz in the same breath.” What a stellar champion of diversity you are.

If you don’t live in a free society, it doesn’t matter if you’re trans, straight, green, or blue.

Rachel Kramer Bussel of Salon said “Jenner’s optimism about Cruz is baffling.” She then sunk to firing personal attacks at the reality star, asking, “Are Jenner’s musings wishful thinking? A ratings grab? Her own version of lunacy? They certainly seem to have no basis in reality, considering the platform Cruz has built and the followers he’s courting.”

Bussel continues her assault by accusing Jenner of “wading into electoral politics without being clear with her viewers about what’s truly at stake.” But Jenner makes it very clear what’s at stake and grasps the truth better than anyone else on reality television: if you don’t live in a free society, it doesn’t matter if you’re trans, straight, green, or blue. Yet, according to Bussel, Jenner is the stupid one.

She also presumes to tell Jenner what to say, revealing the little regard radical liberals have for free speech. “Jenner would be better off using her voice to tell her own story and offer air time for those who don’t have the privileges she’s been afforded.” Never mind that Jenner earned many of those “privileges” (a.k.a. successes) through personal hard work and perseverance. Olympics medals don’t come easy.

We Love Diversity—That’s Why We Squash It

Instead, Jenner is dismissed and ridiculed because the star’s opinions don’t conform to a radical LGBT agenda. Unless Jenner shifts Left, the attacks will keep coming, shutting down Jenner’s freedom to speak and to support candidates based on deeply held principles, not peer pressure.

They’ll support Jenner and anyone else who believes in their hearts that their sex needs to change, but watch out if your heart tells you conservatism is what’s best.

Jenner responded to the criticism, saying people “think that now that I’ve transitioned that everything has to change. You can’t be conservative anymore. You have to be a liberal. No, I don’t believe that. I think I can keep all of my views the same ’cause I feel in my heart that’s the best way to go.”

LGBT activists aren’t tolerating that (but I thought conservatives were the intolerant ones!). They’ll support Jenner and anyone else who believes in their hearts that their sex needs to change, but watch out if your heart tells you conservatism is what’s best. That can’t be stomached. If you cling to the delusion of conservatism, you must a lunatic! The hypocrisy dripping from the pens of these people is astounding.

Not only are those who are pressuring Jenner to reject conservatism in the name of the LGBT agenda working by a double standard, they are simply wrong about Cruz being “anti-gay.” If you search all the frothing-at-the-mouth posts about how hateful, anti-gay, and homophobic Cruz is, you’ll find nothing to back up their claims. What you’ll find is someone who faithfully and consistently supports the constitutional rights of every American, whether he or she is straight, L, G, B, T, or Q.

Protecting Everyone’s Rights Isn’t Anti-Gay

What liberal activists call “anti-gay” are Cruz’s opposition to same-sex marriage based on legal arguments about the public interest of marriage as it relates to family and children in particular (a complicated argument, but hardly anti-gay) and the undeniable threat to a fundamental constitutional right—freedom of religion—that is the result of judicial activism.

Are we not free to disagree without being slandered and maligned? Where is the compassion, the tolerance, the kumbaya of liberalism?

Primarily, however, Cruz is consistent in his belief that issues such as same-sex marriage should be handled at the state level, and that it’s unconstitutional for the federal government to be involved despite what an activist court says. The same is true for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which the states should also handle.

The “New Civil Rights Movement” calls such views hateful and anti-gay, but this is really just complying with the Constitution and keeping the federal government from expanding its power—which is ultimately a threat to the freedom of us all. There’s no homophobia here. No hate. Are we not free to disagree without being slandered and maligned? Where is the compassion, the tolerance, the kumbaya of liberalism?

Finally, Cruz’s stance on transgender bathrooms (he’s against letting men who identify as women into women’s restrooms) is focused on protecting women—not because there is necessarily a threat from men who are transitioning, but because this would allow male predators to violate a woman’s and girl’s safe space. Again, you can disagree with this, but it is hardly “anti-gay.” In fact, it is decidedly pro-woman. Isn’t this a liberal value? I’ve always thought so, but evidently not. It seems the pro-LGBT agenda has transformed into a war on women.

Cruz Hates Gays So Much He Hangs Out With Them

Yet Cruz is somehow the bad guy? Nothing shows how ridiculous the claim that Cruz is “notoriously anti-gay” better than the criticism he received last year for going to a reception in New York given on his behalf by two prominent gay hoteliers. During the visit, it was reported that Cruz said he would love his daughters just as much if one of them were gay. He also said that same-sex marriage should be handled at the state level.

Cruz said he would love his daughters just as much if one of them were gay.

Painfully aware that the Manhattan reception hosted by a gay couple went against the “he’s a nasty bigot” meme, The New York Times looked for any angle it could find to get the narrative back on track. The only criticism they could come up with was he never mentioned at the reception that he was against same-sex marriage.

“It speaks volumes that The New York Times considers it newsworthy that a Republican who believes marriage is between a man and a woman would meet with people who hold a different view,” Cruz responded in a statement. The senator added that attending the Manhattan reception, which was focused on national security, proves he’s a “big tent Republican.”

Included in that big tent are gay conservatives, many of whom think marriage should remain between a man and a woman. They support civil unions, but they don’t believe in same-sex marriage. Are these gay people anti-gay?

You’re Not a Person If You Disagree With Us

Clearly, some LGBT activists think so. They don’t tolerate gays who reject same-sex marriage, just as they reject anyone in the LGBT community who embraces conservatives. Here’s what one critic of the gay hoteliers who hosted Cruz had to say about them:

Just like what happened with Jenner, if you depart from the radical LGBT agenda, you’re called a sociopath or lunatic. You’re pressured through bullying to conform; otherwise you’re rejected from the “in-group” and isolated until you learn your lesson. Since most people don’t want to be alone and identified with the cursed “out-group,” they give up their principles and beliefs—their freedom—and comply.

This reaction against gay and trans conservatives shows that LGBT activists don’t care a whit about liberty, free speech, or truly being yourself. It’s about power and their militant agenda, and anyone who deviates from it will be attacked, rejected, and publicly humiliated until he or she assimilates. “Resistance is futile.”

Caitlyn Jenner Plays Up Conservatism,"Caitlyn Jenner isn’t backing down from conservative principles even in the face of severe backlash. It was bad enough the reality show star praised Ted Cruz, but now Jenner has really gone off the reservation by attacking Hillary Clinton.

During the season two premiere of the reality show “I Am Cait,” Jenner was on a bus tour in Iowa with a group of transgender women and was asked if they should stop to watch a Democratic debate.

“It’s the last place I want to be,” Jenner said. “But I’m open. We need both sides and if we’re unfortunate enough to get Hillary as our next president, we need her on our side. Although she won’t be – she couldn’t care less about women.” Then, Jenner added: “She cares about herself.”

Of course, the Internet exploded from every corner of the LGBT sphere, calling Jenner stupid, clueless, a “fame-whore,” a privileged trans, and self-centered.

Women Aren’t That Into Hillary

But Jenner’s opinion about Clinton isn’t unusual. Polls show women aren’t supporting her the way they did Barack Obama. That’s not surprising, since a national survey by Gallup found that the top words associated with Clinton are “dishonest,” “liar,” “don’t trust her,” “poor character,” and “dislike her.” In the top five, along with “like her” and “capable of being president,” are “criminal,” “crooked,” “thief,” and “belongs in jail.”

As for women, what has she done for them? Name one piece of legislation she passed as a senator to advance women’s issues? Here’s a hint: zero. When it comes to standing up for women’s rights, she has actually done the opposite. Her family’s foundation, for instance, gave large donations to countries where women are severely oppressed, including Algeria, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and others.

Valerie Hudson and Patricia Leidl have written at Politico saying Clinton’s commitment to women’s rights falls short.

Talking the talk is not the same as walking the walk, and as Clinton prepares for a presidential candidacy in which she will likely tout both her tenure at State and her potentially history-making role as America’s first woman president, it is only natural to examine whether the “Hillary Doctrine” really worked. Last week, amid the furor over her email server, Clinton was marking 20 years since her own groundbreaking 1995 speech in Beijing on women’s rights. But the anniversary also raised an important question: Two decades later, are the world’s women better off for Clinton’s efforts on their behalf—or were those efforts mostly for show?

Here at home, Clinton loses credibility about defending victims of sexual assault. As The Federalist’s Sean Davis details, Clinton turned her back on the many women who accused her husband of sexually assaulting them—despite the fact that she now says all sexual assault victims should be “heard and believed.”

Clinton also has a problem with young female voters. They see her as an entitled rich woman who has been marinating in white privilege all of her life to the point that she doesn’t relate to women who are struggling in today’s world. This is why they are turning to Bernie Sanders in droves.

Let’s Unite, Not Divide

Jenner’s criticism of Clinton is legit. Not only that, Jenner soundly rejects the temptation to play identity politics. Unlike others in the LGBT community, Jenner isn’t making political choices based on identity and single issues. The former Olympian recognizes that what matters most are those issues that help everyone.

The former Olympian recognizes that what matters most are those issues that help everyone.

Jenner made this point clear when one of the other transgender women on the show’s road-trip bus asked which Republican candidates would help transgender people.

“All of them,” Jenner replied. “They don’t hate gays or trans people. They are more ‘I want a thriving economy so every trans person has a job.’”

This is a point lost in the fog of identity politics or to those obsessed with a single issue: the big problems facing our country are the same for all of us: National security, jobs, and a corrupt administrative state that takes the money of everyday citizens and funnels it to Washington and Wall Street.

Many of those who criticize Jenner for supporting conservative candidates are turned off by the star’s wealth and fame, saying not all trans people are privileged, that they can’t afford to have top plastic surgeons and stylists like Jenner has had.

But I have to ask, if that’s their gripe, what do they think the solution is? Wouldn’t they like the economy to improve so they could have more opportunities? Wouldn’t they like to have job security and money to pay for that nose job they want?

It sounds like many in the LGBT community couldn’t care less if our country is overrun by fanatical jihadists, we become enslaved to other nations because of our debt, or we lose our liberty to greedy politicians, so long as they get to use the bathroom they want and say “I do” to whomever they wish.

Identity Politics Make the Big Picture Fade

If we’re not a flourishing country where we have a voice in the government, keep what we earn, are safe, and have opportunities to pursue our dreams, then no one benefits except the aristocratic class ruling from the Capitol—a class of which Hillary Clinton is very much a part. If our country goes bankrupt or is subdued by its enemies, it won’t matter what bathroom you use, whom you marry, or whether you can get your free birth control.

If our country goes bankrupt or is subdued by its enemies, it won’t matter what bathroom you use, whom you marry, or whether you can get your free birth control.

That isn’t to say these issues aren’t important. They are. Obviously, Jenner cares about them very much. But they need to be put in the right perspective when it comes to national elections. This is a significant point and one Cruz has made repeatedly. The powers of the federal government are few and defined, but it has become an invasive, corrupt entity that threatens our prosperity, our security, and our liberty. It needs to be stopped, limited, and brought back into the confines of the Constitution.

These other important issues should be handled at a local and state level where people who don’t have a national stage, like Jenner does, will have a voice about bathrooms, medical care, education, marriage, and any number of issues that affect various groups.

Jenner is right that freedom is what conservatives care about. We don’t hate gay people, but we do hate what corrupt politicians have done to our country. We hate the way Washington takes our money then uses it to line their pockets and those of their buddies on Wall Street.

We hate how our rights are violated by those who are overstepping their powers in the name of compassion and equality. We hate the breakdown of checks and balances in our political system. We hate how our safety is threatened because the federal government refuses to do its job.

This is what conservatives hate—not gays, not blacks, not women, not immigrants. We hate the abuse of power. We hate it because we love liberty, not just for us but for every single person who is a citizen of our great nation—and that includes every individual in the LGBT community.

Keep Your Man Parts Out Of My Bathroom,"The North Carolina General Assembly is making a stand against an invasive ordinance the city of Charlotte passed, which would allow transgender people to use any bathroom they choose. That means if a man says he identifies as a woman, he’s free to use the ladies’ restroom, even if he still does it standing up.

The Charlotte ordinance was supposed to take effect April 1, but the House voted 83-25 to strike it down, preventing all local governments from passing these kinds of anti-privacy laws. It also requires schools, agencies, and public college campuses to only allow people to use bathrooms according to their biological sex.

Following the House vote, the NC Senate passed the bill 32-0, with all Democrats refusing to vote. The bill went to Gov. Pat McCrory to be signed, which he did late Wednesday.

LGBT activists are furious. They’re presenting this as a civil rights issue, even though no one is being denied bathroom use. Even politically conservative Caitlyn Jenner is chiming in, urging people to take action:

Convicted Pedophile Pimps Bathroom Access

Opponents of the bathroom ordinance are praising the state government for protecting women from potential harm. While many transgender people pose no physical threat, the fact is sexual predators cannot be distinguished from other males because all a man has to say is “I identify as a woman” to use the bathroom. There is simply no way to weed out the true transgender person from those who aren’t.

While many transgender people pose no physical threat, the fact is sexual predators cannot be distinguished from other males.

One point that is particularly disturbing about the Charlotte ordinance is that the man who helped found the bathroom bill is a convicted pedophile and registered sex offender. This set off a firestorm throughout the city as residents protested the ordinance’s passage, but the city pushed it through anyway—all in the name of tolerance and compassion.

As it stands now, without the ordinance, if a man is found in a women’s bathroom, he can be asked to leave and removed. If the ordinance were to go into effect, women and girls would no longer have any protection from a man who wants to lurk in the bathroom. The days of sending our daughters into the “ladies’ room” alone would be a thing of the past because it’s no longer assumed to be a safe space.

The NC General Assembly recognized the danger of the Charlotte ordinance and exercised its right as the higher authority to squelch a local law that would create a public safety issue. Some have said this is an overreach by the state government, but when it comes to the safety of North Carolina citizens, it is the state’s responsibility to overturn local ordinances that put citizens at risk.

“When any local government goes so far as to not protect the privacy rights of folks, then the General Assembly will in fact step in,” House Speaker Tim Moore said.

Who Cares About Women, Right?

The NC governor released the following statement after signing the bill:

The basic expectation of privacy in the most personal of settings, a restroom or locker room, for each gender was violated by government overreach and intrusion by the mayor and city council of Charlotte. This radical breach of trust and security under the false argument of equal access not only impacts the citizens of Charlotte but people who come to Charlotte to work, visit or play. This new government regulation defies common sense and basic community norms by allowing, for example, a man to use a woman’s bathroom, shower or locker room.



While local municipalities have important priorities working to oversee police, fire, water and sewer, zoning, roads, and transit, the mayor and city council took action far out of its core responsibilities. As a result, I have signed legislation passed by a bipartisan majority to stop this breach of basic privacy and etiquette which was to go into effect April 1. Although other items included in this bill should have waited until regular session, this bill does not change existing rights under state or federal law.



It is now time for the city of Charlotte elected officials and state elected officials to get back to working on the issues most important to our citizens.

Dean Arp, a Republican representative from Union County, said, “All North Carolina citizens expect bodily privacy in showers, locker rooms and bathrooms.” One of the Democrats who opposed the bill said Charlotte “must not allow fear mongering and discrimination against others.”

“In Mecklenburg County we tried really hard to be inclusive and to accept everyone,” Rep. Trisha Cotham said. “Now we are having this special session that is a waste of taxpayer dollars and it just strips cities and towns of their rights.”

The privacy rights of women and girls don’t seem to concern Cotham or activists in the LGBT community who are calling this bill “pro-discrimination” and “anti-LGBT.” They’re only concerned about what they perceive as “discrimination.” But there’s nothing discriminatory about saying you have to use the bathroom that correlates with your biological sex. No transgender person is being denied access to a toilet.

Feelings Don’t Always Tell the Truth

Yet this is what the militant LGBT community does in the name of tolerance. It runs roughshod over the rights and safety of others to advance their delusions. It doesn’t matter that letting men into a girls’ bathroom simply because he feels like a woman puts women at risk. They just don’t care. They only care about their perceived rights, not real rights. They only care about their feelings.

They are willing to allow a girl to possibly be raped or molested just so a handful of men can pee in the ladies’ restroom.

This is what we hear from those pushing this dangerous ordinance. “But what about the feelings of transgender people?” Feelings aren’t the basis of law, and feelings don’t determine what is real and what is true. While it is certainly tragic that some people struggle with gender identity, what they need is help working through those psychological issues, not laws to perpetuate their delusions, especially when those laws violate the rights and safety of others.

The LGBT community and the ACLU are demanding that the NC bill, which protects women, be condemned. What needs to be condemned are people who care nothing about the stability and safety of their fellow citizens. They care only about their own feelings and their own militant agenda—to hell with everyone else. Even as they whine about intolerance, they are proving to be the most intolerant of all.

Just think about it. They are willing to allow a girl to possibly be raped or molested just so a handful of men can pee in the ladies’ restroom. That’s not a civil right. That’s sick.

Does Generation Z Really Defy Gender Norms?,"A study by the Innovation Group has media outlets buzzing about how Generation Z—those born between 1995 and 2012—utterly defies the gender binary. Only 48 percent of the marketing research group’s respondents said they identified as 100 percent heterosexual, compared with 65 percent of millennials.

A previous study by FTI Consulting found that voting-age members of Generation Z are incredibly far-left when it comes to “equal rights,” with 75 percent favoring gay marriage and 83 percent favoring “equal rights” for transgender people, with this new survey finding that 70 percent of Generation Z believe it’s “important for public spaces to provide access to gender neutral bathrooms.”

Reason’s Hit and Run blog interpreted the data as meaning Generation Z is “queer as f**k.” But are they really?

The Results Contradict Relevant Data

CrossMap.com compiled the criticisms of several experts (comments originally gathered by LifeSiteNews) who called the newest survey’s conclusions into question.

As any student of introductory statistics should immediately realize, the sample size for the Innovation Group’s study was tiny. We’re talking 300 respondents from Gen Z, and a roughly equal number of millennials. Total Gen Z respondents listed under the results for sexual orientation was just 203.

The sample size may be one reason the data is at odds with relevant data previously gathered. One professor, Paul Sullins, cited the National Survey of Family Growth (2011), which reported that between ‘06 and ‘08, 96% of men and 94% of women “identified as exclusively heterosexual,” compared to 2002 data, which pegged the percentage of heterosexuals at about 90%. That number has remained steady for around 60 years, if you use the Kinsey Institute’s 1948 study claiming the same percentage as a benchmark.

As Sullins noted, “The idea that [these numbers] are rapidly changing, based on a small marketing survey, is not convincing.”

The National Survey for Family Growth also reported the percent of men aged 18 to 24 who “reported only opposite sex attraction” at 88.6 percent, and three-quarters for women the same age.

Designed for Perception, not Reality

After reading the Innovation Group’s survey questions, I quickly realized many were, in a word, “puffers.” Meaning, they read like they were intended to puff up the perception that Gen Z is a radically different demographic, without gathering hard behavioral data to support that theory. (Reading the gender-bending bios of those who presented the Innovation Group data in a South by Southwest panel earlier this month reinforced this suspicion.)

Word gets around quick in school when a peer decides she doesn’t want to be identified as ‘she.’

A prime example is this question: “How much do you agree or disagree with the statement ‘People are exploring their sexuality more than in the past?’” Or “How much do you agree or disagree with the statement, ‘Gender doesn’t define a person as much as it used to.’”

As one of the critics, Dr. Philip Harold, pointed out to LifeSiteNews, how much do Gen Zers really know about what sort of sexual exploration was going on “in the past?” Or how much gender “used to” define a person?

“For someone who could remember the 1960s and 1970s, unisex clothes were all the rage. No pink toddler clothing was allowed during a period in the 1970s in the Sears Roebuck catalog, but nobody young knows that,” said Morris.

Another survey question asked respondents whether they had heard (not used, or identified with) certain terms, such as “asexual,” “demisexual,” or “genderqueer,” and another asked whether respondents knew someone who used, “They, them, or ‘ze’” in lieu of gendered pronouns “he,” “she,” “him,” and “her.”

How do answers to these questions shed any light on whether Generation Z is really rejecting the traditional sexual binary? Answer: nothing. Nothing at all. In fact, one would expect a high percent of respondents to answer “yes,” to the latter question based on the novelty of the behavior, not its commonality. Word gets around quick in school when a peer decides she doesn’t want to be identified as “she.”

Androgenization, or Status Quo Feminine and Masculine?

But lack of academic rigor in the survey design doesn’t end with tiny sample size and puffer questions. One of the Innovation Group’s most puzzling survey questions was whether respondents “always buy products that are geared specifically toward my gender, rather than non-gendered products, when it comes to: shoes, clothes, deodorant, fragrance, sports equipment, accessories.” (Emphasis mine.)

Only 44 percent responded that they always bought clothes geared toward their gender, the highest percentage out of any listed category.

Only 44 percent responded that they always bought clothes geared toward their gender, the highest percentage out of any listed category.

Such data and the supposed embrace of the whole gender identity spectrum by Generation Z has led some experts to predict non-gendered clothing lines to be the biggest trend since patterned leggings. Is this a sign we should panic, because Gen Z girls aren’t dressing and smelling like girls, and Gen Z boys aren’t dressing and smelling like boys?

Not if you really think about the question instead of simply reacting to it. What do they mean by “non-gendered” products? What shoes, clothes, or fragrances do you see in the big box store that aren’t gendered?

Some of Tom’s deodorants could easily be classified as non-gendered (“Original Care,” “Long-Lasting”). Non-gendered fragrances have been on trend for at least a decade (note this New York Times article from 2006, and this Cosmopolitan piece from last summer, both attributing the popularity of non-gendered fragrances to taste, not statements on sexuality). $5 pairs of flip-flops are easy to snag at the superstore or Old Navy, and ball caps look good on everyone who looks good in hats. You can easily swing certain styles of sunglasses either way.

My Generation Z sister suggested some t-shirts, sweatshirts, and jackets might fall in the non-gendered category, drawing many teen girls especially, since oversized clothes are in vogue (heck, even I wear my husband’s old, non-gendered high school sweatshirt sometimes.)

But none of these purchases have androgenized the teenage masses. Take a look around any school campus, and the gender norms for apparel are strikingly consistent: teen girls wear long tops and leggings and maybe a long, flowy sweater, usually accompanied by stylish boots or dainty flats, and boys wear t-shirts and jeans.

As another millennial pointed out, it wasn’t too long ago that millennial high school boys were wearing pants designed for girls before clothing designers came out with skinny jeans for men. Yet millennials polled as subscribing to the gender binary more so than the Gen Z respondents. Rest assured: bland and boxy androgynous clothing won’t be flying off the racks at your local Penny’s any time soon.

Young People Don’t Know What They Want Yet

Let us also not forget to put the results of this survey in the context of youth—a time when idealism, curiosity, openness to change, and raging hormones muddle together with inexperience and underdeveloped reasoning skills.

The LGBTQ++ assembly has always employed pressure tactics and indoctrination to achieve their goals.

The Innovation Group’s conclusions are way out of left field when compared to relevant data gathered on a larger scale with more rigorous methodology. So could this supposed generation of gender unbelievers be a pressure narrative exerted on the older generations who are less accepting of the growing diversification of gender identities encapsulated by the (LGBTQ++) alphabet soup?

The LGBTQ++ assembly has always employed pressure tactics and indoctrination to achieve their goals. The beliefs of Gen Zers fresh out of high school, or still in it, would certainly reflect this. Presenting their views in a survey layered with perception-puffing soft data could be a shot across the bow at older generations: get in line, because the genderless future is here.

So take the hype with a healthy pinch of salt. Whether it’s pressure from the Left, poor methodology, or both, the survey doesn’t represent the end of humanity. Until more and better quality data come out in support of this tiny marketing survey’s conclusions, we have good reason to believe that Generation Z, despite their political acceptance of a wide range of gender identities and behavior, will continue to populate the earth the old-fashioned way and reinforce the natural gender binary in the process.

"NC Fights Federal, Biz Blackmail Over Trans Bathroom Law","North Carolina’s Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act, which requires people to use the bathroom that matches their biological sex and not their preferred “gender identity,” has been maligned across the nation as “anti-LGBT,” but the law isn’t discriminatory at all.

The state legislature passed and the governor signed the Privacy and Security Act after the Charlotte City Council voted to require businesses to allow a man into a women’s restroom, shower, or locker room if the men want. According to governor’s office, “this ordinance would have eliminated the basic expectations of privacy people have when using the rest room by allowing people to use the restroom of their choice.”

The Charlotte ordinance, which had been soundly defeated in the past but was pushed through this year despite opposition from parents, businesses, and pro-women groups, brought up serious questions about privacy, as well as safety concerns that perverts posing as transgender people could take advantage of the law to harm others.

North Carolina’s action is not isolated. It is one of at least 37 states where cities and towns cannot pass regulations that exceed the authority given to them by the state. In passing the bathroom ordinance, Charlotte was exceeding its authority and setting rules that had ramifications beyond the city. According to the state, “the legislature acted to address privacy and safety concerns if this ordinance was allowed to go into effect on April 1.”

The backlash has been heated as the legislature has been accused of passing a bill that violates the rights of LGBT citizens. In response, Gov. Pat McCrory published a list of “Myths vs Facts” about this common-sense privacy law. He makes 18 very important points, including that the bill does not “limit or prohibit private sector companies from adopting their own nondiscrimination policies or practices,” “take away existing protections for individuals in North Carolina,” prevent businesses from allowing “transgender individuals to use the bathroom, locker room or other facilities of the gender they identify with, or provide other accommodations,” or “prohibit towns, cities or counties in North Carolina from setting their own nondiscrimination policies in employment.” In addition, “This law simply says people must use the bathroom of the sex listed on their birth certificate. Anyone who has undergone a sex change can change their sex on their birth certificate.”

Obama, Corporations Threaten Blackmail

President Obama is currently considering whether he thinks the new law is a reason to axe North Carolina’s federal aid for schools, highways, and housing. Title IX funding is being threatened, even though a court has already ruled in Virginia that schools should not lose Title IX funding for not allowing transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice. According to this ruling, McCrory is right that NC won’t lose the funding. This decision, however, is being appealed.

No one is being denied use of a bathroom, and private businesses are free to do what they want.

Obama’s threat in the name of “civil rights” puts pressure on North Carolina to repeal the law. Experts say this is unlikely, but Obama’s review of the pro-privacy act puts North Carolina on notice, as has happened in other states. Such a threat would make sense if the law were actually discriminatory, but it isn’t since men and women are being treated equally—both have equal access to bathrooms according to their actual sex. No one is being denied use of a bathroom, and private businesses are free to do what they want.

Despite this fact, big companies, such as American Airlines, Lowe’s, Google, Apple, and the NBA have denounced the law. ESPN, which has been considering Charlotte Motor Speedway for its summer X Games, has said it embraces diversity and inclusion and will “evaluate all its options.”

Facebook, which has a data center in North Carolina, says it’s “disappointed by the recent events in North Carolina.” The NCAA, which has men’s basketball tournaments planned in North Carolina through 2018, has stated that it is “monitoring the situation.”

Do What We Want Or Else

Obviously, there is a full-court press of intimidation being leveled at North Carolina for standing up for a common-sense privacy law. This hysteria over HB2 shows the power LGBT militants and their sycophants in Hollywood and big business exert over the minds of Americans, which results in nothing less than propagandized groupthink rooted in mass delusion.

Threatening a state that wants to protect those rights is a form of bullying that borders on fascism.

Forcing businesses to allow men into women’s bathrooms (and vice versa) and violating real privacy rights and then threatening a state that wants to protect those rights is a form of bullying that borders on fascism—a point Tammy Bruce made when LGBT activists made threats against owners of a pizza shop in Indianapolis.

“For us to put on to these small business owners this kind of totalitarian boot is clearly us becoming the monster we were fighting against,” she said. “This kind of bullying, this kind of fascism in the name of equality doesn’t make sense.”

Libertarian journalist John Stossel agrees, saying in an interview with Bill O’Reilly that the homosexual “movement has moved from tolerance to totalitarianism. It’s the totalitarianism of the Left.”

The Ultimate End: Expanding Government Power

When the governor of New York said he was going to ban travel of public employees to North Carolina because of the pro-privacy law, McCrory called him out for his ludicrous declaration.

If you stand with North Carolina, you stand for states’ rights, individual liberties, actual civil rights, and common sense.

“Is the type of democracy we’re going to have where you go to Cuba and then you tell citizens not to come to North Carolina?” McCrory asked. “First of all, a lot of New Yorkers already moved to North Carolina, have made North Carolina their permanent home. I’m sorry, Gov. Cuomo, but that’s a fact. Maybe it’s because we believe in just common-sense privacy laws, and by the way we also are against any types of discrimination, but that doesn’t mean we overturn basic common-sense expectations of privacy that men and women and children expect when they go to a locker room or a restroom or a shower facility. This is ridiculous.”

It is ridiculous. The Charlotte ordinance that started all this would have forced businesses and schools to open bathrooms to anyone according to their self-perceived gender identity, violating the safety and privacy of women and children. The state of North Carolina rightly stepped in, because this is a valid pubic safety issue, and restored the rights of North Carolinians as well as protecting women and children, something the gay mafia dismisses in the name of its militant agenda.

Now, the Obama administration is trying to exert authoritarian control over a sovereign state in the name of civil rights when no civil rights are being violated. This is really what’s at the heart of transgender laws—not equal protections of transgender people, but the growth and power of the state.

Anyone who supports this kind of totalitarian overreach or cheers the boycott of North Carolina has drunk the Kool-Aid of leftist bullies. If you stand with North Carolina, you stand for states’ rights, individual liberties, actual civil rights, and common sense. The NC governor needs to be supported, not attacked, and encouraged not to cave to the dictates of the gay mafia as other governors have done.

“The bottom line is that it will take real courage to stop the machine of government abuse of power, a machine the gay mafia has such a hand in promoting,” writes Senior Contributor to The Federalist Stella Morabito. “GOP governors who refuse to respect the will of the majority of the people of their states by caving to LGBT tactics of extortion may think they are protecting their state’s economy and reputation. They may even feel gratification when the mafia pats them on the back for cooperating, and congratulates them for ‘nothing happening’ to the nice state they got there. But that will prove to be nothing but a temporary illusion for those governors and their states. And as such things always go, the children will suffer the most.”

The Left’s Huge Double Standard For Corporate Speech,"Recent state legislative battles in Georgia, Mississippi, and North Carolina have once again catapulted religious freedom to forefront of the national political conversation, drawing the ire of many mainstream media outlets and LGBT interest groups.

In Georgia, Gov. Nathan Deal vetoed House Bill 757, which provided protections for religious officials unwilling to participate in same-sex marriage ceremonies and grew to include language opponents argued might even permit businesses to deny employment to anyone with differing religious beliefs. Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina approved his state’s bill, which removes sexual orientation from the statewide anti-discrimination ordinance, thus making it easier for faith-based organizations to decline goods and services such as open access to bathrooms and locker rooms. Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant signed similar conscientious objector legislation on April 5.

Legislative contests like these have become all too familiar in today’s political world. They represent only the latest scuffles in the national battle over state-level religious freedom being waged across the country, a struggle that began when states started legalizing same-sex marriage and accelerated after the Supreme Court mandated gay marriage nationwide in Obergefell v. Hodges last June.

Indeed, we’ve seen almost the exact same controversies play out in places like Arizona, Indiana, Arkansas, and Texas, wherein state representatives pass religious liberty legislation with substantial majorities, only to have their Republican executives either veto it outright or water it down due to extraordinary pressure by outside groups that relentlessly cry “anti-gay!” and “state-sanctioned discrimination!”

The major difference in the most recent battles over marriage, however, is the massive, even unprecedented amount of corporate pressure states now face in the days both leading up to—and after—their decisions.

The Rise of Corporate Activism

A slew of major American corporations, celebrities, and politicians threatened to boycott and pull business from Indiana, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and others in response to their religious freedom bills. The most notable culprits include corporate giants like Apple, Google, Facebook, Home Depot, Netflix, Dell, PayPal, and Coca-Cola; Hollywood A-listers like Anne Hathaway, Julianne Moore, and Seth McFarlane; production companies like Disney, Marvel, and AMC Networks (which films smash hit “The Walking Dead” in Georgia); city mayors and state governors, like Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York and Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington; and even sports organizations like the NFL, NBA, and NCAA, all of which threatened to take the states out of consideration for hosting major athletic events in the coming years.

While it’s difficult to estimate the combined economic impact of all these boycotts, suffice it to say all that lost business would be devastating.

Georgia and North Carolina have tax policies that rank among the most-friendly for businesses nationwide, and while it’s difficult to estimate the combined economic impact of all these boycotts, suffice it to say all that lost business would be devastating. To put it in perspective, from 2014-2015 Georgia reportedly raked in $6 billion in revenue from the film industry alone. A boycott from just that one industry likely would have forced the governor’s veto, and when you figure in the combined revenue generated from the other corporations listed above, it’s plain the bill never stood a chance.

This type of open activism by corporate heavyweights is similar to what Michael Needham and Ryan T. Anderson call “cultural cronyism,” a phenomenon in which big government and its allies in the courts align with special interests to enforce certain policy goals. These policies often would fail in the public forums of our republic because, as Needham and Anderson put it, they typically involve unpopular interests that contradict the public good and the will of voters.

In the past few years we’ve witnessed this at the federal level, as the Obama administration has threatened to withhold millions in federal funds to coerce public schools into radically altering their sex curriculum and bathroom policies.

These corporations and celebrities are doing essentially the same thing: leveraging their immense material worth against these states to influence public policy decisions that should be left to the democratic process.

For Some Reason, Corporations Feel Free to Attack

As The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway notes, “it’s pretty obvious there’s a highly-orchestrated, corporate campaign that’s been going on at a national level” against legislation providing religious exemptions in same-sex weddings. While occasionally there’s some pushback on other topics like immigration, for instance, the nation’s most powerful corporate elites typically only get this aggressive when states try to push back against the LGBT agenda. This makes sense, after all, for there’s documented evidence of LGBT lobbying groups dishing out cash to cozy up to American business leaders.

It doesn’t really make sense to alienate half of your potential market, does it?

You might argue that these industry tycoons only get involved because it’s good business; support for same-sex marriage has skyrocketed in recent years, and they want to appeal to their consumers. Although that may be plausible, last year’s Pew Research poll indicates that roughly half the public believes religious officials and small business owners should have the option to refuse to participate in gay weddings. It doesn’t really make sense to alienate half of your potential market, does it?

You might also believe these businessmen are simply acting on their values. They genuinely want to stand up against perceived discrimination against LGBT individuals. If that were the case, then why haven’t businesses like Apple, Disney, and Coca-Cola pulled their operations in countries like Saudi Arabia and India, which criminalize homosexuality? Why haven’t state governors and city mayors issued travel bans to all the countries that haven’t recognized same-sex marriage?

Big Business Is Bad—Unless it Shares My Agenda

The political response to the corporate activism in Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and others has highlighted the double standard regarding corporations’ rights to free speech.

The partisan divide over the issue has been stark ever since the Supreme Court’s 2010 ruling in Citizens United v. FEC, which allows businesses, unions, and individuals to donate unlimited amounts to political action committees, or “super PACs.” While Republicans have generally supported the ruling, the 2016 Democratic presidential candidates have both designated finance reform as a major priority in their campaigns.

One would expect those crusading against big money influencing politics to harshly criticize exactly that happening in Georgia and North Carolina.

Sen. Bernie Sanders characterizes the idea that corporations have speech rights through financial donations as “ absurd ,” and his disdain for Citizens United has even compelled him to publicly refuse any support from super PACs that spring up in his name. This stance is so persuasive amongst his supporters that he actually risks losing support if he doesn’t frequently denounce big money. It’s more personal for Clinton, who reminded us during a February debate that the ruling came about because of “a right-wing attack” on her and her campaign. She followed up by reassuring voters that “you’re not going to find anybody more committed to aggressive campaign finance reform than me.”

So one would reasonably expect those crusading against big money influencing politics to harshly criticize the week-long, very public display of exactly that happening in Georgia and North Carolina. Yet any condemnation of the billionaires threatening these Republican governors was conspicuously absent in the days surrounding their respective decisions.

Indeed, the left-leaning mainstream media instead applauded the activism, commending big business for “leading the charge” on gay rights. Both Sanders and Clinton focused their responses to the bills on simply reiterating their unequivocal support for LGBT individuals, notably keeping silent about the corporate muscle that forced Deal’s veto and—with the help of the Obama administration—may soon compel McCrory to backpedal in North Carolina.

The few who did call out these corporations for their bullying tactics included some Republican groups who supported the bills, but even on the Right the majority of the criticism was instead directed at Deal for wavering in the face of all that pressure. This is likely because most conservatives agree with Citizens United and believe corporations have a right to use their resources for political speech. At least they’re being ideologically consistent, which is apparently more than can be said for the Left.

Call the Big Man’s Bluff

Clearly this type of corporate activism amounts to essentially the same thing as the campaign finance law Citizens United establishes: politicians beholden to powerful special interests. In the same way that an elected official elevates the policy interests of people who contribute lots of money to his campaign, a governor sacrifices some of his (or his constituents’) policy goals to appease select billionaire business owners who happen to generate the bulk of his state’s revenue.

This surely isn’t the last time we’ll see this network of like-minded corporations insert themselves into state and local policy battles.

Although things may soon resolve themselves in the South, this surely isn’t the last time we’ll see this network of like-minded corporations insert themselves into state and local policy battles.

Indeed, transgender rights and “gender identity” discrimination in public facilities, two issue areas included in the new North Carolina and Mississippi laws, are shaping up to be the new target for corporations and politicians to hijack for their political theater act going forward. We saw the saga play out last month with South Dakota‘s bathroom bill, which sought to protect women and children by prohibiting individuals to use public facilities based on their subjective “gender identity” alone. With bills on this issue coming down the pipeline in at least ten other states, it’s likely we’ll see corporations making headlines again soon enough.

If our media and our politicians refuse to call out the double standard that enables corporations to promote unpopular special interests, what can be done about it?

State groups and representatives should start exerting equal pressure onto their governors to call these corporations on their bluffs. While states certainly run the risk of losing millions or even billions in revenue, some of these businesses also have a lot to lose. By following through on their threats, these industries would sacrifice the consumer market each state provides, lose out on the opportunity to conduct business in some tax-friendly areas, and potentially eliminate hundreds of jobs, leading to an angry mob of workers they’d have to appease.

As many of these hypocritical corporations have already proven, they’ll kick their artificial values to the curb once they realize there’s a lot of money on the line. Governors, it’s now on you to expose them for it.

Trans Mafia Put North Carolina In A Chokehold,"The ongoing LGBT activism that has overtaken a large part of the United States puts us at a strange crossroads in our country’s history: for perhaps the first time in American history, a civil rights effort is in fact more authoritarian and intolerant than the structure of power against which it is rebelling.

Aided by media that are both incompetent and often transparently biased, along with a burgeoning corporate culture that has discovered the economic benefits of public moral preening, we have what Stella Morabito aptly terms the “LGBT mafia:” a profoundly illiberal social movement rather single-mindedly determined to stamp out even minor and inconsequential dissent from its orthodoxy. It’s not going anywhere. In fact, it’s getting worse.

Many of us were appropriately horrified a couple of years ago when Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich was ousted from his position for, years before, having opposed gay marriage legalization in California. Two years later, the controversy surrounding Eich’s downfall now seems rather quaint in comparison—some histrionics, to be sure, and a silly display of activist vanity from OKCupid, but that was mostly it. The dismaying episode was nonetheless quickly over, and perhaps many of us thought we’d seen the worst of it.

The Hounds Smell Weakness

How wrong could we possibly get? Last month North Carolina’s “bathroom bill,” which mandates that men must use men’s restrooms and women must use women’s, unleashed the full fury of the LGBT mafia. It makes Eich’s ousting look like a tête-à-tête in a Parisian Enlightenment salon by comparison.

You could even sort of understand why he did it, at least when you adjust for spineless cowardice.

In response to this incredibly reasonable and commonsense bill, Bruce Springsteen cancelled a concert in Greensboro; dozens of corporations signed a protest letter; PayPal withdrew plans for an operations center in Charlotte; the composer Stephen Schwartz vowed that his productions—among them the Broadway hit “Wicked”—will not run in North Carolina; A&E and Lionsgate declared they will not film any productions in the state; and the federal government is deciding whether it can withhold billions and billions of dollars in highway, housing, and education funds.

All this because North Carolina affirmed what everyone believed until the day before yesterday: that we shouldn’t allow grown men into women’s restrooms.

We must give the LGBT mafia credit: their tactics work, and they know it. State governments and state governors are exquisitely sensitive to negative press, and many of them have folded in the face of this irrepressible onslaught. A year ago Indiana Gov. Mike Pence amended a state-level religious freedom law because of withering criticism from LGBT activists. The law in question didn’t actually do any of the things the critics said it did, but that didn’t matter: Indiana was an example, and Pence had to be broken to the saddle placed on his back.

In Georgia last month, Gov. Nathan Deal vetoed a religious liberty bill that would have protected religious objectors from having to violate their beliefs, including from being forced to accommodate same-sex marriages. This was religious liberty 101 stuff, noncontroversial to anyone who takes the First Amendment even moderately seriously. Just the same, corporations began threatening boycotts and relocations if the bill passed. Deal acted accordingly and scuttled the bill. You could even sort of understand why he did it, at least when you adjust for spineless cowardice.

The latest scofflaw in North Carolina may also have made an impression to its neighbor to the south: Gov. Nikki Haley has dismissed a similar law proposed for South Carolina, saying, “I don’t believe it’s necessary.” (Just you wait, governor.)

No Tolerance for the Tolerant

This is not merely a state-level affair. In Wisconsin, a young woman who “identifies” as a man successfully agitated to run as prom king at her local high school. The school would not allow her to do so, so she and other students protested until “the decision was taken from the school level to the district level,” and the Kenosha Unified School District mandated that the school accommodate the young woman’s desires. A higher authority stripped what little autonomy the high school had in this important and sensitive area.

This is the LGBT mafia. This is what it does. It is what we have to live with now.

It should break your heart that this young woman is laboring under the delusion that she is a man. I know it breaks mine. Yet I am also angry at the school district that indulged her misunderstanding and imposed this misbegotten belief on a high school that had correctly assessed the situation.

We are living in an age of growing intolerance and prejudice: not from the scary white male conservative boogeymen who normally fill that role in the public’s perception, but from the ministers of liberal dogma themselves. Are you a clergy member who wants to uphold the ancient conjugal man-woman view of marriage? Tough luck. Do you want to protect your daughter from the predatory men who might take advantage of a well-meaning transgender bathroom access law? Sorry, you’re a bigot. Do you want to run your business in accordance with your sincere and reasonable beliefs? You’ll be run out of town.

This is the LGBT mafia. This is what it does. It is what we have to live with now. If your legislature or governor wants to pass some modest piece of legislation that protects your right to live as you please, then they’ll make your state an offer it can’t refuse.

Selective Boycotts Over Trans Laws Show Left's Hypocrisy,"In light of Mississippi’s decision to pass a religious freedom bill, Bryan Adams cancelled an upcoming show at the Mississippi Coast Coliseum. The performer follows in the footsteps of Bruce Springsteen and PayPal, which pulled out of North Carolina over the state’s recently passed bathroom ordinance.

Adams, known for hits such as “(Everything I Do) I Do It For You” from heteronormative classic “Robin Hood,” performed in Arkansas in September 2015. Arkansas passed its own religious freedom bill in April 2015. Granted, Arkansas’ bill has not played out as opponents predicted and restaurants continue to serve people regardless of sexual orientation, because that’s not what religious freedom bills are about. A Muslim prisoner in the state also benefited from a religious freedom bill, albeit the federal version signed by President Bill Clinton. Maybe Adams is taking a nuanced stand.

Actually, no, he isn’t. It seems Adams isn’t so troubled enough about bigotry to skip countries where women and members of the LGBT community are jailed and abused.

Springsteen, to his credit, does not have a history of cashing checks from shows in such countries and did play the role of actual dissident in East Berlin in 1988. Alas, Springsteen’s musical decline has been “obvious for decades,” which stretches back to the late ‘80s, so perhaps “Howard Zinn with a guitar” can be given a tad more leeway for finding a way to remind people other than nostalgic Baby Boomers that he does, in fact, continue to exist.

PayPal, on the other hand, doesn’t need such reminders. It also does not have quite as clean a record on where the company chooses to do business. As noted by North Carolina Rep. Robert Pittenger, “PayPal does business in 25 countries where homosexual behavior is illegal, including 5 countries where the penalty is death, yet they object to the North Carolina legislature overturning a misguided ordinance about letting men in to the women’s bathroom? Perhaps PayPal would like to try and clarify this seemingly very hypocritical position.”

Nah, clarification is unnecessary. It’s all virtue signaling and Selma envy. That is, these aging rockers and various corporations may pine for free love and the summer of ’69, but they only really care insofar as people know they’re good without requiring them to actually put their money where their mouths are. Otherwise, they would boycott large swathes of the world rather than focusing on a couple of states where women and LGBT-identifying folks are free to live their lives without the state coming after them.

But that would require more than posturing and waiting for the tempest in a teacup to pass. It would require actual financial loss and commitment rather than hypocritical preening over the latest new political battle. Of course, maybe they actually mean it this time. As we can learn from Adams and Arkansas, let’s check back in about five months and see just how courageous those convictions are. I’m sure this time they totally mean it.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/04/11/selective-boycotts-over-bathroom-laws-show-the-hypocrisy-of-progressive-activists/,2016-04-11
Trans Activists Not Satisfied With NC Job Protections,"North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory has signed an executive order that changes part of the state’s controversial bathroom bill, which sets discrimination policy for the state and requires people to use public bathrooms that match their biological sex, not their gender perception.

The order is a response to backlash from LGBT activists and some businesses, who have been up in arms about the state’s Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act (HB2), which they say is “anti-trans.” The governor’s action seeks to ease concerns about employment discrimination without changing the part of the law that protects women’s privacy and security.

First, Read the Actual Rules

The executive order expands the state’s employment policy to special protections for gays and transgender people, but stops short of changing the part of the law that requires people to use public bathrooms according to their biological sex and not their gender perception. The change to the employment section reads:

The State of North Carolina is committed to administering and implementing all State human resources policies, practices and programs fairly and equitably, without unlawful discrimination, harassment or retaliation on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity age, political affiliation, genetic information, or disability.

The order also says “private businesses, nonprofit employers and local governments may establish their own non-discrimination employment policies.”

Regarding protection of rights in employment, HB2 originally stated, “It is the public policy of this State to protect and safeguard the right and opportunity of all persons to seek, obtain and hold employment without discrimination or abridgement on account of race, religion, color, national origin, age, biological sex or handicap by employers which regularly employ 15 or more employees.”

As for bathroom accommodations, McCrory’s executive order keeps in place the original provisions:

In North Carolina, private businesses can set their own rules for their own restroom, locker room, and shower facilities, free from government interference.

< Under current law, every multiple occupancy restroom, locker room or shower facilities located in a cabinet agency must be designated for and only used by persons based on their biological sex. Agencies may make reasonable accommodations upon a person’s request due to special circumstances.

The order says all state agencies, cities, counties, universities, and colleges are “encouraged to make a similar accommodation when practicable.”

‘Defies Common Sense and Basic Community Norms’

The Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act was drafted in response to an overreach by a Charlotte ordinance that required businesses to allow people to use the bathroom that matched not their biological sex but their gender perception. This would have allowed men who say they identify as women to use the women’s bathrooms and locker rooms at clubs and schools. The state legislature and governor stepped in to protect women and girls from the potential threat that could result from such an ordinance.

This would have allowed men who say they identify as women to use women’s bathrooms and locker rooms.

When HB2 passed, McCrory said, “The basic expectation of privacy in the most personal of settings, a restroom or locker room, for each gender was violated by government overreach and intrusion by the mayor and city council of Charlotte. This radical breach of trust and security under the false argument of equal access not only impacts the citizens of Charlotte but people who come to Charlotte to work, visit or play. This new government regulation defies common sense and basic community norms by allowing, for example, a man to use a woman’s bathroom, shower or locker room.”

In a video announcement published Tuesday, McCrory said the Charlotte ordinance was an intrusive mandate that violated privacy. It was a “solution in search of a problem,” he said. McCrory reaffirmed that his executive order “maintains common sense gender-specific restroom and locker facilities in government buildings and in our schools,” but private businesses could continue to set their own rules for bathrooms and locker rooms.

Trans Activists Refuse to Compromise

The American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina called McCrory’s actions “a poor effort to save face after his sweeping attacks on the LGBT community, and they fall far short of correcting the damage done when he signed into law the harmful House Bill 2, which stigmatizes and mandates discrimination against gay and transgender people.”

This ‘will only strengthen our resolve to fight back against this discriminatory and misguided legislative action.’

“Efforts to divide the LGBT community by extending limited protections but leaving in place the rules mandating discrimination against the transgender community will only strengthen our resolve to fight back against this discriminatory and misguided legislative action,” said Sarah Preston, acting executive director of the ACLU of North Carolina. “We call on Gov. McCrory and the North Carolina legislature to repeal House Bill 2 and replace it with full non-discrimination protections for all LGBT people.”

Roy Cooper, the North Carolina attorney general, who said he would not defend the law and who is McCrory’s gubernatorial opponent this fall, says McCrory’s order doesn’t go far enough: “Governor McCrory’s executive order is a day late and a veto short,” Cooper said. “The sweeping discrimination law he signed has already cost North Carolina hundreds of jobs and millions of dollars in revenue. I’m glad Governor McCrory has finally acknowledged the great damage his legislation has done, but he needs to do much more.”

The Charlotte Chamber of Commerce praised McCrory’s order, saying it was in favor of anything that promoted the city and state “as places that promote diversity, inclusiveness and equality.”

“We applaud the governor’s actions today which demonstrate that North Carolina is an open and welcoming state,” the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce said in a statement. “We strongly encourage the leadership and members of the General Assembly to take quick action to the governor’s call to ensure citizens have the right to pursue claims of discrimination at the state level.”

"What Makes A Woman? LGBT Ed Says Long Hair, Accessories","Transgender activists have traditionally said that gender is defined not by biological or physical traits but by how a person identifies. But on Monday, the LGBT editor of Think Progress offered several new criteria, including hair length, arm hair, and whether a person is wearing a man’s or woman’s watch.

In a Twitter exchange with me, Zack Ford said some astonishing things that absolutely undermine the key claims of transgender activists. Last week, I wrote an article arguing that if states or cities are going to compel businesses to allow transgendered people into gender-specific bathrooms and locker rooms, a definition of transgender is needed. If business owners are going to be punished for refusing bathroom or locker room access to a trans person, they have to know who is and who is not actually trans.

When a woman sees a suspicious “man in a dress” in her locker room, she needs to know when making a complaint is legitimate and when it is bigotry. Thus far, no reasonable definition has emerged. Since he’s the LGBT editor for Think Progress, one would assume Ford is somewhat expert in the area. Monday morning, however, he tweeted at me to ask what the significance of the image at the top of my piece was.

Hey @BlueBoxDave, I'm curious: what is the photo in this piece supposed to represent? https://t.co/g0ZAouoofj



— Zack Ford (@ZackFord) April 18, 2016

@ZackFord I don't know. I didn't choose it.



— David Marcus (@BlueBoxDave) April 18, 2016

.@BlueBoxDave I figured not, which is why I asked. Do you think it's appropriate and fits what you wrote? What's your impression of it?



— Zack Ford (@ZackFord) April 18, 2016

@ZackFord I think it's fine. Not an easy piece to find an image for.



— David Marcus (@BlueBoxDave) April 18, 2016

.@BlueBoxDave Who do you think it represents? Which bathroom do you think that individual should use?



— Zack Ford (@ZackFord) April 18, 2016

@ZackFord I have no idea, I also have no idea if they can apply to Mt Holyoke. That's the point.



— David Marcus (@BlueBoxDave) April 18, 2016



The Mount Holyoke comment is a reference to a section of my piece dealing with women’s colleges. As it turns out, most women’s colleges admit trans women. But these colleges have very different ways of determining who is a woman for purposes of applying to or attending their institutions. This is further evidence that no reasonable definition of “transgender” exists.

This is when things started to get a little strange.

.@BlueBoxDave I see a non-trans man wearing makeup and bursting through a wall. Seems to communicate the law enables predation.



— Zack Ford (@ZackFord) April 18, 2016

@ZackFord How do you know he's non trans?



— David Marcus (@BlueBoxDave) April 18, 2016



I was actually kind of stunned that Ford would make such a proclamation about this person’s gender. It literally runs counter to almost everything I have read of his on this issue. The idea that he could tell this person’s real gender by looking at one photo is entirely inconsistent with his, and trans advocates’ previous statements on the issue. But then Ford doubled down!

.@BlueBoxDave He has facial hair, a short haircut, arm hair, and he's wearing a man's watch. That's not a transgender woman.



— Zack Ford (@ZackFord) April 18, 2016



WHAT? Setting aside the bizarre idea that “wearing a man’s watch” defines a person’s gender, the focus on hair is also very weird. Of course there are trans women with facial hair, especially among those who do not choose hormone treatments. Ford, whether he knows it or not, is misgendering thousands of people who have to shave in order to present as a woman, not to mention trans women who choose to wear facial hair.

Or, as one Twitter user put it:

@seanmdav @BlueBoxDave @ZackFord He's a woman right after shaving, but by the time 5o'clock shadow sets in he's back to being a man #science



— Holden (@Holden114) April 18, 2016



On some level all of this is rather funny. But it reinforces the point of my original article. Trans access laws demand that businesses allow trans women into women’s locker rooms but do not define who is and is not trans. Is Ford suggesting that a gym owner can legally exclude a trans woman from a locker room because he has short hair and a man’s watch? All kinds of women, trans and otherwise, have short hair and wear men’s watches.

If the LGBT editor at Think Progress can’t manage to come up with a reasonable definition of who is and is not transgendered, then how is a gym manager supposed to do it? Or a police officer responding to complaints from women? Ford’s certainty that the person in the image is not a transgender woman is laughable. The idea that he can look at someone and on that basis determine his or her gender is literally the opposite of what he has been saying for years.

The simple fact is that Ford and his allies in the fight for transgender access to bathrooms and locker rooms do not have the slightest idea who is and who is not trans. They never have. This has always been sophistry. This has always been an attempt to legitimize a delusion. This has always been an effort to pigeonhole men and women into gender stereotypes. Today, inadvertently, Ford proved it.

So, just to recap. Things that make you a man: Facial hair. Short hair. Arm hair. A man’s watch. Things that don’t make you a man: Having a penis. — Zack Ford

Drop The T From LGBT,"The post-marriage culture war is asymmetrical in the group known as LGBT. Gay, lesbian, and bisexual activists have carried the rainbow banner for transgenders for issues that truly matter, such as employment and housing. Now the time has come for a genuine sanity check for them to stop enabling kookier parts of the trans agenda.

The current bathroom policy debate illuminates the growing gap between the concerns of the transgender community and of the LGB community. Perhaps those who favor gay marriage do not want any part of enabling pedophiles in wigs having easier access to kids in bathrooms.

Trans activists paint the entire LGBT group in an unsympathetic light when they lobby for laws to criminalize such trivialities as misusing pronouns, as passed recently in New York City. Practical LGB members might want to take this opportunity to disentangle themselves from the lunacy of today’s trans-rights movement. This will disassociate their movement in the public eye from people whom research shows have high incidents of psychological disorders linked with their transgender expression, and offers an opportunity to protect transgender people from being exploited by high-priced medical quacks.

The differences between the groups now seem glaring. Let’s list a few.

Difference 1: Same-Sex Attraction vs. Gender Perception

Many transgenders are not homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual. Unlike people who identify as LGB, transgenders suffer from self-deception disorders (gender dysphoria). They are convinced that they are in the wrong body, and with the help of enablers and affirmers of their delusion, undergo drastic body-mutilating surgeries to enhance the deception and deny the plain and simple truth of their gender. While some LGB people may be transgender, too, the majority are not.

Difference 2: Bathroom Access

The transgender public restroom issue, a hot topic in the news today, is exclusively a transgender cause not shared by those who are lesbian, gay, or bisexual. Transgender bills being debated at the state and local levels exclusively address gender identity and have nothing to do with sexual preference. This includes bills to legally change one’s gender marker on one’s birth certificate without surgically altering the appearance of one’s genitals. It also includes bills to allow any man to use women’s public restrooms and locker rooms if he says he feels like a woman—no surgery or birth-record change required.

Gay men might care that deviants invoke such laws to indulge their sexual perversions, bringing a backlash on the LGBT community.

Many gay men don’t care whether transgenders get access to the public restroom of the opposite sex. But gay men might care that pedophiles and deviants invoke such laws to indulge their sexual perversions in public restrooms and in doing so, bring a backlash on the LGBT community. Most women, lesbian or not, prefer to keep a man who has his toolbox intact out of the women’s restrooms and locker rooms, no matter how much he insists he is a woman. This applies particularly to women who have been sexually assaulted in the past.

The freedom to change genders without surgery and to enter gender-segregated spaces is an open invitation to perverts to use public restrooms to indulge their sexual corruptions at the expense of women and girls.

Difference 3: Mental Disorders

Studies show the transgender population has a wide range of co-existing mental disorders. Besides the obvious gender dysphoria, they suffer at high rates from a wide range of undiagnosed and untreated mental issues: body dysmorphic disorders, sexual fetishes like autogynephilia (arousal at the thought of being a woman), and masturbation addictions, to name just a few.

The recommended treatment for depression, anxiety, or other mental disorders is not gender surgery.

“We found 90% of these diverse patients had at least one other significant form of psychopathology,” says a 2009 study by the Department of Psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University. The psychopathologies found were “mood and anxiety regulation and adaption in the world.”

A 2011 long-term follow-up of transsexual persons undergoing sex-reassignment surgery concluded: “Persons with transsexualism, after sex reassignment, have considerably higher risks for mortality, suicidal behaviour, and psychiatric morbidity than the general population.”

People who are transgender have a higher risk of suicidal behavior, and suicide is known to be caused by depression and anxiety. The recommended treatment for depression, anxiety, or other mental disorders is not gender surgery.

The staggering number of co-existing disorders in the gender dysphoric population sets the transgender group apart from the lesbian, gay, and bisexual population. The deep psychological and psychiatric depression that results from the self-deception of gender identity and the untreated mental disorders has been the major contributor to transgenders’ position at the top of the most-likely-to commit-suicide list.

An Opportunity for LGB to Actually Help the T

Now that we’ve discussed some major points on which the trans agenda does not align with gay and bisexual priorities, let’s further discuss how gay, lesbian, and bisexual activists can benefit trans people by shifting their advocacy.

First, this will help reduce the political pressure that is currently resulting in gender dysphoric people being pushed into treatments that hurt rather than help them.

Perhaps when transgenders are considered apart from LGB there can be a fresh new insurgence of improved psychiatric screening and treatment.

The high rate of mental disorders among transgenders has been well-documented for 50 years. But instead of diagnosing and treating those issues first, rushing the gender dysphoric person into hormones and surgery ignores any childhood trauma or other mental disorders that might be masquerading as gender dysphoria and leaps directly to the extreme measures of injecting cross-gender hormones and scheduling surgery to remove the original “equipment.”

In my own case, I was approved for surgery after one session with a gender specialist. That was in the 1980s. Today, according to the letters I receive, approval still happens that quickly, and the other psychological problems are deemed not important.

Perhaps when transgenders are considered apart from LGB there can be a fresh new insurgence of improved psychiatric screening, effective diagnoses of the underlining comorbid disorders, and effective treatment that does not include hormones and gender reassignment. That should reduce the number of suicides in this population.

Here is some more information about the history of medical treatments for trans people to help LGB folks understand why they need to step up now, and have done so in the past.

Trans Has Long Been Recognized as a Psychological Issue

In the United States, the practice of treating the gender-confused with hormones and surgery was started by Dr. Harry Benjamin, an endocrinologist and sexologist who is credited with coining the term transsexualism. Benjamin’s New York gender clinic was in full swing during the 1970s. From that clinic emerged some of the first signs that unhappiness with one’s gender and the desire to change gender largely evolved from untreated mental disorders, which hormones and surgery did nothing to relieve.

‘Whatever surgery did, it did not fulfill a basic yearning for something that is difficult to define.’

The leading endocrinologist at Benjamin’s clinic in the 1970s, a homosexual named Dr. Charles Ihlenfeld, administered cross-gender hormone therapy to some 500 transgenders over a six-year period. He came to the conclusion that the desire to change genders most likely stemmed from powerful psychological factors, and he left endocrinology (and Benjamin’s clinic) to begin a residency in psychiatry, a field in which he felt he could be a help to people with gender identity issues. Ihlenfeld said in “Transgender Subjectivities: A Clinician’s Guide,” “Whatever surgery did, it did not fulfill a basic yearning for something that is difficult to define. This goes along with the idea that we are trying to treat superficially something that is much deeper.”

Almost simultaneously, similar findings were coming from Johns Hopkins Hospital’s gender clinic, an early provider of gender reassignment surgery. Dr. Paul McHugh joined the clinic as the director of psychiatry and behavioral science in the mid-1970s and asked Dr. Jon Meyer, director of the clinic at the time, to conduct a thorough study of the outcomes of the clinic’s patients who underwent gender reassignment at the clinic.

McHugh says, “[Those who underwent surgery] were little changed in their psychological condition. They had much the same problems with relationships, work, and emotions as before. The hope that they would emerge now from their emotional difficulties to flourish psychologically had not been fulfilled.” These two different reports came to the same conclusion in the late 1970s.

Research Has Continued to Make This Case

Fast-forward to July 30, 2004, when a review of 100 medical studies delivered another powerful rebuke of surgical genders. David Batty wrote in The Guardian in the UK:

There is no conclusive evidence that sex change operations improve the lives of transsexuals, with many people remaining severely distressed and even suicidal after the operation, according to a medical review conducted exclusively for Guardian Weekend tomorrow.



The review of more than 100 international medical studies of post-operative transsexuals by the University of Birmingham’s aggressive research intelligence facility (Arif) found no robust scientific evidence that gender reassignment surgery is clinically effective.

Some have argued that transgenderism could be due to genetic factors, in a parallel argument to those suggesting a “gay gene.” So far, research has found no such thing for transsexuals. Studies from 2013 and 2009 showed no alterations in the DNA of the main sex-determining genes in transsexuals, proving born-male transgenders are normal males; not a smidgeon of abnormality in their genetic make-up causes them to be transgender. Gender issues are not inherent to the genetic makeup.

Transgender People’s Lives Are On the Line

Four studies published in 2016 alone show that nothing has changed since Ihlenfeld left Benjamin’s gender clinic in the 1970s: Mental disorders are prevalent among the transgender population.

The most commonly occurring disorders were major depressive episode, suicidality, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and alcohol dependence.

A study published in JAMA Pediatrics in March 2016 shows a high prevalence of psychiatric diagnoses in a sample of 298 young transgender women aged 16 through 29 years. More than 40 percent had coexisting mental health or substance dependence diagnoses. One in five had two or more psychiatric diagnoses. The most commonly occurring disorders were major depressive episode, suicidality, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, alcohol dependence, and non-alcohol psychoactive substance use dependence.

The study concluded that improved access to medical and psychological care “are urgently needed to address mental health and substance dependence disorders in this population.”

Another study comparing 20 Lebanese transgender participants to 20 control subjects (the mean age of both groups was 23.55 years) reported that transgender individuals suffer from more psychiatric pathologies compared to the general population. More than half had active suicidal thoughts; 45 percent had a major depressive episode.

The introduction of the third study says there is no consensus among medical professionals on the early medical treatment (giving puberty-suppressing drugs) for children and adolescents with gender dysphoria. The current adolescent treatment guidelines published by The Endocrine Society and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health recommend suppressing puberty with drugs until age 16, after which cross-sex hormones may be given, and deferring surgery until the individual is at least 18 years old. Some medical teams say these guidelines are too liberal and others say they are too limiting, which shows the wide range of opinions.

There is no consensus among medical professionals on giving puberty-suppressing drugs to children and adolescents with gender dysphoria.

This study aimed to gather input from pediatric endocrinologists, psychologists, psychiatrists, and ethicists—both those in favor and those opposed to early treatment—to further the ethical debate. The results showed no consensus on many basic topics of childhood gender dysphoria and insufficient research to support any recommendations for childhood treatments, including the currently published guidelines. Nevertheless, many treatment teams using the guidelines are exploring the possibility of lowering the current age limits.

In the meantime, children are being given experimental treatment that has life-long consequences. Of the 38 referrals for gender dysphoria to the Pediatric Endocrinology Clinic at the University School of Medicine in Indianapolis, more than half had psychiatric and/or developmental comorbidities, says the fourth 2016 study.

T and LGB Are Distinct Populations

Reading these studies brings me to the conclusion that “T” is very different from LGB. The scientific community doesn’t comingle LGB with T in research studies because they know the obvious truth: people who are transgender are different from those who are homosexual.

Time to pull the “T” from LGBT. No good reason remains to co-mingle people with mental disorders with people who are homosexual. Nor is it necessary to continue to give social credibility to this tiny group of delusional people who need psychiatric or psychotherapy first and foremost, not pronoun protection or gender reassignment.

Speaking for the non-transgendered or recovered transgendered among us, I am through with the political correctness traps of preferred pronouns and allowing men access to women’s facilities and activities. It’s time to express our compassion for this group and stop participating in their denial. True compassion is acknowledging that serious mental disorders are found in this population and insisting that the medical community stop treating all gender-dysphoric people with hormones and gender reassignment before caring for their mental health.

A good first step is to remove the T from LGBT.

Counselors Need Conscience Protections Like Tennessee’s,"Religious freedom issues have found their way into the headlines quite a lot lately, and the news is nearly always bad. “Gov. Mike Pence signs ‘religious freedom’ bill in private” quickly followed by “Gov. Mike Pence signs RFRA fix.” “Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoes Senate Bill 1062.” “Nathan Deal vetoes Georgia’s ‘religious liberty’ bill.” “How the Atlanta Fire Chief’s Christian Views Cost Him His Job.” “‘Sweet Cakes’ Owners’ Bank Accounts Seized as Damages for Refusing to Bake Wedding Cake for Lesbian Couple.”

Victories for the religious conscience are few and far between. A lot has happened since Hobby Lobby v. Burwell, the Supreme Court decision that protects Hobby Lobby from having to pay for employee birth control and abortifacients.

In such an atmosphere, Tennessee’s House Bill 1840 comes as a breath of fresh air. Signed by Gov. Bill Haslam this past Wednesday, the new law protects counselors who want to practice without violating their consciences. It stipulates that counselors can refuse services to a client if they feel providing services will violate their sincerely held beliefs.

Significantly, this doesn’t apply in cases of imminent risk of homicide, suicide, or self-harm. Also, the objecting counselor has to take steps to refer the client elsewhere. But they can do so knowing they won’t be sued, charged with a crime, or penalized for exercising their First Amendment rights.

Confessions of a Conservative Counselor

To a religious conservative social worker like myself, these are glad tidings indeed. There’s more of us than you might think. But still I find my perspective is alien to both the Right and Left. So allow me to introduce myself.

These convictions keep me going in work that can be difficult, time-consuming, emotionally taxing, underpaid, and often thankless.

I’m a long-time Christian and recently baptized Catholic, and I consider my faith my highest priority. It can’t be confined to four walls and some stained glass windows on a Sunday morning. It can’t be separated from my professional life. It can’t be separated from anything. It’s what motivates me in my practice.

I think Jesus meant it when he said, “As ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.” I believe our highest purpose in life is to serve others in whatever capacity we can, and to support one another in carrying our separate crosses. These convictions keep me going in work that can be difficult, time-consuming, emotionally taxing, underpaid, and often thankless.

I also follow traditional Christian teachings on human behavior, specifically sex and marriage. I believe sex should be limited to marriage, marriage consists of one man and one woman, and our anatomy dictates our gender. For me, these aren’t arbitrary commandments delivered from a disembodied voice in the sky. Nor do they represent a dead code from an ancient text. Rather, they’re living and objective truths, written by God into our very nature and borne out by human experience, empirical data, and philosophical reasoning. If we follow these principles, we will experience greater health and well-being both individually and collectively.

God’s love doesn’t stop where LGBT starts. I’ve worked with plenty of these folks without any conflict arising.

How do these latter beliefs influence my practice as a therapist? To the outside observer, probably not at all. I don’t preach to my clients, and I go in knowing I’ll be dealing with people who lead troubled and sinful lives, as mine has been at times. My role is to support them, help them find greater hope and clarity, and navigate with them through confusion and suffering to a more peaceful state of life. I can do that without ever uttering an “Amen” in their presence, although I pray for them often on my own time.

God’s love doesn’t stop where LGBT starts. I’ve worked with plenty of these folks without any conflict arising. I’ve listened to their troubles, given them tools to battle anxiety and depression, guided them in parenting their children more effectively, and helped with other challenges. These encounters have been positive and mutually supportive. I’ve had no cause to share my own beliefs with them, and neither condoned nor condemned their preferences. As any decent counselor knows, caring and empathy do not equal affirmation.

Conflicts of the Counselor’s Conscience

As it happens, the new Tennessee law wouldn’t protect me from working with the LGBT population, even if that were my goal. It doesn’t allow counselors to deny services based on a client’s identity, but rather “as to goals, outcomes, or behaviors that conflict.” In other words, it’s not about who you are, but rather what you want to accomplish.

I don’t want to have to help a pregnant teenage girl obtain an abortion.

I’ll gladly work with anyone who goes by gay, lesbian, or transgender, ethnic Albanian, deaf, bilingual, introvert, heroin addict, divorcee, Southerner, Seahawks fan, metalhead, lover of Will Ferrell movies, or any other label he or she might choose. None of that affects my overall mission, and they’re all worthy of whatever help I might have to offer them.

Here’s what I fear. I don’t want the law to coerce me to assist a confused teenage boy in trying to live as a girl, aiding and abetting a falsehood that I believe will damage his present and future mental health. I don’t want to be forced to counsel two women in sustaining a romantic relationship that, in my view, ultimately harms both of them. I don’t want to have to help a pregnant teenage girl obtain an abortion. I don’t want to advise an unwed couple in how to achieve a more fulfilling sex life. I also don’t want to be driven out of my profession for declining all of the above.

Will a Counselor Who Disagrees With You Help Much?

Opponents of the Tennessee law will happily denounce this perspective as discrimination and bigotry. But I have to ask: Why would you want me to be forced to counsel people against my conscience? Who would benefit from such an arrangement? Wouldn’t my prospective client and I both lose?

Why would you want me to be forced to counsel people against my conscience? Who would benefit from such an arrangement?

I’ve recently stopped accepting referrals to work with young children. I love young children—just not counseling them. I don’t like the therapeutic approach of toys, games, and imaginative play, and I have colleagues who do, so I pass them along. That’s not bigotry. It’s called best practice. Why, then, would anyone want to require me to counsel in concerns outside of my sphere of moral comfort, proficiency, and interest?

I anticipate the responses. I’ve seen some colorful ones, but they boil down to: “Jesus would never deny help to someone who needed it! If that’s how you feel, then you shouldn’t be in this profession in the first place!” I could dispute that at length, on logical, professional, practical, or theological grounds. But let me instead opt for a personal appeal.

I’ve helped a lot of people in my still-young career. I know this because they’ve told me so. I’m still humbled, even a little mystified, every time a tearful client offers me a heartfelt thanks for having given him an hour to unburden himself. What have I really done for them, I think? All I did was listen. Then, with some sorrow, it dawns on me that they might never have had a patient, listening, and sympathetic ear. That’s all they needed, and nobody else was there. Then I feel blessed to have been able to provide this simple yet profound service. Anyone in my field should be familiar with this sensation.

I’ve helped children cope with abuse, addicts kick heroin, teenage girls stop cutting themselves, delinquent youth stay out of jail, couples mend their broken relationships, and suicidal people find reasons to live. I don’t say that to boast, nor do I claim any great professional ability or personal virtue because of it. I attribute most of my successes to “right person, right place, right time.” But I was the right person, in the right place, at the right time, to make a difference in someone’s life. I’ll do so again. I’ve also managed it, either in spite of or because of, my Christian convictions.

Would it be better if I’d kept my bigoted, hateful worldview out of the profession, and left these people without help?

Would it be better if I’d kept my bigoted, hateful worldview out of the profession, and left these people without help? Should I get out of the field now, and prevent any good I might do in the future?

Another consideration: A great many of our clients are themselves religious, and often traditional Christians. Again, I don’t preach. But if clients are motivated by their belief in God or the Bible, I feel competent to use that as a point of connection, exploration, and insight. I’ve seen this have an impact. I’ve also seen atheist coworkers provide treatment for religious clients. They didn’t refer them elsewhere. Instead they nodded, smiled, then later ridiculed their beliefs behind their backs. Surely these people deserve better.

What’s in Your Conscience?

Although I’ve discussed my own Christian conscience here, the law doesn’t specify religious or LGBT issues at all. Rather, it was made to protect counselors’ “sincerely held beliefs.” Opponents claim the law is a thinly veiled effort to protect Christians with qualms about serving LGBT causes.

Consider the possibility that a few years from now, something you sincerely believe will be classified as ‘on the wrong side of history.’

They’re right, of course, but also missing the point. LGBTs have proven a litigious people. Christians, whether they be bakers or photographers or counselors, feel embattled, and want their representatives to enact defensive measures. When we feel threatened, we’re prompted to protect ourselves. This is basic cause and effect, nothing sinister afoot.

But the principle applies to all. A wall built against the Gauls will serve just as well against the Goths or the Vandals. Let’s not forget the first Religious Freedom Restoration Act was passed in the 1990s by no less of a Bible-thumping conservative than President Bill Clinton, in an effort to protect Native Americans using peyote for religious rituals. Everyone should value freedom of conscience (provided they have a conscience, that is.)

The Tennessee law protects the progressive, the Muslim, or the vegan as much as the Catholic. Suppose you’re an atheist not comfortable with counseling a religious client striving to connect with God. You don’t have to. A proudly gay therapist could pass on someone whose goal is to overcome same-sex attraction. Are you a pacifist uneasy with advising a high school senior on a potential career in the military? Refer him on.

Five years ago, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton both favored traditional marriage. Until about yesterday, the idea of an anatomical male sharing a girls’ locker room seemed insane. Consider the possibility that a few years from now, something you sincerely believe will be classified as “on the wrong side of history.” If that day comes, take heart: you have a home in Tennessee.

The Truth About North Carolina’s Bathroom Bill,"Overblown outrage and feigned offense have been the overwhelming reaction to North Carolina’s common-sense House Bill 2, which requires individuals to use the public bathrooms and showers that correspond to their birth sex.

Celebrity after celebrity, corporate giants, and even U.S. governments with similar policies have boycotted or threatened to boycott the Tarheel State because of a perceived and unfounded perception that this law is discriminatory to the LGBT community. The Obama administration has upped the ante by threatening to pull $4.8 billion in federal taxpayers’ funds from the state unless it repeals the bill by May 9. State officials have said they will not do so.

This outrage has been directed toward North Carolina when 29 other states do not offer special protections to people who use the LGBT designation. The part making liberals pull their hair out is the section known as the “bathroom bill.”

This section of HB2 simply and justly states that persons must use the bathroom and locker room that identifies with the gender on their birth certificates. It also states that municipalities requiring different sexes to share public accommodations is inconsistent with North Carolina’s law and constitution. This increases legal protection for schools, civic organizations, and especially small business owners.

The majority of media outlets are failing to report a tremendous amount of information that surrounds this law. Those omissions are extremely detrimental to those of us who are married to common sense as a way of life.

Blame how North Carolina is being portrayed nationally can sit many places, but one of those places is definitely not Gov. Pat McCrory’s office. The North Carolina legislature, with the exception of changing how discrimination lawsuits are filed (now done federally within 180 days) also bears little blame. I will explain why.

Reason 1: The North Carolina Constitution Forbids Charlotte’s Actions

Many will, for their convenience, call the constitution an evolving document. I understand the point, but until the constitution evolves by amendment or legal interpretation, municipalities cannot simply break its tenets. To that point, the NC constitution for 180 years “has held to the public policy that issues of labor and trade would be decided on a statewide basis instead of locally. And so, without any legal authority whatsoever,” says Rep. Paul Stam, the city of Charlotte decided to go against that. It enacted an ordinance requiring all government and business bathrooms and showers to be open to all sexes.

The Charlotte city council had no authority to enact its ordinance, much less threaten tens of thousands of businesses with fines and minor punishments if they didn’t comply.

The Charlotte city council had no authority to enact its ordinance, much less threaten tens of thousands of businesses with fines and minor punishments if they didn’t comply. They were threatening 23,000 businesses and nonprofits, including small “mom and pop” establishments, with fines and other minor punishments if they didn’t conform to that policy. Such threats are tyrannical when it was known that the ordinance they were discussing was beyond their purview.

This constitutional standard is not unique to North Carolina. North Carolina is one of at least 37 states like Virginia where cities and towns cannot pass rules or regulations that exceed the authority given to them by the state. This practice assures that laws and policies are consistent throughout a state and do not change with every border or small town.

Minimum wages, labor policy, and even union statutes are set at the state level, and the Charlotte city council knew this. So in passing the bathroom ordinance, Charlotte had exceeded its authority by setting rules that had ramifications beyond the city. They were going to unjustly punish non-compliant entities as of April 1, 2016, if the NC legislature failed to act.

Reason 2: The Legislature Offered Charlotte a Compromise

Much like our Congress in DC yielding to the Obama administration time and again on budget and other issues, the NC legislature and even the governor’s office offered advance notifications and compromises on the bill so it could stand without being a national circus. McCrory wrote council members that the bathroom provision would likely cause “immediate state legislative intervention.” So the knowledge of what would occur in Raleigh was known before they attempted this power grab.

It clearly was their intent to force this bathroom issue out in the open and claim the LGBT community as victims.

The Charlotte City Council narrowly defeated in March 2015 a measure resembling the one it later passed, even after removing a section that would have allowed bathroom use based on gender identity. Council members voted to remove the bathroom provision from the ordinance. But two council members, John Autry and LaWana Mayfield, voted against that version of the ordinance out of “principle,” feeling it was only beneficial to have the full sweeping legislation enacted instead of accepting the council’s version, which would have extended many protections to the LGBT community. It clearly was their intent to force this bathroom issue out in the open and claim the LGBT community as victims.

Local officials later announced that transgender people could use the bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity in city- and county-owned facilities. Yes, that is correct: Charlotte already had enacted the gender identity and transgender clauses for city and county facilities, and this recent ordinance was simply the final push to force those same standards on private business owners and all public accommodations.

Various members of the legislature reached out to the council before its vote, asking that the “bathroom/locker room” provision be removed to avoid any possible public battle. The recommendation to create unisex facilities was additionally mentioned. We know the answer to those requests was a blatant no. Yet conservatives are the ones being portrayed as stiff, harsh, and difficult to work with.

Reason 3: Charlotte’s Council Sought Notoriety

Major news outlets have failed to mention this was not the first time an ordinance of this type had come up in Charlotte. November 24, 2014, saw Scott Bishop, of LGBT political organization MeckPAC, during the Charlotte city council’s dinner meeting mention he had already spoken with City Attorney Bob Hageman and the Charlotte Mecklenburg Community Relations Committee about adding five categories, including transgender and gender identity and expression, to the city’s non-discrimination list. The council then ordered Hageman to write up said changes for its later review.

This entire ordinance was an enormous exercise in special interests compromising the rule of law.

Democratic Mayor Dan Clodfelter expressed support for adding gay and transgender persons to the list of protected classes. Subsequently the city council held a public hearing in advance of the vote, which drew 117 speakers. The ordinance received an amendment removing restrooms, locker rooms, showers, and changing rooms from the proposed changes. The amended ordinance was voted down 6-5, mainly because some Democrats felt it did not go far enough.

Fast-forward to 2015, when Charlotte elected a new mayor who openly supports the full failed ordinance, and two new Democratic members, Julie Eiselt and James Mitchell, who openly support the initiative. Then, partially based on the U.S. Department of Education’s 53-page guidance document for schools that receive federal funding through Title IX, the emboldened Left decided to bring back the issue.

That guidance says “discrimination prohibition extends to claims of discrimination based on gender identity or failure to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity” and “the actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity of the parties does not change a school’s obligations.” The Charlotte city council interpreted this to mean the transgendered should have the right to use facilities that correspond to how they view themselves. I wonder if that means Rachel Dolezal, a white woman who lived as a black woman, can also state that on her drivers’ license and have her birth certificate changed.

Notice what this information infers. The council and city LGBT activists were continually working to bring this ordinance into effect. Meetings and orders were given to start it in motion before the public had any knowledge of it. This entire ordinance was an enormous exercise in special interests compromising the rule of law. The Charlotte mayor and city council contrived North Carolina’s current place in public opinion, and although the law supports the governor and legislature’s response, the media will never reveal that fact.

Reason 4: Attorney General Roy Cooper Has Abandoned His Duty

How many times have we seen the media rip a person to shreds for not following the law because of a religious or other deeply held belief? Think of the ardent demands for those with an objection to gay marriage to do their jobs or quit. Why has that not applied to NC Attorney General Roy Cooper, who is refusing to enforce HB2?

Can he passionately defend the laws when he has decided to criticize them and said standing up for the laws of NC is a waste of time and money?

This isn’t an isolated abandonment of his duties, either. He has sat for four terms as the state attorney general and defended Democratic failures and leaders in court even after they were out of office. Cooper fought doggedly in court for former governor Mike Easley, who ordered at least three public information officers to destroy emails and communications in violation of state law. Cooper fought for the State Bureau of Investigation despite its repeated failures. The SBI withheld or distorted evidence in more than 200 cases at the expense of potentially innocent men and women, according to the Raleigh News and Observer. That and other issues gain Cooper’s dedicated support.

His position makes him the lawyer for the people of North Carolina. He defends the state’s positions and laws, which normally means the state public officials and policies. Instead of him fulfilling that duty, NC has had to hire an outside firm to fight the U.S. Department of Justice over voter ID laws. Cooper’s public statements against the law are actually in the DOJ’s briefs and complaints.

Can he passionately defend the laws when he has decided to criticize them and said standing up for the laws of NC is a waste of time and money? He refused to defend the state after more than 61 percent of the population voted against gay marriage. McCrory has called on Cooper, a Democrat now running for governor in 2016, to “battle the ACLU and President Obama’s attempt to force local districts to open sex-specific locker rooms and bathrooms to individuals of the opposite biological sex” by joining a federal civil rights case involving a 16-year-old transgender teen in Virginia. Cooper will not do his job, for his own reasons.

Remember, in North Carolina the General Assembly has the ultimate power over municipalities. Legislators could strike down an entire ordinance, or they could eliminate the provision that allows for bathroom flexibility. They are asking the attorney general to enforce the law, and he will not. If Cooper had acted on his job description and not his opinion, the Charlotte city council would have trod down this illegal path less boldly.

Consider some ramifications of the ordinance that violate the NC constitution. Under the ordinance, it would have been illegal:

For the government of Charlotte to do business with anyone who had not allowed shared restroom use for gender identity disagreements; To deny “the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of a place of public accommodation” based on the gender identity category; and to make and circulate any statements or signs indicating that public accommodation will be refused based on those categories (notifying individuals that restrooms are not shared).

Think of being fined or losing contracts because you didn’t allow males and females to share locker rooms or restrooms. A third offense against this ordinance was to result in jail time. Even building a unisex facility would not have qualified under this ordinance, unless it was a business’s only accommodation. It required any single-sex facilities to be opened to the opposite sex.

The ordinance also struck down a section exempting the YMCA, YWCA, and similar dormitories from a law ensuring equal access to services and facilities based solely on sex. The attorney general could have at any time expressed to local governments the multitude of problems these tenets contained, but he did not. His inaction and inefficiency while seeking personal promotion deserve more blame than does the NC governor or legislature.

There are more reasons LGBT advocates are wrong in this case, but we will hold with the aforementioned for now. The NC legislature did make a mistake by going beyond the scope of the bathroom issue and addressing the way discrimination is reported and filed in North Carolina. The change principally stops those who feel they are discriminated against from going to a local court. They now must file with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. They previously had three years to file, and now only have 180 days. The damages under NC law were uncapped, and now under federal law the cap is $300,000.

Those parameters were a mistake and the governor has addressed that directly. The much larger issue is the formulation, execution, and misinformation about the process in Charlotte that caused HB2 to be written and passed. There is a lot of blame for the attacks on the Tarheel State, and most of it shouldn’t be placed in the capital city of Raleigh, but further down I-85 with the leaders of the city of Charlotte and their gamble against common sense.

A Gay-Friendly Shooting Club Just Won Big Gun Rights Victory,"A federal judge ruled on Tuesday that a key provision of Washington DC’s concealed carry law was unconstitutional, and ordered DC police to stop requiring residents to prove they have a “good reason” to be issued a concealed carry permit.

The plaintiff, Matthew Grace, is a district gun owner and member of The Pink Pistols, a shooting group that “honors diversity and is open to all shooters regardless of sexual orientation,” with dozens of chapters nationwide.

“We teach queers to shoot. Then we teach others that we have done so,” their website states.

Armed queers don’t get bashed. We change the public perception of the sexual minorities, such that those who have in the past perceived them as safe targets for violence and hateful acts — beatings, assaults, rapes, murders — will realize that that now, a segment of the sexual minority population is now armed and effective with those arms. Those arms are also concealed, so they do not know which ones are safe to attack, and which are not…which they can harm as they have in the past, and which may draw a weapon and fight back.

As Reason.com has reported, the group formed partly due to stories of openly gay individuals being threatened with physical violence — like Tom G. Palmer, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, who was able to scare away a pack of homophobic thugs because he was packing heat.

VICE reports:

Tom Palmer, a gay libertarian, was walking to dinner with a co-worker in 1982 when he was told by a group of passing homophobes that he would be killed and nobody would ever find his body. Walking slowly away, and then running, Palmer was pursued by the gang for about a hundred feet until he turned to face them with the handgun his mother had given him. His aggressors retreated when they saw the gun, and Palmer was safe—the gun may very well have saved his life.

Since the altercation in 1982, Palmer has been on the forefront of the gun rights cause. In 2014, he sued the city over its ban on all firearms in public, and won. In the Palmer decision, Judge Frederick Scullin deemed the District’s ban on carrying open and concealed carry firearms outside of the home to be unconstitutional, citing legal precedent from a prior Supreme Court case, Heller vs. D.C.

Palmer was also a plaintiff in the Heller case, in which the Supreme Court determined that the city’s requirement that residents must keep all guns kept inside their homes nonfunctional, by either disassembling them or with a trigger lock, violated citizens’ Second Amendment rights.

In 2008, The Pink Pistols filed an amicus brief on behalf of the plaintiffs in the Heller case, explaining that restricting the right to bear arms disproportionately affects those who are often targets for hate crimes — thus the right to bear arms is essential for the LGBT community. Additionally, the brief stated that legal precedent established in Lawrence v. Texas, which allows gay and lesbian individuals to participate in same-sex relationships in the privacy of their own homes without government intervention, can only be upheld if they can defend themselves from a hate crime.

Laws, such as D.C. Code § 7-2507.02, that prevent the use of firearms for self-protection in the home are of particular concern to members of the LGBT community, because historically hate crimes based on sexual-orientation bias have most commonly occurred in the home or residence.



By effectively preventing LGBT individuals from defending themselves through possession of firearms in their own homes, persons motivated to attack LGBT individuals may do so with the confidence that their intended victims will be unarmed. Such a result not only conflicts with the natural law right of man to act in his own self-defense, as recognized by the framers, but jeopardizes the privacy rights of LGBT individuals recognized by this Court in Lawrence, when the exercise of such rights makes one an unarmed target.

Openly gay individuals have successfully fought for three of the latest major gun-rights victories in the nation’s capitol by pointing out the obvious: that everyone ought to be able to defend him- or herself from bodily harm, a right afforded to everyone by the Second Amendment.

The LGBT Movement Will Self-Destruct,"I was just six years old when it happened. I showed up for the first grade, fresh-faced and ready to learn, only to have my innocence shattered by a monster from the swamps of expressive individualism. In the dark recesses of my memory, he has remained nameless through all these decades. Some Google searches enabled me to find him: inventive spelling.

Apparently, “inventive spelling” has been controversial for some time as a component of “natural child” educational curricula. I’m not sure how I, a young Idahoan, came to be subjected to it, but I clearly remember being encouraged to decide whether I was a “girl,” “gurl,” or “grrrrrl.” Hooray for creativity! Why shackle yourself to the tyrannical dictates of conventional spelling?

This theory seems to have fizzled in most schools, possibly because it’s idiotic. Words have conventional spellings for a reason: their purpose is to communicate. If we encourage kids to form bad habits, it will be that much harder for them to become capable writers later. This theory’s heyday was evidently brief, but still, it left its mark. My classmates and I can thank our lucky stars that by the time we got to college, spell checkers had come along to cover our shame.

Bad ideas do die, eventually. At their peak this can be hard to believe. Whether it’s Malthusian population controls, global temperature freak-outs, low-fat diets, or disco, it often seems that idiocy seems unassailable until suddenly it isn’t. A page turns, and the emperor has no clothes, as his folly becomes a cautionary tale for future generations.

Here is my prediction. Within my lifetime, the LGBT movement will die. It will be remembered not as a Selma moment, but as a Salem moment: a period of collective insanity.

Eventually, Nature Comes Roaring Back

Whether the memory of this period evokes mild derision or deep shame will likely depend on these next few years. It’s still possible that the madness might recede and leave gays, lesbians, and religious conservatives all free to live peaceful and productive lives, knowing their fundamental rights will be respected even where their beliefs and lifestyle choices aren’t. Less optimistically, the early twenty-first century could be remembered as a time when any or all of those groups were harshly persecuted, potentially leaving deep scars in our social memory.

Either way, the movement will die. How do we know? Predicting the demise of the LGBT movement may seem rash in the present moment, as North Carolina prepares to battle the U.S. Department of Justice and Washington issues edicts demanding submission from every public school in America. But gender ideology is too incoherent and too inimical to real human good. It cannot outlast the moral indignation of the present hour.

On some level, even its most ardent advocates may intuit this. Their desperation to push the boundaries as far as possible, as quickly as possible, may evidence the zeal of the terminally ill. Everything must be done today, because there is no tomorrow.

This is not an invitation to relax. Foolish ideas do eventually self-destruct, but they can do a lot of damage along the way. We also should not assume that the eventual collapse will precipitate a widespread resurgence of common sense. The evil fruits of the Sexual Revolution will likely plague us for the foreseeable future, potentially assuming a whole range of dystopian forms.

Still, we can worry more productively about the next chapter when we recognize that this one will pass. The gender ideologies of the present moment just don’t have what it takes to stand the test of time.

Powerful Parents Reject Harmful Ideas

If this seems implausible, consider that the past half-century really has not been a tale of near-unbroken moral decline. Some changes (like the introduction of artificial contraceptives and the embrace of no-fault divorce) seem here to stay. Other bad ideas, like open marriage, proved so unworkable that they were largely rejected. We have also seen particular problems mitigated through a concerted social response, as when Americans overwhelmingly agreed they didn’t want unmarried teenagers getting pregnant.

Historical trends would suggest that society’s wealthier and better-educated tend to reject life patterns quickly when it becomes clear they beget widespread misery and dysfunction. That’s one reason marriage took a hit in the ’70s and early ’80s, but then started to recover among more educated Americans. Once it was obvious that promiscuity and chaotic family structures were harmful to all concerned, people with resources took steps to correct the problem for their own and their offspring’s sakes.

For all its legal victories, gender warriors have little to show for themselves with respect to the most significant of milestones. They have yet to demonstrate that their ideology can provide a foundation for stable, thriving sub-cultures of the sort that can endure. Enormous energy has been poured into preventing skeptics from asking the relevant questions, but that kind of subterfuge can only last for so long.

The evidence we have looks bad. A few years after Facebook gave us our 50 genders, young people flounder to explain why a short white man isn’t a tall Asian woman. We can only imagine how much worse this will be ten years from now if children nationwide are aggressively drafted into the transgendered social engineering experiment.

Same-sex coupling has been socially acceptable in mainstream society for a number of years now, but insofar as it is normalized, it’s the sort of normalization that involves coming to acknowledge that it’s really very different from traditional marriage. (That, of course, is problematic insofar as social research still resoundingly affirms that stable two-parent households are the healthiest place for kids.) Victims keep emerging from the wreckage of libertine sub-cultures. It becomes increasingly obvious, as well, that children are at far greater risk in a culture that is unwilling to encourage almost any kind of sexual restraint.

Ideas have consequences, and gender ideologues are only beginning to grapple with the fruits of theirs. Political correctness can be powerful, but people are not endlessly willing to sacrifice themselves and their loved ones to its more ruinous offerings. Lacking the wherewithal to create a healthy culture, the LGBT movement will dwindle and die.

What to Do in the Meantime

What shall we do in the meantime? My suggestions are threefold.

First, we need to take steps to protect our own children. Engaging the broader culture is important, but that task belongs to grown-ups, not six-year-olds. We must build and preserve communities in which morally important truths can be instilled at least in our own offspring. Within our communities and homes, we must shield our kids from the blight of pornography and a hyper-sexualized media, and more literally, from the sexual predators that predictably emerge when a society celebrates sexuality as a primary form of creative self-expression. Sexual appetite, once unleashed, will not consistently check itself at precisely the point when pious liberals become offended. Children will continue to be victimized. Protect yours.

Sexual appetite, once unleashed, will not consistently check itself at precisely the point when pious liberals become offended.

Next, we must continue to engage our compatriots in civil discourse concerning the body, sex, marriage, and parenting. Encourage responsible sociological research on the dynamics of non-traditional relationships and families. Keep explaining again and again that traditional sexual morality is not a rejection of persons but of behaviors that are inimical to real human good. As the dysfunction of various alternative lifestyles becomes more evident, that argument may become more plausible. In the meanwhile, we should do what we can to hold up our sub-cultures as beacons for those who are looking for alternatives to libertinism.

As the LGBT fervor starts to ebb, we should be particularly solicitous to the needs of America’s poor. We’ve seen already that privileged liberals tend to adapt their lifestyles to new data while continuing to mouth the politically correct pieties of yester-year. No one likes to be seen as the stodgy moralist, but this hypocrisy shouldn’t be allowed to stand. Poor children deserve stability just as much as wealthy ones, and we should stand ready to object if our cultural elites start adjusting their habits without changing their memes.

Perhaps the most important thing is to avoid despair. It’s difficult when our culture seems to keep finding new lows on almost a daily basis. Still, when the wheels start coming off completely, it’s worth remembering that a wheel-less vehicle is no longer able to drive. That might factor into our calculations if the vehicle in question is a critical part of our opponents’ vanguard.

Future generations are sure to ask: how could the gender revolution ever have reached such absurdities? I intend to see that day.

5 Reasons President Obama’s New Transgender School Policy Is Foolish,"On May 13, President Obama, through the power of his Department of Justice and Department of Education, declared that every public school facility should no longer have sex-distinct bathrooms, changing rooms, or showers. No facility should be restricted to either male or female. Any school that does so, his administration says, is discriminatory and violating Title IX of U.S. law.

Some have unsuccessfully tried to spin the DOJ and DOE directive as totally harm-free, but some really troubling parts of political gender theory present themselves immediately. This is the bottom-line, bare-bones consequence of the president’s dramatic and far-reaching action. Like a NASCAR race car, the thin and fragile chassis over the powerful guts of this directive is “that transgender students enjoy a supportive and nondiscriminatory school environment.” What virtuous person doesn’t want every student, regardless of his or her story, to have a supportive and nondiscriminatory school atmosphere in which to learn?

But the overwhelmingly explosive engine and forceful powertrain under this thin body is explained in the conditions of compliance section of the administration’s letter to all public schools, facilities, and educational leadership (p. 2): “As a condition of receiving Federal funds, a school agrees that it will not exclude, separate, deny benefits to, or otherwise treat differently on the basis of sex any person in its educational programs or activities…”

Two major points here. While we are told to be comforted that the president’s mandate doesn’t have the force of law, it clearly has the force of the checkbook. You certainly have the right to not go along, but your federal funding will go away. It also is not confined to transgender students, but clearly refers to “any person.”

You might think this is an extremely fearful, even irrational way to interpret President Obama’s mandate. It is not by any stretch, because of how one’s gender identity is determined according to administration’s explanation and general gender theory. Following are five primary reasons why the president’s policy is unsound and will create more problems than it solves. And these problems will be profound.

1. ‘Transgender’ Literally Means Anything to Anyone

Gender identity is defined in the administration’s directive (p. 1) as such: “Gender identity refers to an individual’s internal sense of gender. A person’s gender identity may be different from or the same as the person’s sex assigned at birth.”

Nearly all LGBT advocacy organizations define “gender identity” similarly. The concern is captured in two words: “internal sense.” Gender identity is what the person says it is. Given this, the Obama administration explains clearly on page 3 of its directive, “a school must treat students consistent with their gender identity [i.e. their internal sense of themselves] even if their education records or identification documents indicate a different sex.” The student’s subjective claim is more authoritative than any official document or biological reality, which brings us to the second point.

2. There Is No Legal, Physical, or Psychological Criteria for Being Transgender

Most people assume that being “transgender” is a diagnosable or legal category that one meets by making certain observable changes or being declared such by a medical or psychological professional. This is not the case.

One is to be accepted as transgender simply by declaring it so. Nothing in current gender theory, or in this DOE/DOJ directive, can disprove a student’s claim to be transgender and then not transgender multiple times back and forth before the school day’s lunch break. The administration merely puts its faith in the naïve assumption that all will simply be honest about their real “authentic sense of gender” when entering school restrooms and locker room showers. Any student (or shopper at Target, for instance) who is questioned need only reply in one of two ways:

1) “You’re telling me I’m not a girl?”

2) “You are violating my dignity and personal essence by questioning my own ‘internal sense of gender.’”

You see, the transgender person need not show any external confirmation of his claim. He need not be diagnosed or meet any criteria of change. If a transgender person wishes to make no outward physical change at all, that is his or her decision that everyone must honor. After all, a foundational tenet of gender theory is that the “boys-look-like-this-and-girls-look-like-that” expectation is merely an illusory social construct and unhealthy expectation that must be overthrown. (A glaring and damning contradiction in gender theory is that being male or female are merely illusory constructs. But if you are a trans man or woman, that is actually and truly who you are and you are heroically worthy of great praise in announcing this to the world.)

The policy guidelines from the U.S. Department of Education accompanying the Obama administration’s directive state this subjectivity clearly: “Schools generally rely on students’…expression of their gender identity” (see question 2, page 1).

This profound subjectivity and policy protection of it practically and legally opens all public school restrooms, showers, and locker rooms to anyone, as it would be a violation of one’s individual identity and autonomy to question the legitimacy of one’s claim of being transgender.

3. This Is About Transgender Politics, not Compassion

Most trans advocates claim that transgender students of any age should not have to face an unsafe situation when having to conduct the basic human functions of waste elimination and changing for sports activities. Who honestly disagrees with that for any student?

There is a practical answer to this that most school administrators already utilize to respect the transgender student’s safety and modesty: single-use facilities. But when school officials provide separate facilities for their trans-identified students, this is seen as discriminatory by radical trans advocates and the Obama administration. Separate is not allowed.

This indicates this is not merely about the practicality of the trans-identified student being able to do his or her business in a safe environment. It is about something much more.

4. The Safety and Modesty of the Majority Takes a Back Seat to a Minuscule Minority

The Obama administration distinctly pits the considerations of trans-identified students against the safety and comfort all other students. This is dramatic, as one of the world’s leading pro-gay think tanks puts the total population of transgender adults no higher than 0.3 percent. That is not a typo. Point three percent. Of course, the percentage of young people is much lower, and those who feel bad about using single-use facilities lower still.

It is simply unfair and unwise to tell 99.9 percent of girls that their own right to safety and dignity in the bathrooms, showers, and changing rooms of their schools is non-existent.

Certainly we cannot say the rights of the majority should squash the rights of a minority, regardless of how miniscule that minority is, but this is honestly madness. It is simply unfair and unwise to tell 99.9 percent of girls that their own right to safety and dignity in the bathrooms, showers, and changing rooms of their schools is non-existent. In fact, the Charlotte Observer’s editorial board belittlingly lectured every one of these girls that while “the thought of male genitalia in girls’ locker rooms – and vice versa – might be distressing to some” these hysterical girls should just get over it. The editors equate this natural female modesty with those who once showed antipathy toward blacks using white restrooms. This is vile and inexcusable.

As an important aside regarding safety, the confident assurance we hear from trans advocates that it is unlikely any transgender individual will abuse someone as he or she uses the facilities of the preferred sex misses the point. The concern is that any male with ill intent (or not) can enter a woman’s restroom, shower, or changing room and present his naked self under the false auspices of changing his clothes, dropping his pants to tuck in his shirt, shower after a workout, etc. Yes, extreme creepers will be arrested just as they would be in same-sex facilities, but there are many things boys and men will be able to do in the girls’ facilities that cannot be questioned but will be deeply disturbing to the average woman.

5. Leading Clinicians Do Not Recognize Children as Transgender

These policies are being driven by the unfounded assumption that children who identify with the sex opposite their biology are transgender. Those who think it unwise to allow young children to identify as the opposite sex and accordingly change their clothes, names, bedroom décor, and identity at school are shamed as unenlightened clods who are responsible for these children committing suicide one day. I have personally experienced such accusations more times than I can count. But are such people really so unenlightened?

Many of the world’s leading clinicians working with such children do not refer to them as ‘transgender’ but as gender dysphoric.

First, many of the world’s leading clinicians working with such children do not refer to them as “transgender” but as gender dysphoric. This is because the best research reveals that 75 to 98 percent of children who at some point identify as the opposite sex return to their biological sex identity at or sometime before the onset of puberty. It is not something they are, but something the overwhelming majority deal with for a period of time in childhood. Leading clinicians working in the Netherlands report “the results unequivocally showed that gender dysphoria remitted after puberty in the vast majority of children.” Thus, referring to gender dysphoric children as “transgender” is not advised by the best research.

This is primarily why the Amsterdam Gender Identity Clinic, one of the largest clinics in Europe treating gender dysphoric children, does not recommend that parents, teachers, or clinicians facilitate pre-adolescent sex transitioning:

Because most gender dysphoric children will not remain gender dysphoric through adolescence, we recommend that young children not yet make a complete social transition (different clothing, a different given name, referring to a boy as ‘her’ instead of ‘him’) before the very early stages of puberty. In making this recommendation, we aim to prevent youths with non-persisting gender dysphoria from having to make a complex change back to the role of the natal gender.

This is critical. These specialists explain that children who are facilitated by parents, teachers, and other adults in an identity transition from their biological to their perceived sex report substantial difficulty in deciding, taking actions, and explaining to others that they now desire to live according to their natal sex. They find it hard to reverse the momentum that was created for them by well-intentioned, but enabling adults. These clinicians explain:

In a qualitative follow-up study, several youths indicated how difficult it was for them to realize that they no longer wanted to live in the role of the other gender and make this clear to the people around them. …One may wonder how difficult it would be for children already living for years in an environment where no one (except for the family) is aware of the child’s natal sex to make the change back. …Parents, too, who go along with this, often do not realize that they contribute to their child’s lack of awareness of these consequences.

Dr. Richard Green, one of the oldest researchers in this field and a committed LGBT advocate within the professional associations, expressed similar concerns to The Atlantic some years ago:

Are you helping or hurting a kid by allowing them to live as the other gender? If everyone is caught up in facilitating the thing, then there may be a hell of a lot of pressure to remain that way, regardless of how strongly the kid still feels gender dysphoric. Who knows? That’s a study that hasn’t found its investigator yet.

Even though acceptance and facilitation by parents and teachers of such changes is assumed to be the enlightened and compassionate thing to do for these children, the opposite seems to be true.

Yes, every child dealing with gender dysphoria must be cared for, protected, and treated with dignity. Few if any, are arguing that point. But to use that rationale as a blunt tool to bring every educator and parent in the nation in submission with a wholly subjective and unproven gender ideology is beyond any reason. President Obama is opening a massive Pandora’s Box and the actual size of that box will be evident to all in very short order.

The LGBT Movement Will Not Self Destruct,"I hate to disagree with Rachel Lu, whom I admire and consider a friend. But we simply cannot count on the LGBT movement self-destructing. I agree that this ideology is incoherent and destructive. But that is no guarantee it will implode. I fear Lu does not fully appreciate just what manner of thing we are dealing with.

Lu suggests the LGBT movement is a passing fad: “Whether it’s Malthusian population controls, global temperature freak-outs, low-fat diets, or disco, it often seems that idiocy seems unassailable until suddenly it isn’t. A page turns, and the emperor has no clothes, as his folly becomes a cautionary tale for future generations.”

By contrast, I believe the LGBT movement is one feature of the overall movement called the Sexual Revolution. The Sexual Revolution is not like low-fat diets or disco. It is more like the other items on the list. I hate to break it to you, but population control and global temperature freak-outs are still with us.

Also, what do these three things—the Sexual Revolution, population control, and global warming ideology—all have in common? They are ideologies that demand total control over large numbers of people. These ideologies are appealing to some people, precisely for that reason: they imagine themselves as the controllers, not the controlees.

Internal Contradictions Don’t Always Tank Totalitarianism

The fact that an ideology is incoherent does not mean people are not deadly serious about implementing it. Look: it is not possible to create a prosperous society without private property rights. Marxist ideologues believed they had a high moral duty to try. The Soviet Union lasted 70 years and did not “self-destruct.” Ronald Reagan, Pope John Paul, Margaret Thatcher, and, yes, Osama bin Laden all had a hand in pushing it over.

These three points sum up the ideology of the sexual revolutionaries. They believe a good and decent society should: Separate sex from procreation, separate both sex and procreation from marriage, and obliterate all differences between men and women, except those individuals explicitly choose. Do you recognize our society? Do you notice that all these of these objectives are impossible?

It is not possible to create an entire society in which sex does not make babies. Sex and child-bearing should both take place within marriage because children really do need their parents. Marriage is society’s institutional structure that allows children a stable and ongoing relationship with both parents. Finally, men and women actually are different, starting in the womb (little boys are less likely to survive pregnancy and childhood) and going all the way to differential causes of death.

All the branches of our government, the media, academia, big business, and entertainment are committed to the fantasy ideology of the Sexual Revolution. It takes a lot of force to do the impossible. It takes a lot of propaganda to make people believe the impossible. That is why the Sexual Revolution is a totalitarian movement, standing all on its own, quite apart from the usual categories of Left and Right.

That’s not a bug, as they say. It is a feature. Many of the most militant activists are drunk on their own power. Look at the “trans-activists” getting the city of New York to place onerous fines on people for using the wrong pronoun. Look at the college students, getting professors fired for insufficient conformity to the ever-changing standards of “sensitivity.” Look at the gay activists suing small Christian businesses, as if there were a constitutional right to get your picture taken by the photographer of your choice. These militants are intoxicated with power.

The Sexual Revolution Uses People, Then Discards Them

We must see the Sexual Revolution for what it is: a tyrannical movement that resents the limitations of the human body, especially those caused by our maleness and femaleness.

With all due respect, Lu, the LGBT movement will not self-destruct: it will morph into new and more virulent forms. The LGBT true believers are already throwing over the Ls (lesbians, remember?) in favor of the Ts (transgender people). Lesbian couples made nice, non-threatening images for commercials for redefining marriage. But many lesbians do not accept “transmen” as women. Lesbians are no longer useful as battering rams for taking down sex differences. Therefore, their objections don’t count.

The Ts are the current battering ram. A very useful battering ram they are, too. If you can make people say and believe that Bruce Jenner is a woman, you can make them say and believe anything. If you can make people afraid to say anything other than that the 1976 Olympic decathlon winner is a woman, you can make them believe that black is white, up is down, and freedom is slavery. Or, more to the point: that slavery is freedom.

No, we cannot count on the Sexual Revolution to just fade away. It has caused enormous human suffering already. That has not stopped the true believers from carrying on. The Ruth Institute has a plan. This column is not the place to go into it. Suffice to say, that our plan calls on everyone who has been harmed by the Sexual Revolution to tell the whole truth about what happened to them.

If we all speak up, we have a chance. If we are afraid to speak, if we try to live our lives quietly, as if nothing out of the ordinary is going on, the revolutionaries will continue unimpeded. Eventually, we won’t be able to protect ourselves and our children.

I for one, am all in: total, unapologetic opposition to the whole destructive course of the Sexual Revolution. Total solidarity with the victims and survivors of the Sexual Revolution.

Keep Your Identity Politics Away From Captain America,"Let’s cut to the chase. Captain America is not gay. There’s absolutely nothing in his 70-plus years, multiple heterosexual relationships, and total lack of homosexual relationships that indicates he could in any way be gay. That he hasn’t explicitly stated he’s straight is not an indicator that he could be gay, and asking people to prove that negative doesn’t match Cap’s history. That the Bible doesn’t say Jesus didn’t observe Taco Tuesday isn’t an invitation to assume he did.

Furthermore, Steve Rogers is the red-blooded American archetype. He’s brave, upright, and has a value system that every grandma wishes for her grandsons. He attends church regularly and doesn’t even like cursing. Rogers is a soldier who works in absolutes, and will go so far as to become a criminal to maintain his principles.

Lastly, turning Steve Rogers gay would make him cease being Steve Rogers, because Steve Rogers isn’t gay. His moral compass wouldn’t allow it.

Captain America Fans Aren’t Driving This Discussion

None of this seems to matter to the activists and social justice warriors who latched onto a hashtag to declare that Captain America, the superhero loved and admired by so many, needs to suddenly turn homosexual and get a boyfriend. Together they created the #GiveCaptainAmericaABoyfriend, and without needing much prompting, media outlets from Time to E online to the Los Angeles Times talked about how “fans” wanted Rogers to have a same-sex love interest.

But these aren’t fans of Captain America. Many of them I spoke to on Twitter didn’t even seem to be fans of Marvel. One of them didn’t even know Steve Rogers was the captain’s real name. None of them seemed to be aware that Marvel already had LGBT characters, including the wildly popular Deadpool, who swings in every direction. In short, most of these people weren’t fans, they were armchair activists with a WiFi connection.

If they were really fans of Captain America, then they’d not want to make such a drastic change to his character. Let’s face facts. Rogers is a white, straight male who also happens to be a loyal Christian, and he’s currently at the forefront of Marvel’s most popular team. The horror! To the social justice warrior, this is unacceptable. It’s the current year!

The plan here is to not only take this vestige of the quintessential American from public view, but turn him into something that is more socially acceptable (to some people) and “inclusive.” The thinking here is that if more people were forced to view Cap through the same lens this small minority of LGBT activists views everything, through the lens of identity and sexuality politics, then surely our heteronormative society would give way to a more sexually liberated society where everyone sleeps with everyone, gender doesn’t matter, and dogs and cats live together sans mass hysteria.

Most Americans Aren’t Interested In Sex Politics

The reality is that America is largely not gay: less than 4 percent of the American population makes up that designation. The rest of us aren’t consumed with LGBT concerns, nor do we want to be. It’s not a part of our daily life.

This has nothing to do with “homophobia” or hating gays and lesbians. It has everything to do with the fact that the vast majority of us aren’t gays or lesbians. The hard truth is, LGBT characters and themes don’t play as well on the main stage because most of us don’t fit that category, and we don’t care about the identity politics that comes with characters that focus on it. Gay and lesbian characters whose main characteristic is their sexual orientation offer little potential emotional investment to straight people—not because we hate homosexuals, but because we aren’t like them, and taking our characters and making them unlike us won’t make us accept gay people any more than we already do.

This attempt to force everyone into the LGBT world by pirating one of our most beloved characters and making him struggle with concerns that are relatable to few other people won’t bring us closer together. It will just make us angry that we can no longer relate to our favorite character as we did, and will kill the brand, as well as darken our view of the LGBT community.

Forced ‘Inclusion’ Repels People

The LGBT activist community wants to be included in society but consistently thrusts itself between us and our escapism, then wonders why they feel so isolated when we reject their meddling. Perhaps instead they could connect with people who love comic books through, you know, a shared interest in that world of comic book characters, plots, styling, history, and the like. Pirating Captain America isn’t an act of inclusivity, it’s an offensive measure that pushes his real fans out so people who feel they’re not represented enough can feel better about their “sexual fluidity.”

This is a constant pattern: Activists pushing their will on everyone else by going on the offensive, while simultaneously claiming victimization from a “heteronormative” world at large, then using the resulting outrage over mutations in characters we know and love as proof of how bad they have it in our society. They break these characters into pieces and reassemble them for their own self-confirmation, then tell us it should happen because we need “inclusivity.” Like we owe them important parts of our culture as reparations for everyone else being straight and them having to participate in a straight society.

We don’t. Their inclusivity problem could be easily solved by promoting and spending time and money on the current crop of gay and lesbian characters that seem to be getting the shaft by the community that claims to support them. It’s true that they’ll likely never achieve the fame of Captain America or Iron Man, but we once again have to realize that this concern over identity politics is for a niche audience, and putting Cap in this situation won’t make it any less so.

Even Stan Lee, the man more or less responsible for Marvel’s upbringing, said “I don’t see any reason to change the sexual proclivities of a character once they’ve already been established.”

They Just Want to Use Cap to Score Points

It’s a lazy solution to steal a character away from popular culture and turn him into something he’s not, when you can easily create a new character that has these characteristics established from the get-go. It has the added benefit of alienating no one, and everyone walks away happy. The activists won’t do this, because they don’t want Rogers being who he is in pop culture.

They see good ol’ Captain America as a chance to eliminate one more bastion of normal, everyday America from the public view. He’s one more scalp to put in their trophy case in their quest to legitimize their agenda. They did it with Thor, they did it with Ghostbusters, they tried to do it with video games, and they’re even trying to do it with Jesus. Every popular thing must be approved by the Ministry of Outrage, and if it fails to meet their standards must be overhauled, destroyed, reassembled, repackaged, and force-fed to the public.

Needless to say, we the fans just want to be left with our characters, and if anyone from Marvel reads this, then take my advice. Leave Captain America be. Let our characters be who we love them for. Don’t listen to these fake fans who probably never cared about Captain America before the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Don’t turn every interaction he has with Sam or Bucky into a “Brokeback Mountain” callback. It’s not who he is, and it’s not why we love his character.

Male Love Doesn’t Imply Sexuality

One final point. Social justice warriors falsely insist two men can’t just have a deep bond garnered from childhood friendship—or even more, a bond developed by fighting side-by-side in battle. If you ask soldiers about their fellow brothers in arms, you’ll definitely hear an overtone of love and respect, but the social justice insistence that any affection between men must include homosexuality is rather insulting.

The bond between fellow soldiers is so far out of the experience of the social justice community and the mainstream media that they can only interpret it through a contemporary Hollywood lens. This is such narrow, lazy thinking. Aside from being insulting, it’s boring.

Steve Rogers and his best friend, Bucky Barnes, share such a forged-in-fire relationship. They were not only childhood friends, they fought alongside one another throughout the bloodiest war in history. It’s why Rogers put it all on the line to save Barnes. It has nothing to do with a romantic feeling, and everything to do with that sense of brotherhood and loyalty to a man who bled and lost beside him.

That this should be interpreted as homosexual behavior is a slap in the face to our men and women in arms and others who have experienced the horror of war together. Cap and Bucky’s relationship is a small extension of that, and should be left well alone.

What If Mateen Wasn’t Targeting Gay People At All?,"As Rahm Emanuel famously said, “Never let a serious crisis go to waste.”

In the immediate aftermath of the Orlando nightclub massacre, a narrative quickly emerged among liberal and media elites that “anti-gay” GOP lawmakers, white Christians, and the National Rifle Association were as much to blame for the attack as the shooter, Omar Mateen, and ISIS, which claimed responsibility for the attack.

That would certainly serve the partisan interests of the Left. And if Mateen wasn’t targeting gay people at all, that would really throw a wrench in the works.

Zack Ford got right to the point over at ThinkProgress: “Conservatives Try To Scapegoat Islam To Avoid Responsibility For Perpetuating Anti-LGBT Violence.” A headline at The Daily Beast sputtered, “GOP Homophobes Suddenly Find A Use For Gays.” Glenn Greenwald ranted, “Stop Exploiting LGBT Issues to Demonize Islam and Justify Anti-Muslim Policies.”

CNN’s Sally Kohn wasted no time comparing right-wing Christians to radical Muslims, tweeting, “Hey right wing Christians desperately trying to point out that right wing Muslims are more anti-gay than you are: Your guilt is showing!” And: “Last I checked, it’s not Muslim religious extremists shooting up abortion clinics and killing abortion doctors.”

“Here’s what the Christian right’s got to wrestle with: They’re only a few points behind the Orlando shooter on the same political spectrum,” tweeted Sarah Jones of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.

More abstractly, “toxic masculinity” was also to blame. “Overcompensation Nation: It’s time to admit that toxic masculinity drives gun violence,” declared a headline at Salon. Another at ThinkProgress announced “The Role Of Toxic Masculinity In Mass Shootings.”

It wasn’t just the fault of Christians and masculinity. Guns and gun rights groups were also to blame. Hollywood luminaries Seth MacFarlane and Susan Sarandon, showing how little they know about firearms, incoherently called for a ban on “automatic weapons.” Even The New York Times’ Roger Cohen got in on the action, musing that “Mateen demonstrated again just how potent the mix of ISIS and National Rifle Association ideology is.”

Mateen Said Nothing About Punishing Gay People

But what if Mateen didn’t specifically target a gay nightclub? What if the choice of the club and the victims were incidental to the killer’s intent? What if Mateen simply hated America, loved ISIS, considered himself an Islamist, and wanted to kill as many infidels as possible?

Why else would Mateen have scouted out other locations like Walt Disney World? Could it be that this, too, is a place where large numbers of people gather and where Mateen could have launched a surprise attack against unsuspecting civilians? Mateen’s wife, Noor Sahi Salman, reportedly told People that recently he had been “scouting Downtown Disney and Pulse [nightclub] for attacks.” Downtown Disney, reports People, doesn’t have a security and bag check at the entrance, unlike the other four Disney World theme parks.

If Mateen’s specific purpose had been to target not just Americans, but gay Americans, why did he never mention this in his 911 call? According to multiple law enforcement sources, Mateen called 911 about 30 minutes after launching his attack and pledged allegiance to ISIS and its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

But that’s not all he said. Mateen claimed he was doing this in solidarity with Boston marathon bombers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, and Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, the first U.S. citizen to carry out a suicide attack in Syria. He also said he was protesting “the U.S. bombing in Syria and Iraq and the killing of women and children.”

No mention of carrying out an Islamic punishment for homosexuality, no mention of gay or lesbian Americans, no mention of his victims at all. Of course, it’s no secret that Islam condemns homosexuality, and that ISIS has executed gay men by throwing them from rooftops in Mosul. So it’s possible that Mateen decided to attack Pulse, a well-known gay nightclub, to carry out a punishment he believed Islam demands for homosexuality.

But in light of the going media narrative, that Mateen specifically targeted a gay nightclub because of his hatred of homosexuality, it seems a rather significant omission on his part. It would also undermine a plot that the Left and the mainstream media want desperately to advance. If the Orlando massacre turns out to be just another terrorist attack by a radical Muslim who hates the West and loves ISIS, what use would it be as a domestic political weapon?

Why The Left Has Not Won The Culture War,"There have been many declarations lately that the game has been called on the culture war and the Left won. (Here and here are two thoughtful examples.) It wasn’t long ago key leaders in the evangelical community were insisting definitively that the battle for the culture will be forever won or lost in the next few years.

Both are wrong. The truth is the culture war, by its very nature, cannot be won or lost. Culture is inherently dialectic. The buzzer never sounds. The rotund lady never rises to sing. When the clock does indeed run out at the eschaton, it will be evident and none of us will be calling the game for any side. But until then, the state of the so-called culture war is a measure of yards gained and lost on varied fields at a given moment in time. It ebbs and flows at various levels, in constant motion this way and that, and has been doing so ever since cultural morals and practices were first argued about in the original human community. That’s what culture is.

Consider Same-Sex Marriage

Given this, various quarters are often winning and losing at the same time, sometimes simultaneously experiencing both on a single issue. Let’s look at two recent white-hot examples of this.

Did religious conservatives lose at Obergefell? Indeed. We also lost at Roe v. Wade. The game over same-sex marriage is no more over than it was at Roe. Such things are not static. Since 1973, there has been a vibrant, growing, and very influential pro-life movement in every major community around the country giving witness to the value of all life.

Planned Parenthood had been rocked on its heels requiring they play defense long before this year’s infamous undercover videos revealing it is deep in the baby-parts trade. Abortion clinics continue to close at dramatic rates, and restrictions on abortions have been gaining favor and legal passage. The trend lines on who identifies as “pro-life” and “pro-choice” over the last ten years demonstrate this dialectic dramatically as they cross each other with regular frequency and pro-life identity increasing wholesale since 1995.

The same-sex family experiment—just like the abortion-on-demand experiment—has clearly won itself a dominant place on the field. It will, however, have to demonstrate its worth and longevity in the lives of the couples, the children they obtain, and their family’s impact on their communities. Only the experience that can be gained through time will determine whether this marriage redefinition retains its public support and winning position. Dramatic overreaches such as the unabashed bulldozing of individual religious liberty rights and the right to dissent as well as the LGBT advocacy’s hair-trigger use of “Jim Crow” will quickly displace this issue’s new car smell.

This is already happening on the bathroom issue in no small way. Beyond general public outrage from armies of momma bears, even in generally liberal communities, the New York Times and New Yorker have printed surprising substantial critiques by Yale and Harvard Law School professors of the president’s mandate that all public schools no longer segregate their restrooms and locker room showers by sex. The LGBT is winning and losing at the same time.

Take a Look at Feminism

Consider a longer historical look at the culture war. Does radical feminism have the influence it did 30 years ago? Hardly. Sheryl Sandberg’s moderate “Lean In” is certainly not Betty Friedan’s torching “Feminine Mystique.” Many of Friedan’s readers raised highly educated, skilled daughters with nearly unlimited professional opportunities, but many of them are choosing to put bulk of their weekly energy into motherhood over careers. Those who are not yet mothers deeply desire to be.

Looking even further back, the twentieth century was to have concluded with the absolute extermination of that vile opiate of the masses. Science, naturalism, and logical positivism were to have cleansed us of our reliance on all religious superstitions, or perhaps just Christianity. Many believers, then as today, accept this as the case. But Rodney Stark demonstrates in “The Triumph of Faith” that the world is not merely as religious as it ever has been, but “in important ways, it is much more intensely religious than ever before; indeed, it is far more churched.”

So it is. For as long as citizens hold passionate public convictions and the voice to communicate them, the culture war will always remain in play, marked by evolving setbacks and advances by all sides on numerous issues and often at the very same time.

This dialectic never consists of just two sides—“us versus them.” There are significant, ever-shifting, and competing sub-factions at play. That is the very nature and complexity of culture, precisely what makes it so curious and difficult to predict.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/06/14/why-the-left-has-not-won-the-culture-war/,2016-06-14
The Rise Of Cultural Parasites,"“The brown-headed cowbird is an obligate brood parasite.” That’s the one thing I remember from “The Biology of Birds,” a class I selected to meet my undergraduate science requirement because it sounded easy and didn’t have a lab or require group work.

For those of you who may have been too busy taking actual science courses to learn what that phrase means, obligate brood parasites are the kind of birds that, because they can’t build nests of their own, lay their eggs in nests other birds have built, birds whose offspring are generally smaller and take longer to incubate. The parasitic bird hatches first, causing the host mother to cease incubating her actual offspring to tend to the imposter. Other times, the parasitic mother will destroy the host eggs after she lays her own, ending any competition from the get-go. Either way, the result is the same: an organism that can’t create something itself coopts another organism’s creation to further its own survival.

Culturally speaking, I worry that my generation of westerners has become a collection of obligate brood parasites. Like every generation before us, we want to see our values survive. Like our ancestors, we want to influence the world and leave our imprint on society. But unlike those earlier generations, we seem to have lost the ability to accomplish those goals by creating, building, inventing, and imagining. Rather, to better the world as we see fit, we employ the far more parasitic approach of seizing the nest someone else built and refashioning it to our liking.

Listen to the Internet cowbirds crowing for the nest builders to give them what they desire instead of just producing it themselves. Feminists in the James Bond nest are insisting that they be given a female 007 while those who have infested the Ghostbusters nest scream “Misogynists!” and push the host hatchlings out of the tree the second they complain that the all-lady reboot with lazy jokes and “Scooby Doo: Monsters Unleashed”-looking ghosts sullies the beloved film of their youth.

Likewise, among LGBT advocates who want to see media for adolescents and children manifest acceptance of gay characters, we see something similar. Recently, some Twitter users plopped into Disney’s nest and demanded that the creators of “Frozen’s” first non-romantically entangled princess be given a girlfriend, while others parachuted into the Marvel nest and demanded that Captain America be liberated from his shackles of heteronormativity and be given a boyfriend.

Leftism Doesn’t Build Things

On the surface, all of this is rather confusing. After all, until recently, if an Indian musician thought the works of Mozart didn’t reflect his culture, he didn’t start a “Give the Symphony a Sitar” hashtag campaign. Rather, he created his own compositions so that those who shared his culture, experiences, tastes, and values wouldn’t be left out. So if feminists want a super spy or a fighter of phantasmal forces to call their own, why don’t they, via novels or film or television or comics, create them instead of coopting Bond and the Ghostbusters? Likewise, if LGBT advocates believe the world will be better off with more lesbian princesses and out-and-proud superheroes, why don’t they produce this material themselves?

The answer, I think, is fairly simple. During the feminist and civil rights movements, leftism (however vaguely that may be defined) didn’t build things. It changed things built by someone else. America, it perceived, had great potential, but was hamstrung by the bigotry and moral failings of its founders, bigotry and moral failings passed down to those currently controlling the governmental, societal, and cultural strings.

Leftists took control of those strings and, at least in their minds, succeeded at bettering everyone, and those who came of age in subsequent decades essentially came to believe that the most virtuous way to stamp out bigotry and discrimination was not to build something new but to overtake pre-existing institutions and fix what the builders did wrong. Quite simply, my generation doesn’t know how to create because we never bothered learning how, being taught from the cradle that honing our parasitic skills was a better use of our time.

This is why the average young adult who needs GPS to find anything beyond three blocks around his apartment can’t make it through Columbus Day without proclaiming his moral superiority over the Italian explorer—because, in his mind, embracing diversity and checking his white privilege on American soil is a greater accomplishment than discovering American soil. It’s also why your average high school student who can’t write a thesis statement feels not an ounce of inferiority when comparing herself to Thomas Jefferson. After all, writing the Declaration of Independence is a fine accomplishment, but it’s nothing compared to picking the racist twigs out of the Founding Fathers’ nest by shouting “slave rapist” every time his name is invoked.

It’s also why my generation feels such overwhelming compulsion to “fix” the misogynistic or heteronormative stories someone else has already told and pat ourselves on the back for our bravery. Why bother learning that forgotten skillset of creating when it’s inherently less virtuous than overtaking someone else’s imperfect nest? Exorcising young girls of the Aykroydian and Flemingian implications that women have no business busting ghosts or super-spying is a greater accomplishment than actually inventing the Ghostbusters or Bond, so quit whining about the girl versions not being funny or interesting when building a humorous or entertaining nest is of less value than cleansing those nests of their misogynistic impurities.

Likewise, when my generation has become convinced that a host’s privilege points only serve to weaken its defenses, why break a sweat learning to create your own worlds when it should be a piece of cake to take the franchises built by straight, white males? Why spend all that time making an original queer princess story, only for it to be relegated to Netflix’s mostly ignored “Gay and Lesbian” section, when you can get Disney to hand you the reins to the “Frozen” empire by threatening them with accusations of bigotry? Why do the hard work of creating an audience-enticing, super out-and-proud superhero, when you can just seize the one audiences have already embraced from the over-privileged nest builders who surely don’t have the strength to fend you off?

Christians Aren’t Off the Hook

Granted, the liberal social justice warriors were not the only ones to inherit the “take, don’t make” mentality. For the past several decades, conservative Christians adopted the parasitic approach, convincing themselves that overtaking secular nests and repurposing them in a “Christian” style was somehow more virtuous than actually making something new.

Having embraced the same mindset as many secular counterparts, Christian parents convinced themselves that creating their own unique faith-driven stories or storytelling genres, like Dante and Milton and Bunyan and Wallace and Lewis and Tolkien had done, would have been too much work and required capital and capabilities they didn’t have, so they churchified the Saturday morning cartoon nest by showing their kids videos of a talking cucumber lecturing them about honesty and fairness with a Bible verse or two thrown in at the end. They swapped out Batman episodes with the adventures of Bibleman and praised themselves for their faithfulness. They put the “Facing the Giants” DVD in the “Remember the Titans” case. They justified all of this thinking rebuilding secular nests with Christian garbage was best for their children.

Likewise, with regard to music, furthering the tradition of legendary Christian hymnists and composers like Paul Gerhardt and Johann Sebastian Bach would have required a skillset these modern Christians were neither taught nor willing to learn, and finding their own voice would have proven just as difficult.

But three chords and pop song structure were pretty easy to imitate, so when they saw their children listening to music that glorified premarital sex and drug use, they parasitically strapped on guitars, infested the pre-existing nest of secular music, and produced awful Christian rockers, embarrassing Christian rappers, and an endless array of Top-40-sounding Christian artists ranging from bad Belinda Carlisle knockoffs to somehow-worse-than-actual-Richard-Marx Richard Marx knockoffs.

The results, however, were disastrous—not just because, in seeking to make Christianity better, they only made rock and roll worse, but also because they rendered us, their children, incapable of knowing any better. Because they settled for secular copycats, they never exposed us to Christendom’s great music, literature, artwork, and architecture. Because of this, we’ve become a bunch of musically illiterate, artistically impoverished believers with no appreciation for beauty who are perfectly content to spend Sunday mornings singing terrible music in repurposed movie theaters or gymnasiums, aspiring to nothing more because it’s never even occurred to us that the Christian faith gives us the power to form culture instead of parodying it.

By trying to safely place us into those pre-built but repurposed nests, our parents only succeeded in obligating us to the parasitic tradition. We’re already passing down that tradition to our offspring, and until we learn to stop believing the lie that taking is greater than making, I fear we’ll never recover the ability to create.

Making Is Stronger than Taking

So as one who has, in his own terrain, seen the culturally destructive effects of the brown-headed cowbird approach, I beg those to my Left to reconsider their methods for affecting change. If you’re a feminist, infesting the Ghostbusters or James Bond nest won’t teach your daughters to be bold and assertive. It will just teach them to be lazy, thinking they’ve accomplished something greater than the Cub Scouts by sloppily painting “girl power” on a treehouse built by the boys.

Perhaps it’s time to see that everyone benefits when nobody stoops to swiping each other’s nests.

Likewise, if you’re of the opinion that gay characters aren’t already overrepresented in media, you’re not going to better the state gay people by shoving the straightness out of Queen Elsa or Captain America’s nests. All you’ll accomplish is stripping the next generation of the ability to create its own characters, tell its own stories, and leave its own mark.

Granted, much of the cultural change that modern feminists and LGBT activists are trying to bring about is not change that I want to see happen, just as I’d imagine that many of the things I’d like to accomplish are unappealing to them. But in a world where people tend to imitate the tactics of those on the other side of the cultural wars, perhaps it’s time to see that everyone benefits when nobody stoops to swiping each other’s nests.

Perhaps it’s time for Christians to let moralizing cartoon characters stay secular and for feminists to let Ghostbusters remain men of the 1980s, while all of us work on rediscovering the lost art of creating our own stories, making our own art, building our own beautiful things, and trusting that the world will notice and history will remember the makers far better than the takers.

Why It’s Idiotic To Blame Christians For The Orlando Attack,"The media constantly refuses to air critiques of both Islam and the LGBT lobby, and I was curious what the coverage would look like when the two cultures finally clashed. But I had expected we’d see a gay couple attempting to purchase a wedding cake from a Muslim baker or hire a Muslim wedding photographer, and wondered whether the courts and public opinion would rule the same way they had against Christians. Yet there are no words for the horror that occurred in Orlando. My heart aches for everyone who suffered loss that day.

I do want to look at a common response from some on the Left, however. Employees of the American Civil Liberties Union and others promptly blamed Christians for the shooting, which is idiotic.

The Christian Right has introduced 200 anti-LGBT bills in the last six months and people blaming Islam for this. No. #PulseNightclub

So many terroristic enablers in churches, in Congress, and state houses. Whether by discriminatory policy or the love affair with guns.



— Mandela Barnes (@TheOtherMandela) June 12, 2016

It’s bigoted and ignorant enough to blame an entire demographic for the actions of one person from that demographic (“All Muslims are terrorists,” for example), but why on earth would you blame an entirely different demographic? When someone says, “I do this horrific thing in the name of Religion A,” it’s irrational to blame Religion B.

We Love Gay People, So We Won’t Lie to Them

The shooting happened at a gay bar, and Christians do believe that marriage is the permanent and exclusive unity of one man and one woman, for reasons that were obvious to most people until a few decades ago. Being a lot more stable than the whims of society, Christianity still teaches the same things about marriage.

Christians believe the laws of morality are as objective as the laws of physics: we didn’t make them, but we can learn them. Just as we can build better airplanes if we understand the laws of physics, we can build better societies if we understand the laws of morality. Sin is real, and Christianity’s founding moment was God, out of love, dealing with that.

But while Christians believe homosexual actions are wrong, Christianity has never and does not now teach that it’s okay to kill people just because they’re gay. When fringe groups calling themselves Christian do horrific things, Christians are nearly unanimous in denouncing them and pointing out how these actions aren’t Christian at all. (For example, watch LutheranSatire’s delightful mockery of the Westboro Baptist Church as the Westboro Baptist Chipmunks.) We believe that sin is real, but the context within which we believe that does not inspire violence.

For one thing, we believe we’re pretty much all in the same boat regarding sin. We’re all sinners, whether we spend our Saturday nights at gay bars or in church. Jesus made it clear that he came for sinners. (If you want to hear him being explicit, read Mark 2:17, where he says, “Those who are well do not need a physician, but the sick do. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repent.”)

Yes, Christians do believe homosexual actions are sinful. But we also believe that mass shootings are sinful, and lying is sinful, and gossip is sinful, and so are laziness, torture, theft, rape, dishonesty, abuse. As a Catholic, I go to confession about once a month to repent, seek mercy, and renew my own commitment to rid myself of sinful behavior. We all sin.

In the face of horrific sins like the shooting in Orlando, Christians often remind themselves, “But for the grace of God, there go I.” This is distinctly different both from the brand of Islam that the Orlando shooter proclaimed his allegiance to and from the secular attack mobs on Twitter insisting on lashing out at their political opponents rather than doing some soul-searching or seeking to comfort the stricken families during a time of grief.

Sin Is Not the End of the Road, But a Beginning

When Christians say “that action is sinful,” we don’t presume to judge a person’s culpability from a place of superiority. We didn’t make the rules. We break them ourselves, plenty. So we leave the judging and punishing to God. Our faith teaches that the reality of our sin doesn’t have to define us for eternity. It’s a faith of hope, of an opportunity for all our sins to be wiped clean for eternity. When the Jews of Jesus’s time were poised to stone a woman caught in adultery, he raised the bar for their moral understanding. “Let the one among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her,” he said. Then he told the woman, “From now on, do not sin anymore.”

He didn’t say it’s okay to betray your spouse, or that the woman didn’t sin. But he got everyone to examine their own consciences, drop their rocks, and leave. This is the man Christians follow. (For further illustration, see his Parable of the Unforgiving Servant.) We believe in sin, but we’re taught to respond not with hate but with love, as many Chick-Fil-A employees did in Orlando, following the example of Christ. This is a complex belief well-suited to the human condition that many on the secular Left seem unwilling to understand or grapple with seriously. They prefer instead to set up caricatures of Christianity and attack those.

While Christians believe in sin, we also believe in repentance and mercy. The great promise of Christianity is that, ultimately, our sins don’t have to condemn us to death. When St. John the Baptist was preparing the way for Jesus—the transcendent God becoming a human being who would suffer horrific violence to provide a way out of the world we’ve made horrific—he didn’t slaughter the people he judged to be sinful. He called them to repentance. That’s been the message of Christianity from the beginning: we’re all sinners, but there’s hope because of God’s exemplary love; we need to repent.

To say that Christianity’s teaching about marriage caused the shooting at a gay bar is to reveal either profound ignorance or profound disregard for accuracy, either of which ought to be profoundly embarrassing. It also reveals a profound hypocrisy among those who are willing to criticize one world religion reflexively while shielding another that has actual ties to the event in question.

When ISIS routinely throws gay people off buildings and publicly calls for terrorist attacks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and a shooter calls 911 during the attack to pledge allegiance to ISIS, and ISIS claims responsibility for the attack, you have limited options. You can be ignorant and bigoted, and blame all Muslims, or all Middle Easterners, or all people who have darkish skin and beards. You can be irrational and idiotic, and blame a different religion entirely. Or you can acknowledge the obvious fact that the gunman was inspired by the violent faction of Islam that is ISIS.

You pick.

"Aziz Ansari Should Protest Sharia, Not Donald Trump","Aziz Ansari is an actor and comedian famous for his character on the TV show “Parks and Recreation,” among other productions. His parents are Muslim immigrants from India. He recently wrote an editorial in The New York Times blasting Donald Trump, calling the candidate “hate-filled,” “xenophobic,” and that he makes Ansari scared for his (Muslim) family. Below is my response.

Dear Aziz,

“Parks and Recreation” is one of my favorite TV shows and your character, Tom Haverford, is hilarious. I love going back and watching reruns. As such it is an honor to write to you.

I read your New York Times op-ed on Donald Trump, in which you blasted him for being bigoted. In response, I have a few questions for you.

You are pro-LGBT. However, most majority-Muslim communities around the world have a very poor track record on LGBT treatment. In fact, in 10 majority-Muslim countries, homosexuality is punishable by death. Trump, however, supports LGBT causes. Have you written letters to Muslim scholars, Muslim newspapers in your parents’ home of Tamil Nadu, India, or other places, holding them accountable for being anti-LGBT the same way you wrote your letter to the Times against Trump?

Aziz, you are a supporter of feminism. Yet I’m sure you’re aware that majority-Muslim countries have an abysmal track record on women’s rights, whether the issue is female genital mutilation, forced marriage, legally sanctioned domestic violence, honor killings, denial of education for women and girls, or many, many other expressions of their human dignity. Are you fighting against the oppression of women in the Muslim world with the same focus and urgency that you are against Trump?

You say you are not a religious person, unlike your parents, who are Muslim. Yet I’m sure you know that in many majority-Muslim areas, there is no freedom of religion such as the kind you enjoy in the United States, and most people in those places cannot freely leave Islam, as you are able to do. In fact, in Saudi Arabia, atheism has been branded by the government as terrorism and is subject to prosecution, and conversion from Islam is punishable by death. Have you written letters to popular newspapers and media in Saudi Arabia or other majority-Muslim countries demanding they embrace freedom of religion—including the freedom to leave Islam—the same way you wrote your letter to the Times against Trump?

You’ve suggested in your comedy sketches that you believe religion should stay out of government. Thankfully, the United States enjoys the separation of church and state that you prefer. However, Islam contains the principle of Sharia law, which says Muslims should embrace Islamic government as laid out in the Quran. In fact, most majority-Muslim countries adopt at least some form of Sharia law.

Trump, by contrast—not being an evangelical—is (probably) pro-choice on abortion and pro-LGBT, similar to yourself. So my question is, have you written letters to the newspapers and leaders in Muslim communities arguing for the kind of separation of church and state that we enjoy in the United States, the same way you wrote to the Times rebuking Trump?

Aziz, thinking about all these points and about your progressive worldview, it seems clear to me that Islam conflicts with your values as an American much more than Donald Trump’s values do. Perhaps your attack had the wrong target?

Another Study Finds Same-Sex Parents Aren't Best For Kids,"Does a child need a mother and a father? A new study says they do, confirming what we already knew through human experience and common sense yet is being increasingly denied by people who insist on putting adult desires above the rights of children.

The study by sociology professor Paul Sullins found that “[a]t age 28, the adults raised by same-sex parents were at over twice the risk of depression as persons raised by man-woman parents.” In addition, there was an “elevated risk associated with imbalanced closeness and parental child abuse in family of origin; depression, suicidality, and anxiety at age 15; and stigma and obesity.”

Given these findings, Sullins concluded that “[m]ore research and policy attention to potentially problematic conditions for children with same-sex parents appears warranted.” This study is significant, Sullins writes, because other studies that have “reported ‘no differences’ in well-being” most often use “psychometric measures of depression or anxiety,” which has led to “a lapse in policy attention to the potential needs of such children.” Sullins’ research challenges the “benign findings” of these other studies.

“Reanalyses have confirmed, not surprisingly, the presence in such samples of strong ascertainment bias, social desirability bias, and/or positive reporting bias” in studies that have concluded there are no differences between children of same-sex couples and those of opposite-sex parents.

Higher Reports of Depression and Abuse

Sullins’ study, while small, “followed a representative sample of American adolescents through interviews at average age 15 (Wave I, baseline) in 1995, age 22 in 2002 (Wave III), and age 28 in 2008 (Wave IV, terminus).” His research found that during adolescence, the children of same-sex parents reported less depression than the children of opposite-sex parents. But by the time the children were between ages 24 and 32, that reversed dramatically. More than half of the children of same-sex parents reported depression while depression among children of opposite-sex parents declined to under 20 percent.

Children of same-sex parents also reported more violence, having a parent slap, hit, or kick them, or saying “things that hurt your feelings or made you feel you were not wanted or loved,” or “touched you in a sexual way, forced you to touch him or her in a sexual way, or forced you to have sex relations.” In conclusion:

The emergence of higher depression risk in early adulthood, coupled with a more frequent history of abuse victimization, parental distance, and obesity, suggests that the inattention of research and policy to the problems of children with same-sex parents is unwarranted.



As initial results, the present findings should be interpreted with caution and balance, based on the limited evidence presented, and (it is hoped) neither exaggerated nor dismissed out of hand on preconceived ideological grounds. However, well-intentioned concern for revealing negative information about a stigmatized minority does not justify leaving children without support in an environment that may be problematic or dangerous for their dignity and security.

Sullins’ study is not alone in suggesting more research needs to be done in this area. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services published an extensive study proving the importance of biological fathers in the “healthy development of children.” In addition, “the most careful, rigorous, and methodologically sound study ever conducted” on the issue of homosexual parenting found “numerous and significant differences” between children raised by biological parents and children of homosexuals, “with the outcomes for children of homosexuals rated ‘suboptimal’ in almost every category.”

Yet, advocates of same-sex parenting in which babies are born with the intended purpose of leaving at least one biological parent out of the child’s life—either through surrogacy or sperm donation—maintain kids don’t need their biological mother or father.

Deliberately Denying a Child His Biological Parents Is Wrong

I can’t emphasize this point enough—the intentionality of it. We’re not talking about accidental births or loss. We are talking about adults premeditatedly deciding to bring a child into this world who will be deliberately denied knowing or having a relationship with his mother or father.

Advocates of this deviance from established norms cite their own studies claiming the children will be all right, and reject out of hand more extensive studies that prove otherwise, ignoring grown children who testify that being purposely denied a relationship with their parents is a deep psychological and emotional wound that will never fully heal.

They also ignore the social and political impact. When two men or two women (or singles, for that matter) who are raising a child from surrogacy or sperm donation angrily and indignantly claim that a biological mother or father isn’t necessary, I’m reminded of Aldous Huxley’s “Brave New World” where “parent” is a taboo word, and “to say one was a mother—that was past a joke: it was an obscenity.”

Huxley’s world is a dystopian society in which the state has dehumanized people in order to control them. By using (or misusing) technology for reproduction, authorities in this society create people separate from family units, changing the basis of their identity and conditioning them through sex and drugs.

We aren’t to this extreme point, of course. But Huxley’s philosophical novel is prescient in many respects as the march toward greater control by the state is well underway, with social norms and even laws being changed to make our identity fluid and malleable—and thus vulnerable to manipulation. Advocating same-sex parenting in which children are purposely (not accidentally through death or some tragedy) denied a relationship with a biological parent is part of this.

I Need to Know My Origins

Essential to our identity as human beings—as individuals—is knowledge of who we are and where we come from. One of the most basic questions we ask as humans is “Who am I?” The most fundamental answer to that question involves knowing our parents, our heritage, our ancestry, and our origins (which leads to questions of a Creator).

We don’t come into this world as isolated individuals disconnected from a community. We are not like the people in “Brave New World,” raised in test tubes and subject to the whim of the powerful as they control and manipulate us. We are born to one man and one woman— into a particular family—and that family gives us identity, meaning, and safety. To take us out of that context and place us in another that is simply a parody of a real family is to separate us from parts of ourselves, hence dehumanizing and setting us adrift on the isolating currents of nihilism.

Every person has the need and fundamental right to self-knowledge. If we’re denied this self-knowledge, then we have only “other-knowledge,” and this leads to loss of self-determination—it is a kind of bondage, as we are defined by others.

This is why it is so disturbing to hear same-sex couples talk flippantly and even proudly of raising children without knowledge of at least one real, biological parent—as if that parent bears no importance in that child’s life. But nothing can be further from the truth.

Children need their mothers—their real mothers. Children need their fathers—their real fathers. In the context of familial bonds, a child develops into a healthy, independent, and free-thinking adult who has self-knowledge rooted in nature, not contrived social constructs.

We Didn’t Need Data to Know This Truth

I’ve already cited studies that confirm this and referenced testimonies that support it, but, ultimately, this isn’t a debate about data. Those who are determined to separate children from their parents and call it “good” don’t want to consider the data anyway (or they only want to look at favorable—and often biased—data). My argument, therefore, is an appeal to common sense, reason, and human experience throughout the course of history.

Literature tells the human narrative of what it means to know ourselves and how knowing our parents plays an integral role in that self-knowledge.

What is more plain to right-thinking people than the fact that a child, who is created by two people and genetically part of both, needs to have a relationship with those two people to develop in a healthy way? What is more fundamental to our existence than to know where we came from and who we are?

Literature itself—a witness of human experience—describes repeatedly the longing in a child’s heart to know his or her parent. From “Peter Pan” to “Harry Potter”; from “Sarah, Plain and Tall,” where little Caleb longs to know the smallest details about his mother, to “The Secret Life of Bees,” which is about Lily’s journey to discover herself as she learns about her dead mother, literature tells the human narrative of what it means to know ourselves and how knowing our parents plays an integral role in that self-knowledge.

The images of these stories is heartbreaking: Harry, sitting before the Mirror of Erised where he sees his family smiling at him, “There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all.” Or little Caleb in “Sarah, Plain and Tall” asking his big sister, “Did Mama sing every day? Every-single-day?” Yes, “Every-single-day,” she told him. The child longed to know his mother, to feel her warmth, to hear what she thought of him.

Even more touching is Lily’s quest to know her mother in “The Secret Life of Bees”:

The worst thing was lying there wanting my mother. That’s how it had always been; my longing for her nearly always came late at night when my guard was down. I tossed on the sheets, wishing I could crawl into bed with her and smell her skin. I wondered: Had she worn thin nylon gowns to bed? Did she bobby-pin her hair? I could just see her, propped in bed. My mouth twisted as I pictured myself climbing in beside her and putting my head against her breast. I would put it right over her beating heart and listen. Mama, I would say. And she would look down at me and say, Baby, I’m right here.

Some might think anyone can step in and fill that role. They can’t. Not fully. That doesn’t mean loving substitutes can’t do a lot of good as they give much to a child (especially when children are adopted because of tragic circumstances), but there is nothing like being connected to your real mother—to the woman who helped form your identity, to whom you are existentially bound on a physical and even spiritual level.

‘Her Love Left Me Unhappy and Incomplete’

As I read through the testimonies of children who have been purposely denied a parent, I’m haunted by their words. One story in particular shows the pain a child of same-sex parents goes through as she wrestles with the inner desire to know her father and siblings. In our society today, these children aren’t free to express themselves, and they’re made to feel guilty for “betraying” their socially constructed mothers.

But what is more important here? The feelings and desires of adults, or the real and natural needs of a child who has been deprived of something essential to her well-being?

“How do you talk to your mom about how hurt you are when her effort, drive, and passion to have you brought into this world is the reason you can even speak?” one donor child asks. “How do you sit someone down and essentially tell them that they are not enough of a ‘family’ for you?”

‘It’ll crush her,’ I say — because having to grasp the fact that her unconditional love left me unhappy and incomplete will be devastating.



This is the moment I feel my entire body tense up as they utter the all too familiar and famous words: ‘You should be grateful that she wanted you here so badly that she went through this whole process and literally payed to ensure she could love a child.’



Right then and there I question my entire thought process. Is it unethical or immoral for me to want to know where half of me comes from?

The writer is quick to say she is grateful to be put on this earth, “but I go to sleep every night and wake up every morning feeling lost.”

I will never know what it is like to play catch with a father at age 6. I will never know what it is like to bring a boy home, only to have a dad threaten them. I will never know what it is like to wake up on Father’s Day morning to anything other than my mom saying we should send a photo to the family to celebrate — only to have me say ‘there is no father to send this photo to.’ I will never know what it is like to make eye contact with the man that is responsible for my existence. All I am left with is my unique olive complexion and my small nose. Those are the bits and pieces I can make out to be the pieces of me that have come from him, and while small or dumb, it all means the world.

This girl isn’t asking for anything other than to know where she came from and be connected to the other person who is responsible for her existence. This is an organic, fundamental need, and it has been purposely and intentionally denied. She didn’t lose a father to an accident. He didn’t abandon her. She was kept from him because of her mother’s own selfish reasons that have been glossed over as noble.

Ironically, family law forbids this kind of treatment of children. If a divorced woman tries to take a child and keep him from his father, then she has violated civil codes and will be held accountable. This is because our society recognizes it is in the best interest of a child to have both parents in his life. Our society also recognizes that it is the responsibility of both parents to raise that child (practically and financially).

This Is a Double Standard

But somehow, that value of “the best interest of the child” goes out the window when it comes to same-sex parenting (or any parenting from sperm donors and surrogacy). At that point, it’s okay to deny a child the other parent, to purposely raise him without a father or a mother.

We turn a blind eye to this treatment of children because we value LGBT ‘rights’ over a child’s rights.

Suddenly, we decide a child actually doesn’t need his father and mother in his life. All that matters in same-sex parenting is the desires and needs of the adults. They determine what the family looks like. They determine the child’s identity. They determine what the child needs and doesn’t need. It’s all about the adult without a thought to the real needs of the child.

By definition in many states, such intentional treatment of a child classifies as emotional abuse, a form of child neglect. According to childwelfare.gov, emotional abuse/child neglect is “injury to the psychological capacity or emotional stability of the child as evidenced by an observable or substantial change in behavior, emotional response, or cognition” and injury as evidenced by “anxiety, depression, withdrawal, or aggressive behavior.”

Many children of same-sex parents who have been purposely denied knowing their parent have suffered from depression and anxiety, a point made prior to Sullins’ study in a study published in Social Science Research. Those researchers also found that children of homosexual parents “are more likely to suffer from depression,” “report less safety and security in their family of origin,” and “are an astonishing 10 times more likely to have been ‘touched sexually by a parent or other adult caregiver.’”

Yet no one seems to care. We turn a blind eye to this treatment of children because we value LGBT “rights” over a child’s rights. As a society, we can do better. We need to stop normalizing the abnormal and stop calling what is bad good.

If we don’t, we are at risk of not only hurting individuals—children who deserve so much better—but ushering in a “Brave New World” where “everyone belongs to everyone else,” because we are subject to the desires of others instead of being free to know and be our true selves—starting with knowing our true parents.

"Iowa Forces Trans Bathrooms On Churches, Forbids Preaching","Iowa churches and church-run daycares must let males and females pee, dress, and shower next to each other, and pastors and Christians could be brought before extrajudicial tribunals if they “directly or indirectly” make “persons of any particular…gender identity” feel “unwelcome,” according to new regulations from Iowa’s Orwellian-named “Civil Rights Commission.”

The commission’s new regulatory guidelines pertaining to a 2007 state “sexual orientation and gender identity,” or SOGI, law also require private businesses, schools, libraries, police departments, and any private organizations that receive government funds to let men and women shower, change clothes, urinate, and defecate inside whichever formerly sex-protected facilities they choose. No sex-change or birth-certificate is necessary for biological males, for example, to gain access to formerly women-only private facilities, the commission says. Declaring oneself a certain sex is all that’s needed.

On behalf of Fort Des Moines Church of Christ, Alliance Defending Freedom attorneys filed suit against the regulatory guidelines in federal court Monday, stating in a press release:

The speech ban could be used to gag churches from making any public comments—including from the pulpit—that could be viewed as unwelcome to persons who do not identify with their biological sex. This is because the commission says the law applies to churches during any activity that the commission deems to not have a ‘bona fide religious purpose.’ Examples the commission gave are ‘a child care facility operated at a church or a church service open to the public,’ which encompasses most events that churches hold.

The guidelines state: “if [a business or organization] offers some services, facilities, or goods to the general public, it will be treated as a public accommodation” — e.g., forced to de-sex its personal hygiene facilities. Also implied is the application of these rules to K-12 schools, public and private universities, homeschool classes, Bible studies, potlucks, bake sales, vacation Bible schools, and so forth.

Forbidden behaviors include “Harassment, intimidation, or other demonstration of hostility,” which the commission defines as “verbal, physical, or written conduct,” “repeated remarks of a demeaning nature,” “demeaning jokes, stories, or activities, and intentional use of names and pronouns inconsistent with a person’s presented gender.”

“The State of Iowa claims it has the power to regulate what churches can teach about human sexuality and how they operate their facilities. The government has absolutely no authority to force a church to violate its religious beliefs. This is a massive violation of the First Amendment,” said Chelsey Youman, a lawyer for First Liberty Institute, who sent the Iowa commission a letter on behalf of another church, Cornerstone World Outreach, insisting it retract these regulations or face a lawsuit.

The commissions’s SOGI guidelines contain “sweeping language forbidding ‘hostility’ and ‘unwelcom[ing]’ speech could be interpreted as restricting Cornerstone’s ability to teach its religious beliefs,” that letter says.

Although Iowa Code § 216.7(2)(a) provides a religious exemption, as drafted, the exemption is unconstitutional. Further, the Commission’s express intent to target churches singularly for enforcement, as stated in the Brochure, is an egregious constitutional violation. The only text in the entire Brochure that is underlined and italicized is the limitation that a bona fide religious institution must act according to a “bona fide religious purpose.” Such emphasis highlights the Commission’s intention to not only heavily scrutinize the validity and sincerity religious doctrines of our client and other religious institutions, but also the very legitimacy of the church as a religious body.

Say What We Want Or We’ll Make Your Life Hell

Simply put, this is insane. It’s totalitarian. It’s a violation of human rights and constitutional rights. It’s a repudiation of the Western system of law. This is a non-checked independent agency that accords no fundamental legal rights — which, by the way, are civil rights! — such as to a jury of one’s peers, legal representation, or presumption of innocence, that can harass, bring up before tribunals, and fine individuals upon receiving a tip-off from some aggrieved individual with unknown motives. It’s no wonder, then, that across the country these kinds of “human rights” commissions are corrupt and have a history of bigotry. For one example: “over a five-year period at least 27 Iowa landlords were allowed to make donations to the Iowa Civil Rights Commission in lieu of being brought up on charges.”

People can be accused and subject to this extralegal pestilence merely upon the basis of someone else’s feelings about being “unwelcome” or “demeaned,” not any tangible harm. In other words, the basis for prosecution can be completely irrational and subjective. This establishes an individual’s feelings as the sole criteria by which to judge the rightness or wrongness of another person’s actions. In other words, this process constitutes being subject to a judge and jury of one individual. The standard for “convicting” the charged, according to the commission itself, is “preponderance of evidence, i.e. more likely than not,” not the more stringent legal standard of “guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.”

People can also be strung up in the Iowa ‘Civil Rights’ Commission for crimespeak, er, expressing 10,000-year-old understandings of the human person that have been dominant among the human race since time immemorial and are common to the orthodox beliefs of every single major world religion. Targets can be forced to undergo social re-education, post public notices of their “shameful” proclivity towards saying what they think, lose contracts and state licenses, and pay punitive fines. In other words, it’s a state-authorized and -executed shakedown. A grumpy person points and sobs on a stand, and another person has to pay $100,000. How in the blazes is this allowed in the United States of America?

This Is Zero-Sum Social System

Many Americans want to believe that if we just give the loud, crabby LGBT people what they want, they will finally be happy and stop screaming at the rest of us. That is, in fact, what the LGBT lobby promised until very recently. “We just want tolerance,” they said. It is now either apparent that they were lying, or that their definition of “tolerance” is far different than that of the average American’s (or both).

In fact, “tolerance” is not the only weasel word the dominant LGBT lobby (because not all gay Americans hate the First Amendment, although you wouldn’t know it from reading most media sources) has used to knife well-meaning Americans in the back. Another word they, and the Left in general, trades upon is “rights.” From the country’s founding, Americans have talked about rights: natural rights, constitutional rights. So we’re used to this language, and to thinking well of it.

But the Left has taken this word, gutted its meaning, and inserted another meaning in its place, while pretending nothing has happened, that their use of this word is the same as it’s always been. It’s been an effective rhetorical trick, not least because most Americans have not been taught to be logical and precise thinkers, nor do they know much about the philosophy that many, especially millennials, now espouse blindly. Presidents Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Delano Roosevelt were the first liberals to give highly visible articulations of the Left’s ideas about rights, which is diametrically opposed to those that created our country and are thus secured in our Constitution.

Their idea of rights was not of rights rooted in truths that transcend feelings, or of rights that restrain government and your fellow man from exploiting you, but of “positive rights” that require government to coerce people into action in service of collectivism. Even Roosevelt, however, maintained a belief in “freedom of speech and expression” and “freedom of every person to worship God in his own way.” Yet his concurrent beliefs in the right of government to compel you into economic activity and to eliminate everyone’s fearful feelings (yes, really: he said humans have a right to “freedom from fear,” essentially endorsing unlimited government) have ultimately come to wage open war on the original and fundamental rights to speak and worship.

The American philosopher John Rawls developed the Left’s understanding of rights into the academic version of what today’s neo-Jacobins seek to actualize. He insisted people could not be free if other people refused to make them feel nice. It’s written in a lot more gobbledygook, but that’s the gist. He did so because he sought to establish a system of justice without resorting to either truth claims or nihilism. What a liberating society his ideas have inaugurated, eh? It’s almost like relativism breeds injustice!

The important thing to understand is that these two visions of rights are ultimately irreconcilable. They cannot coexist. We must uphold one, or the other. Either every man should be free to think, speak, and act in accord with his conscience, or must be censored, shunned, and mentally manipulated according to the thought system of whoever has power. We must once again decide where we stand. The rabid wing of LGBT activism is forcing us to do so. A refusal to decisively answer this question authorizes soft, if not eventually hard, tyranny over fellow American citizens.

Banning Speech Indicates Fear of Opposing Arguments

The most interesting thing to me about this conflict is the speech-haters’ backhanded endorsement of their opponents’ ideas. By demanding that government use its police and tax powers to intimidate and punish their political opponents, they’re demonstrating a remarkable lack of confidence in their ideas. It suggests that, deep down, they agree with their opponents, or at least think their opponents have the stronger argument.

If “love wins,” why does love look a lot like fear? If “love wins,” why is it so tyrannical and intolerant? Why does it require hounding a gay professor out of tenure at a public university, telling a woman who feels triggered in de-sexed locker rooms she’s so ugly she deserved rape as a child, scream down a trio of liberal women (and myriad other speakers) talking gently about bathroom safety, issue death threats to the children of political opponents, tank tiny pizza parlors and flower shops, hound businessmen out of a job for expressing his views through a simple political donation, and force adult sexualization on kindergarteners?

Maybe the ideas and love of those who oppose the militant LGBT agenda is stronger than the ideas and love of those running it. If you think that’s wrong, try letting the ideas and lifestyles you think are superior compete with their opponents on an equal field. If you’re right, you should win. If you’re going to win, why are you so defensive?",https://thefederalist.com/2016/07/06/iowa-bureaucrats-force-trans-bathrooms-on-churches-forbid-non-pc-preaching/,2016-07-06
Trans Bathrooms Are An Assault On Reality And Freedom,"On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a 70-page brief asking a federal judge to halt North Carolina’s law requiring individuals to use government-run showers, changing rooms, and toilets that correspond with their biological sex. President Obama and U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch insist ending sex-specific bathrooms is about the dignity of a marginalized group. But it is really about denying reality and limiting freedom.

After nearly two months of unsuccessful protesting and boycotts from the nation’s most powerful corporations, celebrities, and politicians, North Carolina is refusing to renege over its now-infamous “bathroom bill,” even after making a new, more dangerous enemy in the federal government.

Last month, the DOJ informed Gov. Pat McCrory that North Carolina’s Public Facilities Privacy and Safety Act, or House Bill 2, violates its reinterpretation of federal law about sex parity in education and employment (Titles VII and IX of the Civil Rights Act). The DOJ further warned McCrory that if he didn’t “remedy these violations” by preventing implementation of HB2, the government would take action to ensure compliance—a threat that included withholding billions in federal education funding.

We Don’t Care Who Elected You

The DOJ’s threat was itself an egregious abuse of power, and thankfully McCrory responded by upholding HB2 and filing a lawsuit against the Obama administration, followed by asking a judge to toss the suit in June, as “It would necessitate restructuring the operations of state educational institutions, including the manner in which funding is equitably allocated, athletic teams are organized, and student safety is ensured.”

McCrory has correctly noted that Uncle Sam is once again ”bypassing Congress by attempting to rewrite the law and set restroom policies for public and private employers across the country, not just North Carolina.” The Obama administration responded by filing its own lawsuit against the state, with Lynch insulting every African-American who fought for civil rights by comparing North Carolina’s law to Jim Crow. Yes, you read that right.

While many states across the county are embroiled in disputes over whether governments should confer special bathroom and locker room privileges on transgender individuals, North Carolina is the first state the federal government has tried to explicitly coerce. If McCrory had given in to the demands, it would have set a dangerous precedent and a clear signal that states would be made to pay if they crafted laws that deviate from the ideological agenda of the nation’s executive branch.

Indeed, that the federal government believes it appropriate to threaten the education of millions of students so a tiny sliver of Americans can use the restroom they want despite inconveniencing other people indicates just how far we’ve come down the rabbit hole. This gross overreach reveals the fight to de-sex bathrooms and locker rooms isn’t really about safety or equal rights—it’s about further eroding individual freedom in the name of an ever-expanding centralized state.

First Marriage, Now Bathrooms

With all the political squabbling over bathrooms recently, many folks have been left wondering why places for peeing have become controversial. Restrooms haven’t been an issue for more than a hundred years, and as many people have pointed out, transgender people have been using public facilities for decades, largely without incident. Why bathrooms, and why now?

The answer has nothing to do with the safety or rights of transgender people, and everything to do with enforcing the Left’s new radical gender theory—an agenda that demands we erase sex distinctions in every major social institution.

That’s really what the same-sex marriage fight was about, after all. Under the guise of equal rights, pro-LGBT special-interest groups and politicians convinced huge swaths of the population there is no real difference between men and women, that a consenting union between individuals of the same sex is equal to that of a man and a woman, and that drastically re-defining marriage couldn’t possibly have any negative societal ramifications.

These arguments fly in the face of settled science, contradict the legal arrangements of nearly every human civilization that has ever existed, and reject the fundamental truths that men and women are complementary beings whose union produces the ideal child-rearing environment for a stable society.

But once powerful LGBT special interests in politics and government essentially won the marriage debate last June with the Supreme Court’s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, they were ready to pursue a new avenue to further degrade gender classifications in civil society. Transgender individuals, of course, are a particularly convenient and effective new victim class to use for that end.

Why bathrooms? Because as The New Yorker puts it, they are the “last public vestige of gendered social separation” in a world where virtually all other historical markers of sex distinction have been eradicated. Men and women are no longer segregated in areas they used to be, like church, urban housing, and public transportation. In many cases, removing these barriers has been beneficial, especially in regard to the workplace: there is no good reason to prevent capable women from working alongside men in most career fields (active-duty military is one example of a reasonable exception).

But there are very good and obvious reasons for keeping men and women separate in restroom and showering facilities. Sex-specific bathrooms were originally established not only because of men and women’s distinct hygienic needs, but also because women are far more vulnerable to sexual assault than men, and creating protected areas where only women strip naked prevents sexual violence. While some left-leaning publications have decried this idea as ”paternalistic” and ”antiquated,” the estimated 1 in 6 women who will experience sexual assault (or the 17.7 million existing victims) might disagree.

The Assault on Reality: Accept My Identity, Or Else

The Left’s fight for special transgender preferences regarding bathrooms originates with the social theory of Karl Marx. Marx wrote that in social life “It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness.” Marx’s central idea was that the individual characteristics that shape your behavior and identity are not innate, natural, or objectively true, but instead have been forced on you by ”society.” From this idea we get the notion of “social construct,” a phrase that has become so overused we hardly understand what it means anymore.

Throughout the past few decades, the liberals who dominate all levels of the American education system have succeeded in passing off these unproven socio-political theories as truth. Students are instructed that gender is ”fluid” and part of some arbitrary ”spectrum,” and that it’s perfectly possible someone’s ”true gender” might not match the sex ”assigned” to them at birth—even though basic biological reality contradicts all these theories. Gender theorists insist biology has no influence over whether someone is a man or a woman; it all has to do with self-expression and perception.

To get a glimpse of just how deeply this has been entrenched into the minds of young Americans, take a look at this video, produced by the Family Policy Institute of Washington.



These students could very well be reciting straight from their gender studies textbook, and no one would know the difference. Whether they truly believe what they’re saying is irrelevant. They’ve been trained never to question or doubt anyone’s subjective identity, and if they will say nothing to stand up for truth, then they’re no different than those who reject it.

Countless other examples demonstrate just how far this ideology has penetrated society. Women’s colleges have started accepting men who believe they’re women, co-ed colleges across the country are increasingly adopting de-sexed housing, and in an even more ridiculous example, Minnesota parents recently sued to get their son’s kindergarten class to incorporate transgender theory into the curriculum.

Beyond education, the International Olympic Council recently voted to allow biologically male athletes to compete with women without surgery, and the DOJ mandated that all prisons consider sexual identity over biological sex when deciding where to place inmates. And who could forget how Caitlyn Jenner beat out a veteran and a cancer victim for the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at last year’s ESPYS, all because he got plastic surgery and changed his name?

Open Bathrooms Don’t Help Trans People

Now this is where progressives will say, “Now, wait a minute. Trans people are harassed and victimized on a daily basis. They need these rules to protect them and ensure they have the equal right to use public restrooms.”

Not so fast. When was the last time you heard of a transgender individual being assaulted as a result of being forced to use the wrong bathroom? And what makes you think open bathroom policies would do anything to stop attacks on trans people?

Consider Washington state’s WAC rule 162-32 as an example: it mandates that sex-segregated public facilities grant access based on the legally indefinable terms “gender expression” and “gender identity.” If a man who claims to be a woman uses the ladies’ room to escape harassment he faced in the men’s room, the same men harassing him can simply declare themselves to be women and follow him right in!



The reasoning from the pro-LGBT forces is filled to the brim with contradictions. Take a look at the lawsuit the Obama administration filed against North Carolina: it not only claims that subjective gender identity is pertinent to determining sex—an idea that scientists overwhelmingly reject—but it also stipulates “gender identity is innate,” “transgender status is inextricably linked to one’s sex,” and that “a transgender man’s sex is male while a transgender woman’s sex is female.”

Wait: doesn’t the central dogma of transgenderism rely on the very notion that physical sex and gender identity aren’t linked? Hasn’t the Left assured us it’s completely possible to be “gender fluid,” feeling one day like a man and the next like a woman? The confusion that abounds from this language perfectly illustrates why open-bathroom policies are utter nonsense, irreconcilable with centuries of established law.

By and large, transgender people didn’t ask for this fight. Through my work as the volunteer coordinator for Just Want Privacy, the initiative effort to repeal Washington’s open-bathroom rule, I’ve come into close contact with transgender folk. Some have told us that many trans people hate laws like this—they want to be left alone, to blend in with the crowds of “cisgender” men and women like they’ve been doing for years.

If politicians were really interested in addressing the needs of transgender individuals, they’d focus on the myriad mental health issues that plague transgender people. Instead of attributing suicides to proponents of common-sense bathroom policies, perhaps trans advocates should address the fact that more than 60 percent of individuals with gender dysphoria suffer from additional mental illnesses, which are often the source of their misery. Instead of making sex changes legal for 15-year-olds without parental consent, perhaps they should stop banning life-saving therapy for troubled trans youth.

How Open Bathrooms Make Us Less Free

All open bathrooms really do is diminish individual liberties and increase the regulatory power of a government that, as Lynch illustrated when announcing the federal lawsuit, resembles Big Brother more and more every day.

The trans agenda is predominantly a means to deconstruct our traditional understanding of sex and weaken the autonomy of the family unit.

As The Federalist senior contributor Stella Morabito has explained, the trans agenda is predominantly a means to deconstruct our traditional understanding of sex and, as a consequence, weaken the autonomy of the family unit—that societal institution that constitutes our most fundamental (and most important) barrier to big government. It starts with rhetoric guidelines and language codes, which are notoriously used by cults to inhibit critical thinking and enforce a new regime of ideas.

Skeptical? Just think of all the new words introduced in the wake of the transgender crusade. GLAAD provides a handy online dictionary, which includes acceptable terms like “cisgender” (to describe everyone who doesn’t experience gender dysphoria) and “genderqueer” (to describe someone whose identity is neither male nor female); problematic terms we should avoid saying like “biologically male” and “genetically female;” and guidelines like “always use a transgender person’s chosen name,” and “never put quotation marks around a transgender person’s chosen pronouns.”

Indeed, many of these cultish guidelines have already made their way into law, often alongside trans bathroom legislation. In New York City, for instance, you can now be fined $250,000 if you “misgender” someone. The aforementioned Washington state WAC rule 162-32 goes a step further, criminalizing “unwelcome personal questions about an individual’s sexual orientation, gender expression or gender identity, or transgender status.” That’s right, ladies—if a male undresses in your locker room, it is literally illegal to ask him what he’s doing there, and if you do you can be sued.

Check out the chilling effect this particular rule already had on one woman in Washington state:

In this instance, a man who didn’t even present as a woman was able to change in front of women and girls, and because of the new law, those who actually had female parts were scared into silence. Their only recourse for preventing such violations was to modify their behavior in a space designed to uphold their safety and privacy.

But as Morabito explains, it doesn’t stop there:

If we agree to change language to suit the transgender lobby, we ultimately agree to destroy in law the entire basis (sex distinctions) for the only union that can result in autonomously formed families…



And if the family is no longer accepted as a union that originates through the union of male and female, there is no real basis for the State to recognize any family as an autonomous unit. Without any such obligation, children become more easily classified as state property and our personal relationships are more easily controlled by the state. If that sounds totalitarian, that’s because it is.

The bathroom fight is so culturally and socially significant because if we accept open-bathroom policies like Washington’s, we also implicitly recognize as legitimate the absurd notion that the subjective self-perceptions of “gender identity” are equal to immutable characteristics like race and sex in the context of both society and the law. If we agree to give the state the authority to impose this new understanding of men and women, then we also agree to give the state the power to re-define humanity itself.

The question we should be asking ourselves when we consider the bathroom issue isn’t whether we’re personally comfortable peeing or showering next to a transgender individual. It’s whether we’re ready to endorse the Left’s radical new standard for what it means to be a man or a woman—and the tragic rejection of both freedom and reality that inevitably comes with it.

GOP Didn't Change Platform To Exclude Gay Victims Of Terror,"Judging from the media attention, the GOP platform drafting committee hearing is one of the most important meetings all year. We are blessed to have blow-by-blow coverage of all the self-destructive language, all the piddling issues, and all the partisan squabbling that typifies this sort of event. With the kind of real ammunition the platform committee provides, I’m not sure why some in the media felt the need to mislead people.

Did they? Others also reported that Republicans had scrubbed and stripped “LGBT language” from a plank dealing with Islamic terrorism, even though the GOP had stripped any mention of all individual groups, including Christians, Jews, and women. That certainly gives the news a different context.

In hierarchy of progressive issues, few things are more imperative than pointing out the transgressions “LGBT rights” heretics, so it’s unsurprising that the media is vigilantly on the lookout for thought crimes. In the end, though, Republicans landed on this text: “Radical Islamic terrorism poses an existential threat to personal freedom and peace around the world.” It’s crisp and all-encompassing. Whatever the underlying reasons were for striking the original line — and maybe we don’t need to get into an argument about whom Islamists hate most — it’s the best way to describe the purpose of terror.

Some reporters seem to be creating the impression (or maybe they believe) that conservatives are so homophobic they’re unwilling to accept the notion that radical Islam targets gays, even after Orlando. This is absurd and willfully misleading. Most conservatives have gone out of their way to point out that Islamism is genuinely and violently homophobic. It is often liberals who refuse to acknowledge that radical Islamic terrorism has a purpose and that it is what drove someone to specifically target a gay nightclub.

Generally, the coverage has unfolded exactly as expected. Isn’t it enough that the GOP’s platform still opposes same-sex marriage? It’s like medieval Europe! (Or the DNC, before 2012.) We learned the GOP wouldn’t budge even after an “emotional” and “passionate” speech by Rachael Hoff – and, although I happen to agree with Hoff, you’ll notice that people can be heroically “passionate” about gay marriage and global warming but typically “rail” about guns or traditional marriage.

We also went through a round of jeering because the Republican Party’s preliminary platform nonsensically contemplated endorsing controversial conversion therapy (it never fails to undermine important things by focusing on stupid ones) and included language that declares porn a “public health crisis.” After reading some sneering from liberals online, I read what it says:

The internet must not become a safe haven for predators. Pornography, with its harmful effects, especially on children, has become a public health crisis that is destroying the life of millions. We encourage states to continue to fight this public menace and pledge our commitment to children’s safety and well-being. We applaud the social networking sites that bar sex offenders from participation. We urge energetic prosecution of child pornography which closely linked to human trafficking.

Listen, if I ran a party, I’d throw up the Bill of Rights as the platform and move on. It’s distracting to make a manifesto about every issue that ails every person in the nation. But should the same people who fight to ban plastic bags, big sodas, and transfats be mocking anyone for pointing out that pornography can be destructive and that children have easy access to it? Democrats don’t want to babysit your moral health, they just have very different set of morals. For instance, on the day Democrats go about trying to chill free speech in the Senate again, you’d think the media would have something better to be upset about.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/07/12/no-the-gop-didnt-erase-gay-people-as-isis-targets/,2016-07-12
Trans Lobby Shuts Down Parents Over De-Sexed Bathrooms,"Update: The Fairfax County School Board recently cancelled the public forum referenced below that was scheduled for July 14 at 6:00 p.m.

Fairfax County Public Schools is the tenth-largest school district in America, and the largest in both Virginia and the greater DC area. In May 2015, the Fairfax County School Board introduced a policy purporting to be about non-discrimination against transgender youth. At a meeting discussing the policy, the auditorium was packed to capacity with parents and other citizens who had unaddressed concerns and unanswered questions.

There are no real answers to date. (Only echoes of the usual bullying epithets hurled at those opposed, such as “haters” and “bigots.”) Another community forum is scheduled to begin at 6 p.m. on July 14 at Luther Jackson Middle School in Fairfax County. It is likely when nine members of the board intend to codify the Obama administration’s “Dear Colleague” letter, a document intended to get all on board with the transgender agenda, including de-sexing changing facilities and sports teams, under the guise of anti-discrimination.

It will include new pronoun protocols (which you can be certain will be vigorously policed) that will punish students for not using the pronouns trans peers prefer, and much, much more. You can read Fairfax County’s adaptation of the guideline on this LGBT site. In the end, this policy basically dictates de-sexing all students across the nation. That’s really what this is about.

In caving to pressure from the Obama administration, the board will also put another nail in the coffin of local self-governance, particularly for the county’s schools. Approving the policy amounts to ceding control of a critical facet of school policy to the federal government. That’s a major leap towards nationalizing K-12 education. And that’s ultimately the point of it all.

As always at such forums, organized, well-funded political activists will swarm and do their level best to silence the voices of concerned citizens. When this all began in May 2015, Board Member Elizabeth Schultz was the sole “nay” vote out of 12. Since the November 2015 elections, Schultz gained two more allies on the board when Tom Wilson and Jeannette Hough were elected. Thank goodness for some balance in these unbalanced times, because one thing is certain: the Fairfax board has completely shut down any attempt at real community dialogue. Schultz, Wilson, and Hough will be going up against long political odds once again.

Board Member Stands Up for Due Process and Free Speech

At its June 9, 2016 meeting, the board ramrodded gender identity language into the “Student Rights and Responsibilities” (SR&R) handbook, which all students will be expected to sign this fall as school begins.

This whole meeting was surreal in the board majority’s willingness to pursue an agenda based on an ideology, with almost no understanding of what it was doing. You’ll see for yourself in the videos that follow. The board’s back-room push came 399 days after it ramrodded a resolution adding gender identity to a now-endless list of protected attributes in Fairfax schools. No clarification, no debate, no real community dialogue for 399 days.

This language means students can and will be punished for any infraction interpreted as discrimination, including not adhering to new pronoun protocols or expressing concern about males trying out for female athletic teams. Make no mistake, the guidelines of “gender identity” will be interpreted at whim, because they are subjective standards designed to allow for just that.

The board has also:

Loaded up the Family Life Education Curriculum Advisory Committee with appointees who appear to be hard core in favor of approving a sexually-expansive curriculum beyond the Virginia Board of Education’s standard curriculum.

Gotten county public school employees trained in “cultural competence” in order to facilitate the political agenda of the board’s majority. (Perhaps an example of how this is done comes from the Minnesota Department of Education where an entire “gender identity” training session for public school teachers is recorded on YouTube here.)

Made sure the only community input at open meetings comes from allies of the LGBT agenda. In fact, they typically fill the 10 available speaking slots. It’s rare for a pro-parental rights speaker to get one of those slots, which are given out on a “first come, first served” basis.

Hired a “consultant” without any paper trail on what he was hired to do or has done regarding the sex education curriculum and transgender policies. There appears to be no report from him available to the public (as the board had assured in May 2015) but his resume is heavily LGBT-driven.

Obviously, all of this is not supposed to be obvious. So, when concerned citizens or some concerned school board members shed some sunlight on such things, they tend to get shut down. Some video below illustrates a few such “highlights” of a five-hour meeting on June 9.

Welcome to a Typical Board Meeting

Schultz explained how pushing the policy language through would harm due process, free speech, and the rights of all students: “Poorly done policy is done fast,” she stated. “There’s no consideration for anybody’s privacy when there is no consideration for some people’s privacy. There’s no consideration for anybody’s rights when there consideration only for some people’s rights.”



Schultz entreated the board to consider allowing a time for at least minimal public input, which of course was flatly denied, as it had been over the course of the 399 days since the policy was first pushed.

“You can parse the words as much as you want, but our board cannot be in a position of doing harm. Delaying this by two weeks doesn’t do anything to anybody. . . . I don’t know how many genders we’re going to define, we’re going to support. Don’t you want to know? . . . I don’t know what gender identity even means according to the school system.”

She implored all to understand that having a dialogue about this issue would preserve everybody’s rights, “predominantly your First Amendment rights.” But no-go.

Wilson pleaded for a bit of real community input: “Can we at least set up a committee to talk?” When he asked for a two-week postponement to allow some real community dialogue, it was such a reasonable request that the best the board majority could come up with was the faux concern that there would be a two-week delay in printing up the booklet in time for it to be ready for September. You can’t make this stuff up. Mind you, this is a school system with a $2.7 billion budget that just implemented another major property tax hike this year.

The amendment was read by board member Ryan McElveen, who initiated the whole process of including gender identity as a protected class a year ago. It stated “No student in Fairfax County Public Schools on the basis of age, race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, national origin, marital status, or disability be excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under and education program or activity as required by law.”

But Wilson noted how puzzling the wording was, since the category of “age” is curious for K-12 education. He made the point that no matter how brilliant a three-year-old might be, that child cannot enroll in kindergarten, and neither can a 32-year-old enroll in ninth grade. (This is a subject near and dear to me, as I have written here at the Federalist that age identity discrimination is a far more logical concept than gender identity.)

The big question, Wilson asked, is why there seems to be a “compelling reason to fear conversation?”

Board Member Jeannette Hough simply asked the Board to define gender identity, and the members in favor went totally limp. She tried over and over, and had to repeat her conviction that it was germane to understanding the issue and to voting on any amendment (including one to postpone). Of course it is. The board’s attempt to obfuscate and evade even a simple answer in front of a community anxious to understand is very telling. It is the picture of corruption.

Hough also expressed concerns about what happens to girls’ athletics when males compete on the girls’ teams. Stone silence. Expressions of befuddlement. Finally, the counsel who acted as parliamentarian—who needed help to understand what was being asked—decided a definition of gender identity was not germane to the motion. You can see how in the course of five minutes the board majority did everything they could to avoid answering a very appropriate question.

Hough persisted, saying this issue is complex enough for real town halls and real conversation. Here you can see Chairman Pat Hynes cutting her off because she just wanted some answers. Then Hynes told Hough she is putting staff “on the spot” unfairly. Hough answered: “Yes, we have put them on the spot, because we haven’t had the questions answered and now we’re being asked to hold students accountable for things we don’t have the answers to.”

She continued to try to explain how the regulation creates more questions than it answers for students regarding their rights and responsibilities. We can all see what a brick wall political front this is, but it’s astonishing how easily people are programmed to go along with crafted propaganda manipulations such as the gender identity canard.

Hough later asked Superintendent Karen Garza how they would determine if there was discrimination without a clear definition of gender identity. Watch the silence, followed by the claim that this is a “legal question.” Another question, from Schultz: “Does gender identity apply to a male who identifies as male?” (Now is that a great question? How about a female who identifies as female? Is it discrimination to force a female female to share a restroom with, well, a male? To compete in an athletic event against a male?)

When she asked the question directly to McElveen, the initiator of the policy change, he stated he didn’t know the answer and then told her that her line of questioning was “inappropriate.” Schultz expressed reasonable outrage that question wasn’t even answerable. At that point, Hynes pulled the floor out from under Schultz and abruptly called for the vote.

Schultz summed it all up: “This is the problem with messy problem done quickly without engagement for real policy. Regulation enacts the policy. And it’s gone 399 days without one single board conversation about what it means to enact a policy.” Obviously, transparency in government is on serious life support.

Theater of the Absurd Does not Make Good Government

The farce of Fairfax County School Board meetings like this one is being played out all over the land. It’s an ancient story: Ironclad political majorities and bureaucrats who blindly guard their sinecures versus precious few principled leaders (if you’re lucky enough to have them) who understand and respect the concept of representative government.

We can see in action the way abusive politicians and autocratic bureaucracies punish any voice of dissent. Their tactic is to tease out a spiral of silence to provide greater cover for opaque government and power-mongering. The goal of smear tactics is always the same: total conformity and compliance with total power that is consolidated into the hands of a few, and to kill due process. All in the name of “anti-discrimination” or “freedom.” As usual.

Anyone who thinks this whole chapter ends with rights for transgender students hasn’t been paying attention. That isn’t the way the spiral of power works. This is about consolidating power. As Lord Acton famously noted, absolute power corrupts absolutely. Gender identity is a nice pathway for that because it does so many things to separate people from one another. Just look at the regulations.

What Would Mr. Rogers Say?

The regulations begin with the concocted meme/myth that everybody’s sex—including yours, no matter who you are—was “assigned at birth.” The transgender project injected this false and appalling canard, intended to apply universally, into public discourse. The phrase is intended to tell everybody, including each and every child, that their sex is not real. Instead, it was somehow “assigned” to them by a doctor or someone. How destabilizing is that?

The phrase is intended to tell everybody, including each and every child, that their sex is not real.

What would Fred Rogers say about that? Remember him? He died in 2003, but was a beloved children’s television host still feted as a hero by leftist “progressives” such as Hillary Clinton. What they won’t tell you is that Mr. Rogers often sang to children to explain that they were fine as boys and girls “just the way” they were born. “Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood” was a show devoted to helping children navigate the line between reality and “the land of make believe.”

His song on sex differences is called “Everybody’s Fancy, Everybody’s Fine.” It’s about how some of us are born boys (fancy on the outside) and some of us are born girls (fancy on the inside). These lines from his song would probably be enough to get Mr. Rogers a seven-figure fine and imprisonment today. Listen: “Boys are boys from the beginning. (When you’re born a boy baby, you grow up to be a bigger boy and then a man.) Girls are girls right from the start. (When you’re born a girl baby, you become a bigger girl and then a woman.)”

Yet, there is total surrealism today between Mr. Rogers’ intent and the connection between Hillary Clinton and the Fred Rogers Foundation. No doubt Hillary Clinton and the politicized majority of the Fairfax County School Board would shut him up if he sang that song today.

Let’s Stop Mind-Hacking the Kids

Destabilizing a child’s identity—hacking kids’ minds when they are just trying to establish the difference between fantasy and reality—is so wrong. Destabilizing their families through gender ideology is also wrong. And it’s the beginning of a dystopic society.

Throughout history we have seen this sort of transformation due to political correctness happen time and again. Social pressures pushed quickly and stealthily cause people to sign on to any number of far-fetched notions they would have discounted in more clear-headed times.

Disregard for process and dialogue in the case of the Fairfax County School Board is bound to lead to undermining process in other cases throughout the nation. In the course of world history, undermining due process and bowing to groupthink has led to some very disturbing events.

In short, if these false illusions aren’t stopped and if some form of due process is not resurrected the state will gain total control over each and every action of each and every child, and their parents.

Why Is This Catholic University Trashing Catholic Teaching On Sexuality?,"Refusing to play according to the rules of Catholic morality, Loyola Marymount University (LMU) in Los Angeles has enlisted a notable alumnus to send a message to students that they should be perfectly comfortable with same-sex attraction and same-sex relationships. It’s just one more way the Jesuit university has compromised its Catholic mission by promoting the “LGBT” (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) agenda.

The LMU website homepage publicizes a video running more than nine minutes that features former baseball player Billy Bean. Bean was a star at LMU, married a woman he met at LMU (lasting three years), and played eight years in Major League Baseball until 1995.

Bean had a modest baseball career, but made headlines in 1999 for being the first current or former MLB player to publicly talk about having same-sex attraction and a hidden “gay” sex life since he was 28 years old. Now he’s a vice president of the MLB and an activist for the “LGBT community” in baseball.

Worse, he’s pitching his message to LMU students. The video coincides with an LMU Magazine interview with Bean, who is featured on the cover of the summer 2016 edition. His “Distinguished Alumni” profile on the LMU website says he “speaks to students about the importance of diversity and accepting others for who they are.” That’s a rather tame description of what Bean really does. He is specifically focused on promoting acceptance of LGBT behaviors and lifestyle choices as part of his push for “inclusion.”

Like Everyone, I Struggle with Sin

The first half of the video interview is basically just a profile and success story, similar to what other colleges might produce to highlight notable alumni. No problem there. But the second half of the video focuses on Bean’s personal and professional struggles with his same-sex attraction, and it looks favorably on his current MLB activism.

Bean gets choked up at certain points telling his story, and it’s clear he has suffered emotionally along his journey. He mentions the passing of his same-sex partner, who died of an HIV-related sickness, and losing one of his best friends in a car accident. He talks about being “closeted” and what happened when he publicly disclosed his same-sex attraction.

“The world is not a perfect place,” says Bean. “We still have discrimination by race, by gender, by religion.” He says his job now is “to be a resource and introduce a conversation about inclusion and acceptance.” The word “Catholic” is never mentioned in the video interview, and neither is “Jesuit.” There are no references to God or chastity.

I contacted LMU for an explanation of the message the university hoped to convey to students and the community with this video. The woman I spoke with on the phone stated that she found my inquiry rather odd, but said she would get back to me. No further response was received prior to publication. I also reached out to Bean, but he didn’t respond.

LMU Director of Athletics Bill Husak appears in the video praising Bean, saying he “really epitomizes what LMU’s hopes are for each and every student. It is to go ahead and be of service. It is to be a person for others.” Husak says Bean exemplifies “those social justice tenets that are espoused” at LMU and praises his work with Major League Baseball: “I don’t think there’s a better person who could fill that office and fill the duties that are expected of that office than Billy.”

Bean the Activist

When MLB hired Bean in July 2014 to be its first “ambassador for inclusion,” the League announced:

In his new role, Bean, who made public that he is gay in 1999, will provide guidance and training related to efforts to support those in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community throughout Major League Baseball. He will work with Major and Minor League Clubs to encourage equal opportunity in accordance with the joint MLB-MLBPA Workplace Code of Conduct. Bean also will develop educational training initiatives against sexism, homophobia and prejudice…

MLB promoted Bean in January this year to the position of “Vice President, Social Responsibility & Inclusion.”

“In his elevated role, Bean will be responsible for many of the League’s social responsibility initiatives, including oversight of MLB’s Workplace Code of Conduct and anti-bullying programming, while continuing to facilitate inclusion strategies with a focus on the LGBT community,” the MLB said.

Last year, Bean penned a column for MLB celebrating the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage. Bean wrote:

By overturning the Sixth Circuit’s ruling on Obergefell vs. Hodges (sic), the Supreme Court struck down same-sex marriage bans and, at long last, brought marriage equality to all 50 states. The cynical part of me was filled with worry in the days leading up to the ruling, but as soon as I read the text messages of joy that kept pouring in this morning, I was overcome with emotion.



Immediately my thoughts went back to 1995, when I was walking out of the hospital just moments after my partner, Sam, died in a San Diego emergency room. Being in the closet had made our world more difficult than you can imagine, and I could not help but wonder how different the world is now than it was then.



Today’s ruling is important to me personally, but I also know it will have a very important impact on this generation of Major and Minor Leaguers. I am so proud of MLB for its unwavering support of our message of inclusion. The San Francisco Giants and the Tampa Bay Rays, in particular, deserve mention, as both organizations signed an amicus brief in this case, showing support for their communities and employees, and making an inclusive statement that was loud and clear.

When then-New York Mets player Daniel Murphy, now with the Washington Nationals, told a reporter that “as a Christian” he disagreed with Bean’s “lifestyle” of actively engaging in same-sex activity, Bean expressed hope Murphy would “reconcile his religious beliefs with his interpretation of the word lifestyle” and “fully accept my sexual orientation.”

Husak’s praise for Bean’s work with MLB in the video and LMU’s promotion of the interview are serious conflicts with the Jesuit university’s Catholic mission. It appears LMU’s LGBT Student Services office is likewise a problem. When the LGBT office was established in 2010, the university gave a statement to LifeSiteNews indicating it would promote chastity and the church’s teachings on marriage:

[A] form response was provided outlining the office’s goals of inclusivity and stating that ‘being gay or lesbian is not a sin,’ that the Catholic Church recognizes only marriage between a man and a woman, and that LMU urges celibacy among non-married students. ‘The Church’s position beyond that is pastoral, one of outreach and counseling a life of celibacy to the LGBT community,’ stated the document. ‘We realize that this may be a difficult cross to bear, but the Church only approves of sexual relations between a man and a woman within the confines of marriage.’

But in the LMU Magazine interview, Bean praises LMU’s LGBT Student Services office on campus as “incredible” for “allowing kids to be who and what they are,” clearly referring to identities and lifestyles that are not consistent with Catholic teaching.

Ignoring Church Teaching

The website for LMU’s LGBT Student Services doesn’t publicly mention a focus on chastity anywhere. LMU also suggests as resources for students a number of activist organizations that are openly opposed to Catholic teaching on marriage and human sexuality, including the Human Rights Campaign; Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG); and Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN).

LMU’s decision to put so much effort into promoting same-sex behavior, same-sex marriage, and gender ideology is extremely concerning.

The office’s website also promotes the acceptance of “gender identity” instead of biological sex. This radical gender ideology is at odds with church teaching and has been declared destructive to the culture and the family by Pope Francis.

The Facebook page for the LGBT Student Services office routinely posts messages in support of same-sex marriage, same-sex behavior, and gender ideology. Going back to November 2015, not once has the office posted anything on its Facebook page emphasizing church teaching on marriage and sexuality.

In another display of LMU’s unwillingness to defend Catholic teaching, an unbelievable situation erupted on campus earlier this year when a long-time LMU employee was placed on leave for opposing gender ideology and same-sex behavior after being accused of a “hate crime” by students. The employee’s disagreement with students happened during an LMU “Rainbow Week” event celebrating the “LGBT community.” The LGBT Student Services office sponsored the week of events.

LMU’s decision to put so much effort into promoting same-sex behavior, same-sex marriage, and gender ideology is extremely concerning. The position of the Catholic Church on these matters is clear, and any effort to lead students away from the church — away from Jesus and into sin — endangers the eternal souls of the students in the university’s care. This isn’t just a problem at LMU, it’s an issue at a number of Catholic colleges across the country.

Especially now when our culture and government are attempting to force social acceptance of radical sexual agendas, especially on young people, we need our Catholic colleges to be steadfast in defending the truth about God’s creation of man and woman and his gift of sexuality, described so beautifully by Saint John Paul II in his “Theology of the Body.” Both Catholic and non-Catholic students, those with same-sex attraction and those with opposite-sex attraction, deserve to hear this truth.

"Pressed By Common Core And LGBT Agenda, More Families Homeschool","Homeschooling has grown 62 percent in the past decade, and in the era of Common Core and transgender bathroom dictates, that growth has only accelerated. This past school year, homeschooling grew in Florida at its biggest rate in a decade: “We see all the emails from parents: ‘I just don’t want my kids exposed to Common Core,’ ” Karen Harmon, chairwoman of a Florida homeschool support group, told The Florida Times-Union. “Their thought process is that it’s dumbing down the school systems and making all students average, but a lot of parents want their child to excel.”

That trend is playing out across the country. Local newspapers and homeschool leaders from West Virginia to Alabama and North Carolina to Texas report a surge in homeschooling interest and enrollment in just the past year or two.

One major reason families homeschool is for academic quality. The United States spends roughly $12,000 per student on education, which is more than every other country in the world except Lichtenstein. While our math and science scores have improved slightly over the last few years, we still rank in the middle of the global pack.

In addition, LGBTQ activists have successfully inundated schools with their approved ideology inside sex education that starts now as early as kindergarten. With these problems in public schools and many families unwilling or unable to afford the cost of private schooling, more and more families are choosing homeschooling as an alternative. This ensures they can avoid educational indolence and moral apathy while picking and choosing what learning method, curriculum, and schedule works best for their family.

Every year my own homeschool circle increases and there are waiting lists for the cooperative classes we participate in—and I live in a state that boasts some of the wealthiest counties and highest-praised public school systems in the country. Data released last year from the U.S. Department of Education shows that “between 2003-2012, the number of American children between ages 5 to 17 who are homeschooled has risen 61.8 percent, and that the percentage homeschooled in that age range has increased from 2.2 to 3.4 percent.” Parents are pursuing a style of education they can control that will enrich their children, now with very little fear of the stigma that used to surround it.

One of the Nation’s Biggest Homeschool Conventions

A look inside one of the many homeschool conventions that take place over the summer shows just how much the homeschool movement has grown in the last several years. I attended the Home Educators of Virginia’s (HEAV) annual homeschool convention this summer. It’s the second-largest state homeschool convention and the largest in Virginia, boasting 14,000 home educators, speakers, and students from the area.

The first things I notice, almost simultaneously, are how huge the event is and how normal everyone looks. Homeschooling families have long been stigmatized as unsocialized, nerdy, and awkward. Sure, you’ll find your denim-wearing crowd nowadays, but they are a minority. Much of the 14,000 attendees appeared, if I do say so myself, like typical, even hip-looking, Americans.

Indeed, homeschooling parents are better educated than your average American—nearly 50 percent of homeschooling moms have bachelor’s degrees and 20 percent of dads have master’s degrees, compared to a third of the American population with a bachelor’s currently and just 8 percent with a master’s. After discarding outdated notions of what kind of people these are, you can breathe easier and enjoy the benefits of the convention, which are three-fold: hundreds of curriculum choices, 150 workshops, and community.

For three days, HEAV hosted 150 workshops, on everything from parenting to math, to marriage encouragement and money management. A sample: “Ten Ways to Stop Defiance, Disrespect and Meltdowns” (host Kirk Martin), “Teaching Mathematics with Art” (Tom Clark), and “When You Have a Child Who Is Not Driven” (Sherri Seligson).

One of the biggest demonstrations of what a large phenomenon homeschooling has become is the sheer amount of curriculum now available. Two decades ago, parents had only a few options; this summer the exhibit hall at HEAV was filled with hundreds of booths for vendors and groups. Here, parents can touch and see myriad curricula to determine which is right for their family.

Why Homeschooling Matters

At a recent forum at The Heritage Foundation to promote her new book, “They’re Your Kids,” homeschooler, radio host, and actress Sam Sorbo said, “Education is the beginning and end of everything.” She said the United States spends $600 billion on public K-12 education each year and the system has experienced nine major reforms in 27 years, yet still our student achievement has stagnated, at best. Many fed-up parents who desire academic challenges for their children are choosing homeschooling.

I spoke to Wanda McMahon, a representative of Virginia’s National Black Home Educators, who said their group of about 200 members exists to support and encourage the African American parents who have chosen to homeschool for very specific reasons. According to the National Home Education Research Institute, about 220,000 African American kids are being homeschooled, and “Black families have become one of the fastest-growing demographics in homeschooling, with black students making up an estimated 10 percent of the homeschooling population.”

McMahon said African Americans homeschool to avoid “social promotion, to avoid the ‘school to prison pipeline,’ and to avoid stereotypes that might keep their kids from progressing in public school,” but this doesn’t come without a price. “Minorities have fought so much to be integrated the system, now that they’re trying to be successful outside of it they can be frowned upon.” Still, McMahon said, “people love homeschooling because there is so much failure within the African American community—it’s a way they can succeed.”

In a way, it’s unfortunate that our educational and societal decline has contributed to homeschooling becoming increasingly mainstream. That said, it was a classic education technique for centuries, and the return to it only proves once again that government handles very few tasks well.

In an article on homeschooling a few years ago, National Review’s Kevin Williamson summed up the social power of homeschooling: “There is exactly one authentically radical social movement of any real significance in the United States, and it is not Occupy, the Tea Party, or the Ron Paul faction. It is homeschoolers, who, by the simple act of instructing their children at home, pose an intellectual, moral, and political challenge to the government-monopoly schools, which are one of our most fundamental institutions and one of our most dysfunctional. Like all radical movements, homeschoolers drive the establishment bats.”

Report Debunks ‘Transgender’ Label For Kids,"A stunning new report on sexuality and gender exposes the shaky science behind the LGBT “born that way” narrative and the push to label young kids as “transgender.” The report comes as the health-care industry, pressured by the Obama administration, imposes new protocols pertaining to “sexual orientation and gender identity” grounded in faulty science and often dismissive of parents’ rights and children’s well-being.

The report, “Sexuality and Gender: Findings from the Biological, Psychological and Social Sciences,” is co-authored by two psychiatric experts affiliated with Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Dr. Paul McHugh and Dr. Lawrence Mayer. Published by The New Atlantis (a journal of technology and society) and dedicated to “the LGBT community” and “children struggling with their sexuality and gender,” the report aims to prompt further research to help provide the LGBT population with “the understanding, care, and support they need to lead healthy, flourishing lives.”

“This report is about science and medicine, nothing more and nothing less,” the lead author, Mayer, writes. A “sober assessment of the science” led the authors to decry the “great chasm” between “public discourse” and “what science has shown” about sexual orientation and gender identity, particularly among children. Indeed, the report indicates that many of our prevailing cultural narratives and health-care practices regarding the LGBT population have little or no sound scientific basis.

Here Are the Key Findings

The full report deserves to be read in its entirety. Several years in the making, it’s a careful, nuanced analysis of the weight of scientific evidence on sexual orientation, gender identity, and LGBT mental health. The report doesn’t shrink from findings perhaps more palatable to progressives than conservatives or vice-versa, and the authors are quick to point out existing gaps in the research. They conclude with a call for more high-quality research and “an ongoing public conversation regarding human sexuality and identity.”

That said, the report’s conclusions clearly challenge many progressive LGBT talking points. Major findings are summarized below. (Note: all quotations are from the report.)

“Born that way” is a myth. “The understanding of sexual orientation as an innate, biologically fixed property of human beings—the idea that people are ‘born that way’—is not supported by scientific evidence…Genes constitute only one of the many key influences on behavior in addition to environmental influences, personal choices, and interpersonal experiences.”

Sexual orientation is fluid, hard to measure, and has multiple dimensions. The view that “homosexuality or heterosexuality is in any given person unchangeable and determined entirely apart from choices, behaviors, life experiences, and social contexts…is not a view that is well-supported by research…Sexual orientation may be quite fluid.” An “ambiguous” term, “sexual orientation” may refer to one or more measurable dimensions: “attractions, behaviors, identity” and “belonging to a certain community.”

Further research should assess correlations between childhood sexual abuse and sexual orientation. Non-heterosexuals are two to three times as likely as heterosexuals to have experienced childhood sexual abuse.

Non-heterosexuals are at “elevated risk” for mental health problems and suicide. Compared to the general population, non-heterosexual sub-populations have an “elevated risk for a variety of adverse health and mental health outcomes,” with “nearly 2.5 times the risk of suicide.” “[T]he rate of lifetime suicide attempts across all ages of transgender individuals is estimated at 41%” (compared to under 5 percent in theoverall U.S. population).

Social stigma and stress are incomplete explanations for poor mental health. “The social stress model probably accounts for some of the poor mental health outcomes experienced by sexual minorities, though the evidence supporting the model is limited, inconsistent and incomplete.” Further studies are needed.

Science does not support de-linking gender identity and biological sex. “The hypothesis that gender identity is an innate, fixed property of human beings that is independent of biological sex—that a person might be ‘a man trapped in a woman’s body’ or ‘a woman trapped in a man’s body’—is not supported by scientific evidence.” Brain studies “do not provide any evidence for a neurobiological basis for cross-gender identification.”

Sex-reassignment surgery is not a panacea. Compared to the general population, adults who underwent sex-reassignment surgery continued to have a higher risk of experiencing poor mental health outcomes, including being 19 times more likely to die of suicide.

Most children desist from childhood cross-gender identification. “Only a minority of children who experience cross-gender identification will continue to do so into adolescence or adulthood.” “[N]o one can determine the gender identity of a two-year-old.”

“Premature” interventions for gender-dysphoric children are alarming. “The severity and irreversibility of some interventions being publicly discussed and employed for children” are alarming and disturbing. “Therapies, treatments, and surgeries seem disproportionate to the severity of the distress being experienced by these young people, and are…premature since the majority of children who identify as the gender opposite their biological sex will not continue to do so as adults.”

“[L]ittle scientific evidence” supports the value of therapeutic intervention to “delay puberty or modify the secondary sex characteristics of adolescents,” although some children may experience “improved psychological well-being if they are encouraged … in their cross-gender identification.” However, the report urges “caution” because of the “lack of reliable studies on the long-term effects” of those interventions.

Young kids are not transgender. Other factors likely explain their gender difficulties. “There is no evidence that all children who express gender-atypical thoughts or behavior should be encouraged to become transgender.” At least one “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders” criterion for diagnosing gender dysphoria (e.g., child exhibits a “strong preference for the toys, games, or activities stereotypically used or engaged in by the other gender”) is “unsound,” according to the report.

Furthermore, even when children do “identify as a gender opposite their biological sex, diagnoses of gender dysphoria are simply unreliable. The reality is that they may have psychological difficulties in accepting their biological sex as their gender” for other reasons, including uncomfortable gender expectations or trauma.

What Could This Change?

So what does this report mean, in practical terms? For starters, it gives all of us greater insight on the extent to which ideology has been driving health-care policies.

An ideological partnership among LGBT organizations, the progressive medical establishment, and the Obama administration has used erroneous narratives about sexuality and gender, based on thin science, to advance their policy agendas. (Expanding coverage for transgender surgeries under the Affordable Care Act, along with current pressure on states to extend coverage for assisted reproductive technology to “infertile” same-sex couples are recent examples.)

This new report gives us language and authority to push back, as it challenges these false narratives, and by extension, the policy protocols that rely on them. Although it’s impossible, in one column, to analyze the many policies implicated in the Left’s false narratives around sexuality and gender, we offer a few examples below, focused on children.

Federal Data Collection Violates Kids’ Privacy

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released new rules in October 2015 “mandat[ing] the inclusion of sexual orientation and gender identity” (SOGI) data in the demographic section of Electronic Health Records systems. Although federal rules specify that clinicians do not have to ask every patient to provide this information, once the forms and intake procedures are standardized according to this protocol, patients (especially adolescents) are unlikely to realize they have the freedom not to answer. LGBT organizations have pushed for SOGI intake questions for political reasons: by validating their numbers, they become “visible” and acquire increased leverage for targeted health benefits.

Their answers to these questions will follow them the rest of their lives.

Under HHS “best practices,” electronic health records will soon include these questions on sexual orientation and gender identity: “Do you think of yourself as: Straight or heterosexual; Lesbian, gay, or homosexual; Bisexual; Something else, please describe. Don’t know.” “What is your current gender identity? (Check all that apply.) Male; Female; Transgender male/Trans man/Female-to-male; Transgender female/Trans woman/Male-to-female; Genderqueer, neither exclusively male nor female; Additional gender category/(or other), please specify; Decline to answer.”

Children, adolescents, and young adults, whose sexual attractions, feelings, and behaviors might be confused or in flux, will be pressured to self-identify according to ideological—not scientifically measurable—categories, using terms that are unclear, ambiguous, and subject to change. Their answers to these questions will follow them the rest of their lives. This is hardly fair to young children and adolescents, who will be asked prematurely to label sexual feelings or claim identities without fully understanding either what they mean or the implications of their responses.

Further, if the Family Equality Council, an LGBT advocacy organization, has its way, federal rules on data collection will soon require that children in the adoption and foster care systems be asked about their gender identity (including whether they are transgender) beginning at age three, and their sexual orientation beginning at age ten. What do you think: evidence-based policies? Or ideology?

LGBT-Friendly Offices Normalize LGBT Identities

Another example is as close as your pediatrician’s office. Most pediatricians now conduct a psychosocial interview (typically the HEEADSSS questionnaire) as part of a child’s physical—usually after showing parents the door, “because a parent’s presence is likely to limit how much sensitive information the patient will provide.” The psychosocial interview includes recommended questions about sexual attraction. “Are you interested in boys? Girls? Both? Not sure?”

That’s bad enough. But in 2013, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a policy statement (and technical guidance) on “Office-Based Care for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning Youth.” The policy advises physicians on how to create a welcoming environment for “sexual minority” youth—and reminds docs to jettison hetero-normative assumptions because any (or every) child might be LGBT.

If a child or adolescent admits to gender confusion, the AAP policy instructs pediatricians, in one smooth segue, to “provide the opportunity to acknowledge and affirm their feelings of gender dysphoria and desires to transition to the opposite gender.” The desire to transition is assumed, with no suggestion that the gender dysphoria might have other causes, or that transition might not be desirable.

LGBT Kids and Recalcitrant Parents

In 2014, Oregon began to sponsor puberty blockers for minors under Medicaid. It’s not terribly difficult to begin treatment: just visit a counselor to obtain a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, and then off to the endocrinologist. The only problem, it seems, comes from “recalcitrant” parents who slow the process down.

Unless something changes, parents will find it increasingly difficult to find clinicians willing to flout the ideology-based treatment protocols.

But at least Oregonian parents have the opportunity to be recalcitrant. In five states plus the District of Columbia, parents don’t even have that option. Their ability to choose treatment for a child’s sexuality-related psychological issues is restricted by bans on conversion therapy. Although such bans might be laudable in some respects, preventing truly abusive practices, they also likely have a chilling effect on a parent’s ability to pursue treatment for a child’s comorbid psychiatric disorders, and may prevent parents and the child from pursing desired treatment consistent with religious or moral beliefs.

Unless something changes, parents will find it increasingly difficult to find clinicians willing to flout the ideology-based treatment protocols. When accusations—even false ones—that a clinician practices “conversion” therapy are enough to get an international expert like Dr. Kenneth Zucker fired from his practice (because he happened to be successful in helping to resolve children’s gender dysphoria), you can be sure that the average clinician won’t go near treatment plans that even hint at client change, no matter what the research says.

The report by Dr. McHugh and Dr. Meyer is a valuable wake-up call, reminding us that when ideology, cloaked in the narrative of settled science, drives medical decision-making, it’s the vulnerable who will suffer most.

The Reason Trump Shouldn’t Speak At Catholic Universities,"Was it “appalling and disgraceful” that Sacred Heart University, a Catholic institution, recently allowed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to hold a campaign rally on campus?

It can be difficult to cut through the blatant opportunism of both anti-Trump critics and Sacred Heart’s president, whose defense of the event (but not Trump) only thinly disguises his university’s play for media attention and the prestige of hosting a presidential candidate. Both sides claim concern for Sacred Heart’s Catholic identity.

The Fairfield, Connecticut university has come under fire from a number of angry commenters, especially on the university’s Facebook page, expressing outrage that Sacred Heart has betrayed its Catholic identity and mission by hosting Trump. The wealthy developer has been accused of nastiness, bigotry, inciting violence and “the promotion of evil.” Trump would obviously deny any of this and claim he was misunderstood. But he does hold some positions that are clearly contrary to Catholic teaching, such as his support for abortion in certain cases.

Sacred Heart President Dr. John Petillo claims the political rally on campus was an appropriate means of educating students, and denies any implication that the university compromised its Catholic identity. He also denies what seems to be the worse crime for both Petillo and his critics: that by hosting the rally, Sacred Heart implied support for Trump’s candidacy.

I happen to agree that Sacred Heart should not have allowed the Trump rally on campus, precisely because it is a Catholic university. But to understand why, we have to look beyond political opportunism and a university’s reach for secular prestige. It’s worthwhile to first examine some of what Sacred Heart does actively and unapologetically sponsor on campus — which apparently those protesting Trump’s visit aren’t that upset about.

Catholic Identity Concerns

This is the same university that last year invited former U.S. Senator and Majority Leader George Mitchell to speak at commencement and awarded him an honorary degree. Mitchell was the champion of the Freedom of Choice Act during his time in the Senate, which would have made abortion protection mandatory in state and federal laws.

Sacred Heart also continues to have former World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) CEO Linda McMahon serve as vice chairman of its board despite her public support for legalized abortion during her failed U.S. Senate campaigns. The university even named a new building after McMahon.

Trump has said mean things, and he’s certainly no model for Catholic values. But Trump has never cast a vote supporting the murder of millions of innocent babies. He has also never officially represented a Catholic institution while publicly promoting anti-Catholic positions.

In addition to honoring those who support the grave moral evil of abortion, Sacred Heart exhibits a complete lack of concern for the souls of its students, church teaching, and its Catholic identity in the manner in which it publicly addresses sexuality.

In the “LGBTQ Resources” section of its website, the university tells students: “Here at the Sacred Heart University Counseling Center, we embrace a positive view of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) identities and relationships.” The statement goes on to insist that Sacred Heart isn’t concerned about right and wrong when it comes to gender and sexuality. Such statements directly contradict Catholic teaching, and can only lead students to embrace mortal sin and separation from God. The university also sponsors a Gay-Straight Alliance (GSA) club on campus that is “trying to combat” opposition to same-sex relationships.

A separate LGBTQ Resources section endorses the organizations Consortium of Higher Education LGBT Resource Professionals, PFLAG, and Campus Pride — all of which support same-sex marriage in opposition to church teaching. Campus Pride is also the organizer of the “Shame List,” which attacks Catholic colleges for defending their religious freedom by requesting exemptions to Title IX’s “gender identity” provisions.

In its resources for women, the university suggests female students visit the websites of the pro-abortion National Organization for Women (NOW) and the NOW Foundation. Under “General Health,” Sacred Heart points female students to websites such as Go Ask Alice, which provides non-medical and morally objectionable advice.

Additionally, a “Healthy Habits” newsletter series intended for Sacred Heart employees that bears the university’s logo encouraged using birth control to prevent pregnancy — a mortal sin according to Catholic teaching. No mention of Catholic teaching was included.

This information was found doing a cursory search of the university’s website. It’s likely the Catholic identity abuses are even deeper and more widespread. With this in mind, it does seem that the sudden outrage and selective concern about Sacred Heart’s Catholicity from those who oppose Trump is more politically motivated than religiously motivated.

University Defends Trump Event

In a blog post published the day before Trump’s campaign stop, Petillo admitted “there have been negative responses” to Trump’s visit “based on opposition to his philosophies, opinions and pronouncements.” He added: “Some also have questioned whether—as a Catholic university—we should allow him access to our facilities, as some of his stances and proclamations appear contrary to our religious beliefs and values.”

This is a serious issue for any Catholic college to consider when allowing guest speakers on campus. By their very nature, private Catholic colleges have a mission that is distinct and unique in comparison to public secular colleges. A Catholic college isn’t meant to serve as a forum where all ideas are equally valid and carry equal weight — as public colleges pretend is the case on their campuses. Abortion is always wrong, sex outside of marriage — that is, marriage as the church understands it — is always wrong, etc. Truth exists in the Catholic tradition, and Catholic educational institutions have a responsibility to try and lead students to truth.

But Petillo just throws his hands up and says that if they used the criteria of evaluating and approving guest speakers based on their public positions being contrary to the Catholic faith, “[W]e would eliminate candidates from both [political] parties.” What would be so bad about that? It might actually be better for Sacred Heart, and its students, in the long run.

The straw-man argument Petillo then lays down is that by not allowing politicians to speak on campus, the university “would be absent from the [political] discussion and the democratic process.” Nonsense. Do they not have televisions or the Internet at Sacred Heart? There are a myriad of other — and more appropriate — ways to involve students and staff in discussions of political issues.

Worse, Petillo claims it would be “an injustice to our students” to not allow politicians an open, unopposed platform to spout their campaign rhetoric:

It has long been our policy to open our doors to a wide variety of speakers on an equally diverse range of topics, regardless of party affiliation, religious beliefs, nationality, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation. Our goal then, as now, was to promote open dialogue. To do less would be an injustice to our students and to our commitment to providing our educational community the broadest possible exposure and learning.

Just as there is no “open dialogue” with controversial figures giving commencement addresses, there is not open dialogue with politicians giving campaign speeches. The dialogue only goes one way: from the speaker to the crowd. Where is the voice of the university — and the Catholic church — in this situation? Administrators and professors may never appropriately address the impressions and ideas left on campus in the speaker’s wake.

The question that really should be asked is: “How is a Catholic college serving its mission and adhering to its responsibilities by giving open platforms to those opposed to the truths of the faith?” In seeking to be more like secular colleges, most Catholic colleges have ignored seriously considering this question for far too long. What’s at stake is nothing less than the eternal souls of those in their care.

"Study: Gay, Bisexual Teens More Likely To Engage In Risky Behavior","The Centers for Disease Control recently released its first national study on the health risks of gay, lesbian, and bisexual (LGB) teenagers’ behaviors. What they found, using more than 15,000 respondents and other data, indicates LGB students face more bullying, participate in far more relationship abuse, and are more likely to use drugs and drink alcohol.

According to the CDC, 2 percent of students identified as gay or lesbian, while 89 percent said they are heterosexual. Six percent defined themselves as bisexual, and 3 percent were not certain.

More than 54 percent of respondents had engaged in sexual contact, with some students having such activities with both sexes. “Nationwide, 48.0% of students had had sexual contact with only the opposite sex, 1.7% had had sexual contact with only the same sex, 4.6% had had sexual contact with both sexes, and 45.7% had had no sexual contact.” More than nine out of 10 students who had no sexual relations identified as heterosexual, with 6 percent saying they are LGB.

Sexual Minorities Are More At-Risk

The study asked students about more than 100 different activities, from drinking milk to suicide attempts. Key findings on dangerous activities include: students who had engaged in bisexual or same-sex sexual relationships were far more likely to drink alcohol, use drugs, smoke cigarettes, and use hard drugs. They were also twice as likely as heterosexual teens to be threatened or injured on school property by a weapon, and more than twice as likely to miss school for “safety concerns.” More than one-third of LGB students said they faced bullying on school property, as well.

But while these facts have received the greatest mainstream media attention, conservative outlets have noted relationship violence among those same-sex-attracted teenagers is far higher than violence among heterosexual teens. About one in six same-sex-attracted teens had been forced into unwanted sexual intercourse, compared to one in 19 heterosexual students.

These and other factors have led to one of the saddest study findings: Enormous rates of depression, attempted suicide, and violence among LGB teens. About 43 percent of LGB teens said they have considered suicide, compared to 15 percent of heterosexual students. Nearly as many LGB teens made a suicide plan, and more than 29 percent actually attempted suicide at least once. Just 6.4 percent of heterosexual students attempted suicide.

See more of the CDC’s study’s results in my longer summary of the study, here.

How to Help These Troubled Kids?

The study’s authors jumped onto mainstream LGBT activists’ bandwagon, saying in their conclusions that “sexual minority students” often “struggle because of the disparities in health-related behaviors documented in this report, particularly violence-related behaviors and alcohol and other drug use, that can be compounded by stigma, discrimination, and homophobia.” Solutions, according to the authors, should include policies promoting “school connectedness and a safe, welcoming, and accepting school environment for all students,” including “gay/straight alliances” and the use of “inclusive words or terms.”

Log Cabin Republicans President Gregory T. Angelo told The Stream that while young Americans generally support the LGBT movement, “A plurality — or even a majority — of support for the LGBT community by young Americans does not mean the next generation is devoid of homophobia or incapable of bullying and violence against their LGBT peers.” Angelo told The Federalist that “We need to look at new approaches to harm reduction in the LGBT community to lower rates of drug use and other unhealthy activities.”

Robert Lopez, an executive board member at the International Children’s Rights Institute who identifies as a chaste bisexual, agreed with Angelo but disagreed about potential solutions.

“Who is the gay pool in the first place?” he asked. “Judging from the data I would suggest that what separates the LGBT from the non-LGBT respondents isn’t actually whether or not they are LGBT, but rather whether or not they are risk-takers, experimenters, or malcontented individuals who have been recruited by the copious outreach programs to attribute all their struggles to sexual orientation.”

Unknown Interplay Between Victimization and Victimhood

A CDC spokesperson told me the agency could not determine whether LGB or heterosexual students initiated the reported bullying. “The survey focuses on students’ behaviors; the survey does not ask students about the source of reported bullying or the other violence measures,” the CDC email response said. “Thus, the survey does not include follow up questions and CDC cannot identify who is initiating the bullying.”

“Additionally, it’s important to point out that while some of the reported dating violence may have occurred with a same-sex partner, some young people who identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual also reported sexual contact with opposite-sex partners. Meaning, the study does not indicate whether the reported dating violence was occurring with a same-sex or opposite-sex partner.”

Citing “other research,” the spokesperson said “risk factors” that may lead to more risk behavior and violence among LGB teens “include social isolation, poor parent-child relationships, previous history of violent victimization and being perceived by others as not masculine or feminine enough. Many of these risk factors in the absence of a supportive environment can place young people at increased risk for violence and drug addiction, as well as other serious negative outcomes such as suicide and depression.”

After examining the study, Catholic University Professor Paul Sullins said in an e-mail that its “main finding is that risky behavior across the board is much more prevalent among LGB youth. They are more likely to engage in risky sex, substance abuse, and violence of all kinds. Less likely to wear seat belts or eat breakfast. More likely to be depressed (feel sad) or attempt suicide.”

“LGB sexual identity or having same-sex partners is positively correlated with almost every risk behavior measured on the survey,” Sullins concluded.

More Corroborating Evidence

This is not the only recent government study on the behaviors of LGB teens. On July 20, the CDC released an examination of how “gay and bisexual teen males” compare to “heterosexual teen males” in sexual practices. The study found that drug use was substantially higher among gay and bisexual males, as was the prevalence of HIV/AIDS.

According to the study, 47 percent of gay and bisexual males had engaged in sexual intercourse, compared to 43 percent of heterosexual males. Just over one-third of gay and bisexual males “were currently sexually active,” compared to 30 percent of heterosexual males. And 15 percent of gay and bisexual males had engaged in intercourse “with four or more partners,” compared to 11 percent of heterosexual males.

One big differential: almost six in 10 heterosexual males used a condom when they last had sex, compared to slightly less than 50 percent of gay and bisexual male teens.

The study concluded, “Despite similar levels of these behaviors, young gay and bisexual males remain at substantially higher risk for HIV infection than heterosexual males, largely because of substantially higher HIV prevalence among their male sexual partners. HIV diagnosis rates are 57 times higher among men who have sex with men (MSM) than among heterosexual men. The higher level of HIV in a sexual network dramatically increases the risk of HIV exposure with every sexual encounter.”

The CDC recommended a variety of strategies to reduce HIV/AIDS among gay and bisexual male teens, none of which were abstaining from sexual activity. This is common with CDC materials about HIV/AIDS prevention, although the CDC does formally recommend abstinence. Earlier this year, a CDC spokesperson told LifeSiteNews that abstinence recommendations would not resonate with people most at risk for HIV/AIDS, saying, “while abstinence is the best way to prevent getting HIV from a sex partner, CDC must address all of the available prevention options to help individuals take control of their health, make informed choices, and reduce their risk for getting and transmitting HIV.”

In comment about the July 20 study, a CDC spokesperson told me, “the estimated per-act probability of acquiring HIV is 3 to 35 times higher (for insertive and receptive partners respectively) for males engaged in unprotected anal sex than for males engaged in unprotected vaginal sex.” Other factors applied, as well.

International Studies Show Similar Results

Higher rates of violence among LGB students is consistent with a 2015 CDC study that found violence in same-sex intimate partner relationships far outweighed that found in heterosexual relationships.

Disproportionate emotional and physical harm characterizes same-sex sexual relationships.

Suicide risk among people in same-sex sexual relationships is not comparatively high just in the United States. A study released in May 2016 examined suicide rates in Sweden, and while it found same-sex “married” women had similar suicide rates as opposite-sex married women, the study’s press release noted that “Among same-sex married men the suicide risk was nearly three-fold greater as compared to different-sex married (IRR 2.895 % CI 1.5–5.5). This holds true also after adjustment for HIV status.”

Concluded the press release, “Even in a country with a comparatively tolerant climate regarding homosexuality such as Sweden, same-sex married individuals evidence a higher risk for suicide than other married individuals.”

Approximately two-thirds of HIV/AIDS-infected persons in America are men who engage in sex with men, although such men are at most 2 percent of the U.S. population. For younger Americans, a graphic released by the CDC based on 2011 data found that more than 90 percent of males aged 13 to 24 who contracted HIV/AIDS did so due to same-sex sexual contact.

The short version is this: Kids can be cruel, and LGB students can be identified and ostracized. But while the CDC tried to spin things in favor of the LGBT activist agenda, its studies show the truth: disproportionate emotional and physical harm characterizes same-sex sexual relationships. Promoting them does a disservice to millions of young Americans.

The Left Needs To Call Off Its Radical Fringe Bent On Destroying Christians,"Ethicist David Gushee’s evolve-or-else warning to religious conservatives about their inevitable clash of orthodoxies with progressives is a sober reminder of the question over what variety of liberalism they will face in the days ahead.

Will a reflexively intolerant progressivism prevail, or is it possible that goodwill, liberal pluralism can frame what happens in American public life as homosexuality and transgenderism become mainstreamed? Like The American Conservative’s Rod Dreher, who has been an online hero documenting the pace of cultural change around American sexual mores, I am pessimistic at the prospect that liberal pluralism will win the day.

That’s not because I think such a pluralism is philosophically impossible or compromise undesirable, but because the intellectual center of progressivism now favors targeting, harassing, and marginalizing dissent about human sexuality. There are few signs that the Left’s aggression toward dissenters will evolve into an atmosphere of mutual respect. On the contrary, all the symptoms suggest the sexual revolution is now in a terminal late-stage progressivism that makes entertaining dissent impossible.

No Magnanimity From the Left

Consider the Human Rights Campaign. As the leader of the gay rights movement in America, HRC can control and frame the debate and rhetoric surrounding LGBT rights—especially in the most elite sectors of American culture, from where it draws its strength and support. There has been absolutely zero magnanimity coming from HRC or Chad Griffin, the organization’s president. The Human Rights Campaign has become a primary incubator for communicating the distortions that the media happily laps up concerning religious liberty.

In its worst forms, HRC creates campaigns that insinuate that anyone dissenting on sexuality is guilty of criminal behavior. Furthermore, Griffin’s Twitter timeline is filled with harsh caricaturing toward institutions or persons that believe in biblically orthodox sexual ethics. In the way that Griffin frames the discussion, there is no goodwill. Everyone who isn’t with him is against him.

This is very significant, because Griffin is arguably the most successful political tactician in America concerning gay rights. His inability to see that there are people of goodwill on opposites of the sexuality debate (even President Obama has said as much) is telling, and has disastrous consequences for the future of American discourse.

Then we also must consider the rhetoric from self-professed “progressive Christians” on LGBT rights. For them, LGBT rights has become, fundamentally, a matter of justice. Not only justice, but a form of justice that calls on the Old Testament prophets for their authority and indignation.

Where justice is at stake, like secular progressives these Christian social justice warriors are adopting the posture that any disagreement on LGBT sexual ethics equals directly harming LGBT people. Consider the words of Brandan Robertson, a young LGBT Christian activist.

When real lives are on the line, there is no longer room for “dialogue”. We must speak loudly, act boldly, and refuse to mince words. — Brandan Robertson (@BrandanJR) September 2, 2016

While I’ll leave to Gresham Machen the debate of whether liberal Christianity at all resembles orthodox Christianity, Robertson’s rhetoric is telling. Only but a few years ago, all that progressive Christians wanted was dialogue around LGBT issues. All they wanted was a seat at the table to be heard. All they desired, we were told, was that evangelicals would adopt a more generous orthodoxy that would make biblical interpretations that affirm homosexuality a viable alternative to traditional readings of the Bible.

But now, with the wind at their backs, gone are the days when “dialogue” was championed as the highest Christian virtue, and here to stay is the ominous ultimatum, admitted by Gushee himself: “Culture warriors who criticize me believe they are defending the True Faith from compromising liberals like me. I believe I am defending the Religion of Jesus from intolerant ideologues like them. We will never, ever agree. Only God can judge.”

Dialogue: Oppression by Other Means

Where has the call for dialogue and debate taken us? Today, in the eyes of both secular and religious progressives, there is no room for debate, because to concede that people can have reasonable disagreement about the morality of LGBT behaviors grants that the traditional or conservative side has legitimate arguments grounded in rationality and plausibility.

This is now unacceptable because granting that religion offers an alternate perspective on the purpose of human sexuality fails to recognize the so-called harm being done to LGBT persons whose very lives are at stake, so such positions must be “stamped out,” to quote influential media personality Josh Barro.

Even progressive Christians’ framing is deeply Orwellian: LGBT Christian advocates like Matthew Vines label those Christians who celebrate LGBT ideology as “affirming” and orthodox Christians as “non-affirming.” It is important not to miss this rhetorical sleight of hand: According to revisionist interpretations of Christian theology, if someone affirms what Holy Scripture, 2,000 years of Christian history, and the unquestioned consensus of moral theologians have all witnessed to, one is now “non-affirming.” Framing the discussion in this manner puts the “non-affirming” category on the defensive.

This type of posturing makes reasoned debate impossible. It is akin to being asked “When did you stop abusing animals?” The question assumes a guilty party.

This is where the conversation is in America on matters of sexuality. It is a tragic state of affairs poised to depict any citizen or institution on the opposite side of the sexual revolution as on the opposite side of justice. Secular progressives and Christian progressives are uniting together in chorus to the sexual revolution’s hymnal. Anyone who fails to catch up is not simply wrong, but violent.

Debate and discussion, we’re told, doesn’t take the lived experiences of LGBT persons seriously, so it cannot be entered into. It is inappropriate, apparently, to ask questions about whether LGBT persons’ unhappiness is caused by external moral shaming, or is an effect of living in an identity that Holy Scripture and moral theologians have deemed immoral and against nature. The Christian moral tradition teaches that sin thwarts human flourishing.

You’re Telling Me Feelings Are the Only Truth

But such framing by progressives is also morally incoherent. To insist that debate about human sexuality and embodiment is prohibited gives moral license to any intuition, experience, or desire a person experiences. This is unsustainable. Why? Because once lived experience is the baseline moral foundation or criteria to deem something moral, it results in a moral relativism that makes it impossible to call any desire immoral or wrong; or worse, to even question the experience as engaging in direct harm. Moral discourse is thus held hostage by progressives who want to control not only the debate, but the language as well.

But what of compromise and pluralism? An ideal compromise or true pluralism would entail the public recognition that individuals can disagree about the telos (ultimate end) of human sexuality without impugning the motives of the other side. This would mean that individuals and institutions that desire to live out the truth of their convictions about sexuality would not target the other side; nor would citizens face government censure.

This is akin to the disagreement over abortion or organizations that supported same-sex marriage before Obergefell. Concerning abortion, since 1973, citizens and institutions have not generally been targeted for believing that abortion is a moral evil despite the federal government legislating otherwise. Laws like the Hyde Amendment recognized that Americans have deep moral division around abortion and targeting any one side would be wrong.

Concerning marriage, prior to Obergefell government never targeted or harassed advocates for same-sex marriage for wishing to overturn that government’s definition of marriage. All that religious conservatives are asking for is the return to a pre-Obergefell environment where believing that men and women are uniquely made for one another is not a thought crime.

Will Anyone Tap the Brakes?

So what’s the point of this? I am under very little illusion that progressives within the LGBT movement will read this and believe, suddenly, that orthodox Christians and the like deserve equal treatment in the public square. But I am hoping that those who have their foot at the accelerator would be willing to tap the brake and ask whether the discourse they are pursuing will result in a long-term gain not just for themselves, but for the millions of Americans who disagree with them and who still occupy the same country.

None of them equate disagreement with the LGBT community as automatic expulsion from polite society.

There are good-faith American liberals. This bears repeating: As a political and theological conservative, I am happy to admit that there are liberals whose commitment to pluralism strengthens society by challenging both themselves and their political opposites to charity and respect. Individuals such as David Blankenhorn and Jonathan Rauch (both of whom I am honored to know as friends) and Andrew Sullivan are the liberals we need at a time like this.

None of them equate disagreement with the LGBT community as automatic expulsion from polite society. Each understands that the Christian moral tradition is woven together by a coherent narrative that sees beauty and intelligibility in its sexual ethics, even if they reject those ethics for themselves. These voices believe religious liberty is something more than a “license to discriminate.” Unfortunately, a cacophony of their own peers is drowning out their voices. A better liberalism must prevail. But will it?

NCAA’s North Carolina Boycott Is Hypocritical Political Posturing,"On Monday, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) announced it will relocate seven national championships from North Carolina because of the state’s now-infamous religious freedom bill, known as House Bill 2, which passed back in March.

The decision, made by the NCAA board of governors, will affect both men’s and women’s championships for tennis, basketball, and soccer amongst other sports, and will deprive the state of the benefits of hosting these major events. In its statement, the board justified the move with its apparent concern for North Carolina’s LGBT citizens—who represent 3.3 percent of the state’s population—adding that the current laws conflict with the NCAA’s commitment to “fairness and inclusion.”

Although the sports organization took issue with many aspects of HB2, foremost on their list of grievances was the fact that under the law, transgender people are legally forbidden from using their preferred locker room and restroom facilities on government-managed property.

Can We Please Call Out The Hypocrisy, Already?

This is not the first time major athletic associations have let political preferences motivate major decisions regarding sporting events. Just this summer, the National Basketball Association (NBA) announced its decision to pull the league’s annual All-Star game from North Carolina in protest of the controversial law. National Football League (NFL) Commissioner Roger Goodell has pledged to fight the bill, exclaiming, “anything that discriminates, we oppose.” All three organizations also exerted considerable pressure on Indiana and Georgia recently, threatening to divert their business when those legislatures were deliberating over similar religious freedom legislation.

Of course, the decisions these powerful organizations make can be chalked up to little more than grandstanding, motivated by a desire to pander to the popular political agenda of the day. They may claim to be concerned about the well-being of transgender folk at their championships, but just as many on their side of issue characterize conservatives’ concerns as “baseless,” so too are theirs.

There have been zero recorded instances of a transgender person being assaulted at any NCAA, NBA, or NFL sporting event. Less than 1 percent of all hate crimes in 2014—the year with the most recent available statistics—were motivated by gender identity. Very few police reports exist regarding assaults on transgender people in locker rooms or bathrooms; indeed, the vast majority of evidence the media uses derives from personal accounts or self-conducted surveys wherein a perceived dirty look constitutes “harassment.” Indeed, it’s quite an irrational fear to assume that hosting a golf match in North Carolina would result in widespread violence towards that state’s transgender population.

There are countless other ways we can perceive the dishonesty in these groups’ commitment to fairness and inclusion for all. The NBA often organizes international basketball matches with teams from other countries, some of which—like Turkey—are far less progressive than the United States on LGBT rights. The NCAA, too, has a long history of hosting bowl games in countries like the Bahamas and Japan, which offer no sexual orientation or gender identity protections. Sports teams also have a well-known, hostile subculture: walk through any professional locker room, and you’ll no doubt hear some players alternate between homophobic slurs and casual sexism.

Given their love of inclusion, why haven’t the NBA or the NCAA pulled their operations in these regressive countries? Why haven’t they worked to eradicate the discrimination present within their own organizations before criticizing legislation passed in civil society?

Dear NCAA, et. al: Stand Up for Women

While the NCAA and other sports leagues trip over themselves to defend special privileges for 0.3 percent of the U.S. population, they’ve evidently forgotten about a much larger and more important demographic: women.

In response to the NCAA’s decision, North Carolina GOP Spokeswoman Kami Mueller released a statement criticizing the organization for its decision, saying “I wish the NCAA was this concerned about women who were raped at Baylor. Perhaps the NCAA should stop with their political peacocking—and instead focus their energies on making sure our nation’s collegiate athletes are safe, both on and off the field.”

Mueller’s statement immediately garnered significant attention, and rightly so, considering that in the very same breath as its rebuke of North Carolina, the NCAA reiterated its commitment to “values of inclusion and gender equity,” as well as its desire to provide ”a safe and respectful environment” at all their events. Let’s take a deeper look into how they’re doing on the whole gender equality and safety stuff, shall we?

Mueller cited a recent case at Baylor University, in which multiple rape survivors accused the college’s administration of deliberately ignoring or mishandling accusations of assault launched against star football players. Baylor is by no means an isolated incident. A large body of literature suggests student athletes commit sexual assault at considerably higher rates than other students on campus. More recently, the case of Brock Turner and the high-profile accusations waged against Jameis Winston in the documentary film “The Hunting Ground” have brought this widespread problem to light. Indeed, researchers are even beginning to analyze the rate at which reports of sexual assault coincide with home and away college football games.

Professional sports leagues like the NBA and the NFL also haven’t lived up to their purported values. The NFL has long been accused of having a “violence against women” problem, thanks to both a large number of domestic abuse cases involving starting players (such as Ray Rice and Greg Hardy), as well as the league’s lax disciplinary rules regarding domestic violence, which have historically been less harsh than drug policy violations. The NBA, meanwhile, has yet to implement a consistent domestic violence policy, and the league has ignored some particularly egregious cases in the past, such as then-rookie J.J. Redick coercing his girlfriend to terminate her pregnancy in 2007 as per their abortion contract.

Again, we have to ask: why should we believe the self-touted “values” of the NCAA and their ilk when they routinely ignore the safety and dignity of women? Why do they jump at the chance to pander to a tiny sliver of the population when they could be doing far more for women—who contribute to their industry as fans, compete under their jurisdiction, and constitute half of the U.S. population?

It’s A Matter of Time Before Trans Goes Pro

Considering the trajectory of the transgender movement, the NCAA may soon come to regret its steadfast support of special preferences and privileges for gender non-conforming Americans. We’ve all heard about the open bathrooms and locker rooms many cities and several states now mandate. But the mania has spread far beyond that frontier, infecting even more civil institutions.

Women’s colleges now accept men who claim to be women. Hundreds of universities now offer “gender-neutral” housing. The Department of Justice has instructed prisons to place inmates based on identity rather than biology. And sports teams from the middle school level up to the Olympic Games now allow biological men to compete in women’s sports and vice versa.

This last policy development is most relevant to these professional sports leagues. The transgender movement has already de-sexed sports at levels both local and international. Why shouldn’t it encompass professional American sports leagues as well? Their exclusion from the golden rule of the trans movement—that identity trumps all—would be completely arbitrary. Indeed, by the NCAA’s own standards, it will have to comply with this inevitable demand.

As Mueller noted in her statement: “I genuinely look forward to the NCAA merging all men’s and women’s teams together as singular, unified, unisex teams. Under the NCAA’s logic, colleges should make cheerleaders and football players share bathrooms, showers, and hotel rooms. This decision is an assault to female athletes across the nation. If you are unwilling to have women’s bathrooms and locker rooms, how do you have a women’s team?”

Acquiescing to and ardently endorsing open locker room policies—as the NCAA has done—signals acceptance of the idea that biology doesn’t matter, that “trans women are women” and “trans men are men.” If this is true in the case of bathrooms, then it must be true in the case of all civil institutions. What leg would the NCAA have to stand on if faced with the prospect of de-sexing their professional teams? How could it reject that demand, yet remain “committed to values of fairness and inclusion?”

Once this happens, how do you think the millions of female athletes will feel? Competing with biological men for a spot on the field would be hard enough—but what about athletic scholarships designed specifically for women? Will anyone self-identifying as “female” be eligible for those as well? If so, underprivileged female athletes who rely on such aid programs will have yet another obstacle to overcome.

If the trans movement continues on its path to professional leagues, it will mean the end of female sports. Women will have no defense against the next biological male who wants to hop in their boxing rings or race them on the track. As a friend and colleague of mine once put it, “when gender identity wins, women and girls always lose.” Let’s hope the NCAA wises up to this fact sooner rather than later.

Stop Stretching The Word ‘Community’ To Mean Everything,"Confused by the presidential candidate who once claimed she was named for an explorer who became famous more than five years after she was born, I checked Merriam-Webster Online for help with the word “community,” a noun I thought I already knew. By confirming my understanding of what a community is, the dictionary only added to my confusion. Then I remembered that language changes over time can be accelerated for ideological reasons.

Any difference between the definition of a word and the way that word shows up in pop culture indicates what’s in play, and “community” is one of the words progressives are trying to change. Hillary Clinton tried that with her crack about half of Donald Trump’s supporters being a “basket of deplorables.” It was a generalization meant to imply community where none exists, then heap scorn on that so-called community for being full of “-ists” and “-phobics” whom Trump has had the poor judgment to “lift up.”

In the old days, people formed communities through proximity, family ties, and shared experience. Eventually, economic growth meant you no longer had to elect amateur politicians into legislatures because there was no shortage of people willing to kiss babies and do each other favors for a living. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot returned to jobs they understood better, and medieval guilds left politics to the professionals. Then community organizers came into their own, with starry-eyed idealists and con artists each learning how to influence politicians.

Sexuality Is Not a Community (Unless You Need Votes)

By highlighting self-interest and sorting people accordingly, you can imply strength in numbers even where there is none. People in power can then turn around and co-opt that energy by mouthing platitudes about how we’re “stronger together,” as long as we’re in the right basket.

Consider the abbreviation “LGBT,” which surfaced in the 1990s when references to the “gay community” seemed incomplete to people who prefer to think of themselves as lesbian, bisexual, or transgender. Because it is so endearingly specific, “LGBT” sounds more welcoming than “gay.” Even so, when LGBT became a free-range abbreviation, it couldn’t keep up with the pack whose big dogs are “NRA,” “AARP,” and “NAACP.”

The problem from a progressive point of view is that biology and psychology are never as forgiving or fluid as activists want them to be. Most people figure that sex is observed and recorded at birth, not determined. With the majority of men and women accepting traditional ideas about sex, LGBT activists needed ways to amplify their own voices, and so added Q (for “questioning”) to the abbreviation they already had. Q covered people unsure of their “sexual orientation and/or gender identity,” as a website called The Welcoming Project puts it.

For strength-in-numbers purposes, the rule is “Once a Q, always a Q.” Activists hope that if confusion over sexual orientation ever morphs into certainty, it does so by moving left within the LGBTQ label into one of the groups allegedly allied with Questioners. Closed systems like that are politically useful, but by making “community” a stealth synonym for “special interest group,” they twist logic, promote conflict, and violate the assumptions on which real communities depend.

The Difference Between a Community and a Special Interest

One way to tell the difference between a real community and a special interest group is to ask which of the two is being bullied by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. If the federal government is gleefully manipulating Section 8 housing money to force demographic change on an area, then people there are part of a real community.

Another way to tell the difference between real communities and fake ones is to ask which seems more hospitable to outsiders. Fake communities cannot afford to be tolerant, because they depend so much on a defining characteristic that anyone who treats that thing as secondary rather than primary seems threatening.

When Hillary Clinton spoke in New York earlier this month, her arrogant dismissal of “deplorable” people got more notice than the fact that she wrapped her scorn in a homey basket metaphor or managed to spout self-canceling nonsense like “I am all that stands between you and the apocalypse” and “I cannot do it alone.” It was “I am woman; hear me roar” and “Help me, Obi-trans-Kenobi, you’re my only hope” in the same speech.

A Midwestern farm kid weighing college options and a Northeastern hedge fund manager nearing retirement probably don’t socialize with each other, but if each of them is gay, they’re automatically expected to patronize gay bars and film festivals. Whether either man fixates on his sexual preference is, for activists, beside the point.

Ironically, the people for whom adjectives like “black” or “transgender” are magic beans that sprout communities wherever they are planted always say that they’re standing up for the dignity of their neighbors. After an officer-involved shooting anywhere in America, for example, someone calls a press conference to say that “the community stands against police brutality.” Nobody this side of Heather Mac Donald remembers that the police say the same thing, and they’re part of the community, too.

Being black or gay or transgender is not enough of a credential to create “community,” because secondary stuff cannot do the work of primary stuff. Real communities share more than one thing. A resident of Florence who cannot see Il Duomo from her living room is no less Florentine than one who has that view. Let’s not let misuse turn “community” into another stick activists use against people who disagree with them.

Social Justice Warriors Define Bigotry Down So They Can Stay In Business,"In 1938, President Franklin Roosevelt founded the March of Dimes to combat polio. You read that right. This piece of trivia is not as widely known anymore, because polio was effectively eradicated in 1955 with the widespread introduction of the Salk vaccine.

So why does the March of Dimes still exist, now as an organization researching, much more famously, birth defects? Put simply, when faced with the prospect of either closing up shop or changing missions, they chose the latter.

An organization changing its mission is hardly surprising. Plenty of foundations and nonprofits whose original purposes or missions have long since been forgotten are still operating. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as an organization that has successfully established itself is likely to be more effective at a new mission. But this phenomenon of organizational self-perpetuation is worth probing. Let’s call it the March of Dimes syndrome.

The March of Dimes Syndrome Writ Large

Now, the basic idea that people or interest groups seek self-perpetuation—we might also call it “continued relevance”—is also nothing new. We are used to thinking of business activity along these lines: in that field the impulse is called planned obsolescence. The idea is that no product should be so desirable or durable that it erases the need for a new product down the road. There is a built-in incentive against a company satisfying its customers too well.

This logic has also often been applied to government, with commentators noting the ease with which lawmakers and bureaucrats start new programs but the difficulty in getting them to end any programs. Milton Friedman’s famous quip that “nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program” neatly encapsulates the idea.

It’s somewhat less familiar to claim this same logic and set of incentives—an organizational impulse to “stay in business” and to never quite solve the problem—applies to the philanthropic (or academic) worlds. But the logic applies here too, and here are a few examples other than the March of Dimes itself.

Pushing Lies about Victimhood

Andrew Sullivan, one of the earliest crusaders for gay marriage and a married gay man himself, has become disaffected by the current LGBT movement, which he accuses of pushing an unjustified narrative of victimhood. He declared at a recent LGBT conference, “These people’s [certain LGBT activists’] lives and careers and incomes depend on the maintenance of discrimination and oppression.”

Although we can argue over Sullivan’s particular claim, the basic idea holds: eliminating LGBT discrimination would in fact essentially render the LGBT movement obsolete. This does not mean, of course, that LGBT activists really want to see more oppression, nor does it mean that all the oppression they claim to see is simply made up. It does mean that the LGBT movement collectively has incentives to remain in existence. Defining where true dedication ends and the March of Dimes syndrome begins is unquestionably a gray area, but it is a gray area that exists.

One way to “stay in business” is to define down the meaning of discrimination or oppression, so words or behaviors that were once mainstream become verboten. That is partly what Sullivan was talking about, and it’s something we can observe in many activist movements, particularly in civil rights and anti-racism.

It is possible to view this cynically: faced with the possibility that racism as previously defined is largely eradicated, the machinery of race activism—the journals, magazines, websites, academic departments, publishing arms, and activist networks—is under quite a strong incentive to remain in business. Changing the definition of racism so enough racism always remains to justify that machinery accomplishes this.

Merchandising Fear and Loathing

It is worth spelling out, quite apart from incentives, just how similar this process looks to marketing or merchandising. Once, racism was understood as an ideology or law that elevated some races over others, usually expressed with anger or violence. Then racism was largely understood as discrimination based upon race, such as job or housing refusals, or hate crimes.

In the 1970s, the definition was changed to focus on society rather than individuals: racial discrepancies were, unless proven otherwise, evidence that the machinery of society operated upon racist principles, regardless of the racial feelings of the individuals involved. That would be “institutional” or “systemic” racism. Today, while that understanding remains, there is even a new kind of racism: microaggressions, or sometimes-unconscious statements that reflect bigotry or discriminatory feelings. It is now increasingly common to claim that racism is actually getting worse, or even that our society is so suffused by racism that it has become permanent.

The actual progression of these ideas would not look any different if the conversation inside the offices of anti-racist magazines/academic departments/activist organizations went something like this (and I am not saying that it does): “Drat—we’ve almost reached racial equality. What do we all do then? Quick, someone come up with a new definition of racism. ‘Built into society, can’t be rooted out’? Great! We’ll never go out of business using that definition!”

Just because an organization or movement exhibits March of Dimes syndrome does not mean the work it does is without value, or that its grievances are without merit. It does not even mean the syndrome is manifesting itself consciously or cynically, as it would be impossible to know.

The point is that there is something other than selfless dedication at work, not only in the business world, but almost everywhere that large networks of people expend great energy and effort toward a common goal. Understanding and recognizing this, far from discrediting such work, will provide it with a necessary moderating and enlightening force. Since the many of the grievances of LGBT Americans, African-Americans, and others are real, that would be an improvement for everyone involved.

"The Media Won’t Pressure Charlotte To Solve The Trans Bathrooms Squabble, But You Can","Things haven’t been the same in North Carolina since Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts, in her selfish desire to be a progressive icon at her city’s expense, decided to legislate against uncomfortable looks in the locker room.

That’s how this whole thing started. A sex offender who once fondled a 15-year-old boy as he slept wanted the rest of society to normalize transgender bathroom trips through legislation, even though transgender people say they were already using whatever bathrooms they wanted. He was the president of Charlotte’s LGBT Chamber of Commerce (as opposed to the straight one) which conducted a survey about discrimination in the city. Spoiler alert: they said they found discrimination! In bathrooms!

(Note: In a poor attempt to defend a sex offender and his movement, Snopes twists the question at hand. It correctly states he is the leader “of opposition to” House Bill 2, but the two items and Breitbart link they post not only don’t make that claim, HB2 wasn’t even written at the time of their creation. So yes, everyone understands he was the leader of the ordinance’s creation, not the HB2 opposition. A Snopes Strawman is the worst.)

The battle, waged largely by celebrities, corporations, and sports conglomerates (isn’t it great when leftists are for the little guy?), has been non-stop since the North Carolina General Assembly stepped in to ensure that men couldn’t share a changing room or bathroom with women in public spaces.

If you haven’t been following this story closely—and other things are going on in Charlotte that deserve the headlines right now—you may have missed the latest twist. In a move that probably should’ve happened months ago, Republicans have said they’ll repeal HB2 if Charlotte repeals its ordinance. After all, there’s no need for a state law about bathrooms until a city comes along and makes a stupid, unnecessary law about bathrooms. We’ll all change clothes, urinate, and defecate like we used to in the good ol’ days.

The Charlotte Chamber of Commerce (the straight one) is on board. The city has a chance to reverse course and help the rest of the state it’s dragged into a national debate, but it refuses. There’s no chance they’ll feel that pressure from the media, so it’s up to the people to take it from here.

It’s On Charlotte, and Charlotte Ain’t Budging

Now sit back and watch the North Carolina media squirm. After months of liberal scolding that seeped from editorials into news and sports coverage, they are at a crossroads. If they truly believe HB2 is harming North Carolina, they should be excited about a possibility to get rid of it. But they care deeply about the optics: the winners and losers.

It would be hard to frame such a development in a way where the winner wouldn’t be Pat McCrory, the first N.C. Republican governor since 1993. McCrory and the Republican-led General Assembly (which took over both houses in 2010 for the first time since 1896) have long been reviled by the media and protested by liberal groups for…okay, I don’t actually know. Maybe the newness of having to work with Republicans for the first time since Grover Cleveland was in office scares them.

The last four years have resulted in the lowest unemployment rate since 2001, a budget deficit that turned into a $445 million surplus, the nation’s fastest-growing economy, raised teacher pay (the last Democrat governor had cut teacher pay, but the liberal N.C. Association of Educators protested McCrory soon after he raised teacher pay) and an end to scandals like those by the previous governor, the governor before her, and a former speaker of the House. But hey, those guys also think you should have a photo ID to vote so, you know. Racism or something.

The loser would be the hyper-liberal Roberts, who loves nothing more than getting LGBT ally awards and making the city seem as “inclusive” as possible. (For a fun game, when someone says the bathroom component of the ordinance is in several cities, ask him to name these cities. Roberts couldn’t.) Roberts could only issue this statement on the new development: “Some people don’t realize there’s no legal reason for Charlotte to do anything, and that’s the point we want to make clear to the community.”

But you knew that already. Rather than initiate this deal on her own, Roberts took the first big domino, the NBA pulling its All-Star Game, like a badge of honor: “All-Star weekend would have provided an excellent opportunity to further showcase our great and welcoming city. Charlotte has shown its commitment to equal rights and inclusion and will continue to promote those values,” Roberts said in a statement. “I appreciate the NBA and our Charlotte Hornets being such strong champions of equality.”

If you read between the lines, you can see other Democrat mayors are either getting annoyed with Roberts, but not wanting to risk the political suicide, or accidentally making our point for us, such as Cary Mayor Harold Weinbrecht and others: “This all began when Charlotte passed an ordinance which would allow people to use bathrooms of the sex they identified with. …. Interestingly, before the Charlotte decision I did not hear of ANY issues related to bathrooms.” I know, right?

Now It’s Mostly About Bathrooms

Charlotte could repeal its ordinance, watch the General Assembly repeal HB2, then work on reinstating the non-bathroom parts of its ordinance. Those parts would no doubt lead to a loss of religious liberty for Christians the next time a gay couple singles out a Christian-run business for a wedding-themed lawsuit.

McCrory has shown a willingness to tweak things, like letting cities set nondiscrimination policies based on “gender identity” and sexual orientation, in his executive order that no one talks about. After all, this is how government works. But Roberts wants the state legislature to put down its weapon first (and last) and allow the ordinance—bathrooms included—to go into effect, forcing private businesses to allow people of both sexes into whatever bathrooms and locker rooms they want.

Although McCrory has shown openness on state and local discrimination policies and the right to sue in state court, Roberts has made no such concessions on the most ridiculous and unpopular part of her ordinance. Alarmingly, she hasn’t had to answer for that.

The media applied all of its pressure on the state’s Republicans, hoping McCrory will lose to challenger Roy Cooper as a result (even if that were to happen, Republicans would probably control both the House and the Senate, making a repeal of HB2 unlikely), instead of their hero in Charlotte. That’s not shocking, because the media picked sides on this long ago.

Questions No One Will Ask If You Don’t

The media will sit back and try to make North Carolina turn blue in November, so take some questioning into your own hands. If the men’s bathroom is such a dangerous place for transgender people, why did Charlotte enact a bill that opens the women’s bathroom to males? Does Roberts not see how this flies in the face of the “rape culture” narrative that she and other progressives push?

What the heck was so wrong with how bathrooms were being handled before?

Can anyone legally define a transgender person? If not, any man could verbally affirm that he were a woman and successfully sue if he were removed from the other side’s bathroom. If Charlotte cannot legally define a transgender person, why are we even bothering with the locker room part of this?

What does Roberts think about religious liberty? Did she write that ordinance with the idea of taking out more Christian wedding photographers? Does she put scare quotes around “religious liberty?”

If Charlotte cannot legally define a transgender person, why are we even bothering with the locker room part of this?

If this issue is killing Republicans, why did McCrory’s poll numbers shoot up to their highest percentages in months after the NCAA and ACC pulled their championship games?

How can the changing room law be both unenforceable and discriminatory?

Why did the Charlotte City Council go forward with the vote and not remove the bathroom component even after the state government told them what would happen?

Is Roberts able to separate an LGBT person’s right to sue in court from rights to go into any bathroom, or are they equal in her sight and inseparable?

This is hurting Charlotte’s economy far more than the state’s, so why wouldn’t Roberts jump at an opportunity to change that?

That last question’s answer is simple: there is no heat on Roberts. In the eyes of the media, she has done no wrong and doesn’t “deserve” any of this. They refuse to see she’s letting her pride prevent fixing the problem she started, or that the state truly doesn’t want a poorly written bathroom law in any of its cities.

If you miss the concerts or sports games coming to North Carolina, even though they don’t affect the state’s economy, or would just like to see this issue go away, pressure the city council, which was reluctant to pass the ordinance in the first place (it failed 5-6 before later passing 7-4 at Roberts’ behest). You can find them here.

The latest twist has made it clear that Roberts can’t be persuaded on bathrooms and the media won’t find that ridiculous. But maybe the folks she dragged along for a ride will.

5 Damning Inconsistencies In Transgender Dogma,"All good parents tells their children: “If you’re gonna lie, you better have a good memory!”

If we bend the truth, we are sure to get caught in contradictions. This is exactly what’s happening with today’s gender theorists, who tell us everything we have traditionally thought about sex difference is wrong. As their made-up theories are tested in real life, the inevitable contradictions come to light in embarrassing ways. Here are only five of the most damning.

1. Gender Is a Spectrum

One of the most basic tenets of gender theory is that genders are like the hues of a rainbow—a vast spectrum of glorious diversity between two extremes of male and female. But it’s not true. You’re attentive when you’re out and about in the world. How many of these other genders have you ever seen? How many can you name?

When I speak on college campuses, I ask males and females to identify themselves by a show of hands. Then I ask those who are some other gender to raise their hands. Only on secular campuses with gender studies departments do folks raise their hands. I ask them to come meet me afterward in hopes that I will have the opportunity to learn something. They are never some new gender, but always some variation of male or female.

Even cultural anthropologists have no names for any other genders outside the binary norm of male or female. Male and female are the only two models nature makes. This leads us to the second inconsistency.

2. Binary Is Bad, But L, G, B, and T Require It

The second most fundamental tenet of gender theory is that binary is very, very bad. But they don’t appreciate that the LGBT construct demands a binary system.

L: What’s a lesbian? A woman who’s attracted to women, not men. The definition demands a binary system.

G: What about being gay? Men who aren’t attracted to the other sex. Binary.

B: What does it mean to be bisexual? This is an easy one. Bi. Bicycle, Binocular, Bifocal, Biracial. Bisexual is binary.

No matter how long the string of letters gets here—and it can get very long—there are no letters describing all the other supposed genders of the rainbow. Thus their own explanatory acronym conflicts with their theory.

T: What is transgender? Identifying with the gender opposite the one you were “assigned” at birth. Gender theory’s trans nomenclature reveals its binarity. Trans people identify themselves as either MTF (male-to-female) or FTM (female-to-male). There are no other options.

The theorists can’t help but have binarity step on their toes at every move in their own effort to overthrow it.

3. Male-Female Is Not Natural, Unless You’re Trans

Gender theory holds that we are male or female merely because our culture dictates two genders and requires us to look and act according to society’s definition of what a male or female is. Male and female are not actually found in nature, they say.

But what if you’re a “trans” man or woman? Consider what the director of GLAAD’s transgender media office said about transgender Caitlyn Jenner: “The world can now see what Caitlyn Jenner has always known, that she is — and always has been — a woman.”

According to gender theorists, only the trans person’s gender is incontestably and irrevocably natural, rooted in the deepest parts of who they are. If we contend that all other males and females are objectively, naturally so, we are unenlightened dolts. If we say that trans male or femaleness is mere illusion, we are bigots and will be severely punished.

What’s more, note that trans people tend to “trans” in extremely gender-stereotypical ways.

4. Androgyny Is Natural

Male and female are not natural, but we are told androgyny absolutely is not only natural but also worth celebrating. But androgyny doesn’t exist without substantive intentional effort. It is a gender construct if there ever was one.

5. My Little Boy Is Actually a Girl

Suppose you’re a school administrator and you have parents who tell you their child is not the little boy he appears to be. They ask you to accept and treat their child as the girl he is and instruct the teachers and students to do the same. If you cooperate, you are a brave, open-minded hero. If you resist, you are evil. This is gender theory orthodoxy. It’s not scientific orthodoxy, though.

Leading researchers working with children with gender identity disorder find that 73 to 98 percent of such children come to identify with their natal sex by puberty. This is precisely why many of the leading scholars and clinicians working with such children recommend parents, pediatricians, and school administrators not facilitate cross-gender behaviors and identity in such children.

One of largest such clinics in Europe is the Amsterdam Gender-Identity Clinic. They hold that avoiding such facilitation in childhood saves these kids “from having to make a complex change back to the role of the natal gender” in later childhood.

Dr. Richard Green, one of the most experienced researchers in this field and a strongly outspoken advocate in LGBT politics, told the Atlantic Monthly that these children will likely feel “a lot of a pressure to remain” as their assumed gender when they start to adjust to their natural gender as puberty approaches. Boys are not born into girls’ bodies, and vice versa. It’s irresponsible and harmful to children to play along with the assumption that they are.

Gender theory is pure ideology. It is not based in any science or logical objectivity. Its proponents literally make it up as they go along, based solely on the way they wish nature were. It’s why their “proper” terminology changes like the weather. Who can keep up with it? It’s why there is no agreement on the LGBT alphabet soup.

It’s all about turning the natural order of gender and sex difference on its head by any means necessary. Like a police detective interrogating a guilty suspect, the more they talk, the more obvious their whopping inconsistencies become.

It’s unforgivable how nearly all of the media, academia, and cultural elites help perpetuate this scam by refusing to ask even the most basic of questions. No detective would keep her job if she were so uninquisitive. It should be the same with journalists and academics who take the gender theorists at their word and shame on anyone who doesn’t.

Psychiatry Professor: ‘Transgenderism’ Is Mass Hysteria Similar To 1980s-Era Junk Science,"Consider the remarkable phenomenon of transgenderism. A disorder of gender identity that afflicts a minuscule number of Americans has become a polarizing cultural cause celebre. Its influence—in capturing public attention and demanding social change—has been extraordinary, out of all proportion to the numbers of the gender-dissatisfied.

While the political left has fully embraced the transgender agenda as a “civil right” opposed by only the bigoted and hateful, many people see the movement as a concerted attack on traditional social mores and customs, an “in your face” assault on conventional standards, practices, and morality.

Clearly, the transgender phenomenon is the tip of the spear of the LGBT movement, greatly energized by the Supreme Court decision on same-sex marriage that includes in the definition of liberty the right of people to “define and express their identity.” For the LGBT movement this literally includes the right to decide one’s gender, to claim the rights of an alternative gender (since gender is malleable, there are choices other than simply male or female), have the choice acknowledged by society as a civil right, and ultimately become accepted as a conventional lifestyle.

However, transgenderism as a normative lifestyle may be a hard sell. While fair-minded people can agree that gays or people with gender confusion should not be discriminated against, the general public doesn’t appear to be ready to accept gender as simply a social construct or that people can be whatever gender they choose. These contentions, the conceptual foundation of transgenderism, fly in the face of reality: the biological difference between the sexes.

The Contagion of Mass Delusion

Transgenderism would refute the natural laws of biology and transmute human nature. The movement’s philosophical foundation qualifies it as a popular delusion similar to the multiple-personality craze, and the widespread “satanic ritual abuse” and “recovered memory” hysterias of the 1980s and ‘90s. These last two involved bizarre accusations of child abuse and resulted in the prosecution and ruined lives of the falsely accused.

Such popular delusions are characterized by a false belief unsupported by any scientific or empirical evidence and have a contagious quality that overrides rational thinking and even common sense. This all-too-human tendency to suspend individual critical judgment and go along with the crowd is greatly facilitated by social media. Most important, however, the cause has received the imprimatur of “experts.” The very people who should know better have bought into the hysteria. Just as “mental health professionals” a generation ago supported the child abuse delusions, and even participated in prosecuting the unjustly accused, so too have they fueled the fire of the transgender delusion.

The transgender movement was greatly energized when The American Psychiatric Association (APA) in its 2013 revised edition of the “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders” (DSM-5) delisted “Gender Identity Disorder” as a psychiatric “disorder,” reclassifying it as “Gender Dysphoria.” However, rather than providing a scientific validation of the transgender agenda, the APA’s action was a remarkable abrogation of professional responsibility in the interest of political correctness.

Unlike medical diseases, psychiatric disorders have no diagnostic biologic markers—no physical findings, laboratory tests, or imaging studies. Psychiatric diagnoses consist of symptom checklists determined by committee consensus. It should come as no surprise that the process is exquisitely reactive to prevailing cultural and political winds. Absent biomarkers that define illnesses, there is no end to the mental and emotional conditions that can be called psychiatric disorders. It can be extremely profitable for an activist special-interest movement to succeed in getting its cause legitimized as a mental disorder, not least for a pharmaceutical industry poised to retarget psychotropic drugs to treat any new mental illness.

Activist Science Plus Relativism Equals Insanity

However, the process works both ways. Psychiatric “disorders” both come and go in response to contemporary cultural fads and determined special interests. For the sexual liberation movement the political advantage lay in having offending disorders removed. In 1973 it succeeded in getting the APA to remove homosexuality from its lexicon of disorders simply by vote of the membership.

The tragedy, of course, is that people suffering from identity issues do not receive the help they need.

Subsequently the movement conflated with postmodern relativism, in which there are no universal or transcendent values, only social and cultural conventions. The doctrine as applied to gender asserts that gender—male or female sex—is merely a social construct, not a biologic fact, and subject to change according to one’s desire. People can be of any gender they choose, an “alternate gender,” or even opt out of the entire gender construct.

Such was the agenda that the APA bought into when it dropped “Gender Identity Disorder” from the DSM-5. However, rather than simply eliminating the concept of gender identity since officially it was no longer a disorder, it created a “new diagnostic class” called “gender dysphoria.” This carried the assault on common sense even further, since now psychiatrists, the purported experts on distinguishing between fantasy and reality, put their stamp of approval on the transgender hysteria.

Only prelogical children and psychotic adults believe in magical thinking, that “wishing can make it so.” Yet “gender dysphoria” is characterized as “gender incongruence:” a feeling of dissatisfaction with one’s “assigned” (birth) gender, and a wish to be otherwise-gendered, makes one a different person. To reclaim one’s true (desired) gender identity may require sex-reassignment surgery, a treatment for the “new diagnostic class” of gender dysphoria sanctioned by the APA. The torturous vocabulary the DSM manufactured to label the possible gender spectrum variations would be laughable were it not so tragic.

Refusing to Diagnose Withholds Needed Treatment

The tragedy, of course, is that people suffering from identity issues do not receive the help they need. Anorexia nervosa is another disorder characterized by a distortion of body image. However, in contrast to the transgendered, who are aided in acting out a delusion with hormones and “sex-reassignment,” people with a morbid and unrealistic perception of themselves as being obese or too heavy are not put on weight-reducing diets. Rather, anorexia is diagnosed as a psychiatric disorder and treated appropriately with psychotherapy.

Anorexia and “gender dysphoria” are among the many manifestations of psychological conflict that may occur during the “identity crisis” of adolescence, an important developmental milestone in identity formation. It is a time of rapid physical changes and strong sexual urges. Gender confusion—the wish to be the opposite sex, or even to be no sex at all (non-gendered)—can simply be a young person’s temporary pause in resolving the conflict between the safety of secure parental attachments and the compelling but frightening urges of adult sexuality and autonomy.

Asceticism—a renunciation of sexuality and sensual pleasures generally, in effect becoming asexual and anhedonic—is another coping device young people sometimes use. It is remarkably similar to gender dysphoria in its purpose of achieving a temporary respite from confusion about one’s emerging sexuality and anxiety about the demands of adulthood.

The vast majority of such defense mechanisms are transient, useful when the storms of adolescence are most intense, but no longer necessary as a more stable sense of self emerges. (Most common perhaps is the adolescent idealization of celebrities. That many of these popular figures are androgynous illustrates the nature of these identifications as a respite from sexual and gender conflict.) Very few young people who diet severely become lifelong anorectics. Not many adolescent ascetics become cloistered monks. In contrast, some gender-dissatisfied youths are given hormones and even undergo sex- reassignment surgery. A transient developmental conflict is subjected to life-changing and sometimes irreversible treatment.

Reinforcing Delusions Hurts People

More lamentable still is the use of these “treatments” in prepubescent children whose prelogical thinking blurs the boundaries between fantasy and reality. Young parents with concerns about their children need to seek the counsel of people with knowledge about normal child development. Unfortunately, good advice is sometimes hard to come by. Afraid of being seen as “behind the times,” “ignorant,” or “bigoted,” people who should know better are unwilling to rely on their own common sense and the wisdom of generations.

Middle-aged men and women who feel dissatisfied with their lives may act out unrealistic romantic fantasies in an attempt to remake themselves.

If a four-year-old girl, who, afraid of being displaced in her parents’ affection by a new baby brother, announces that she is a boy, wise parents do not begin treating her as a boy. They do not assume she is transgendered. Instead, they embrace her and assure her that she is their precious little girl whom they love. Parents who allow prepubescent children to choose whether they want to be male or female have relinquished their role as rational adults, and are themselves in need of psychiatric consultation.

Clearly forming a stable personal identity is a complicated business. For some people it is prolonged, and some never achieve it. While adolescence and young adulthood can be a pivotal time in shaping one’s personal identity, identity is subject to inevitable challenges during the life cycle, as well as to unique individual stressors.

Midlife is a challenging time for many people. Middle-aged men and women who feel dissatisfied with their lives may act out unrealistic romantic fantasies in an attempt to remake themselves. Often this leads to the tragedy of divorce and the destruction of families. The transgender movement has fostered the most unrealistic fantasy imaginable—that one can solve what is always a multidimensional dissatisfaction with one’s self by changing one’s sex.

Why Some People Want to Believe They’re Transgender

The characteristics that define one’s personal identity are the nuclear elements of personality. People with a chronically unstable self-image, poor self-esteem, and an ill-defined sense of self are poorly equipped to deal with the stresses of ordinary life. This group constitutes the vast majority of the self-identified transgendered who undertake the full sex-change regimen of hormone treatment and “sex-reassignment” surgery.

However, most people suffering from such common personality disorders do not focus on gender dissatisfaction as the cause of their global dysfunction and do not regard sex change as the remedy. Why would a few people with a complex and multidimensional disorder of personal identity decide that their problem consists in having been “assigned” the wrong sex? The answer lies both in the nature of the personality disorder itself, and in powerful social, cultural, and political influences.

The LBGT movement has achieved enormous success in exploiting the psychological vulnerabilities of people who lack a coherent sense of self, providing both activist leaders and a “noble” cause with which to identify. Flush with success following the Supreme Court’s same-sex marriage decision, the movement has taken on an aura of invincibility.

The success of the transgender rights crusade, based as it is on the cultural delusion of denying biologic difference between the sexes, would suggest there are no limits to the movement’s goal of reshaping American culture and its institutions. Attaching oneself to such a powerful force can be a heady experience for someone whose self-identity is largely defined by the people and causes with which he or she identifies.

Transgenderism Is Identity Politics

The transgender movement has made clever use of the powerful force of identity politics. Clearly, personal identity, the totality of one’s sense of self, does not consist simply of gender any more than it does of one’s race, ethnicity, religion, or class. Such, however, are the categories upon which identity politics are built. To be politically effective, identity politics depend upon lumping people into groups that obliterate personal identities and characteristics. There are no individuals in identity politics, only amorphous masses of people with a common and defining property, one exploited for a political purpose.

All this is with the credulous support of people and institutions who have succumbed to the contagion of a cultural delusion.

This process exploits differences between people (cultural, social, ethnic, religious, etc.) to build constituencies of the aggrieved, the marginalized, and those led to believe they’re marginalized. They are assured redress of their grievances by a special interest group—commonly a political party that profits at the polls from activating them as a victimized group. The victimized must of course have victimizers, who are vilified as oppressors of the community of aggrieved.

This bitterly polarizing formula casts the “transgendered” as an amorphous lot of hatefully oppressed people. No distinction is made among highly disparate groups of the “gender dysphoric.” As has been described, these range from transient expressions of gender “incongruence” that occur in the normal developmental process, to those that are surface expressions of common life-stage conflicts, and to those more deeply rooted problems of personal identity that are symptomatic of personality disorders.

Ironically, individuals are robbed of their personal identity and become anonymous members of the gender identity community—the “transgendered.” Rather than the individual assessments and personalized psychotherapy that the sufficiently distressed should receive, the remedy is one-size-fits-all. A transgender person can become any gender he or she chooses, or be no gender at all. They can call themselves any names they choose, take hormones, and have their sex surgically “reassigned.” All this is with the credulous support of people and institutions who have succumbed to the contagion of a cultural delusion.

Individuals are further stripped of their personal identity as they become pawns in the broader LGBT agenda. As it has gained judicial and political power, the LGBT goal appears to be no less than full public acceptance of any variety of sexual expression it chooses, with no tolerance for dissent. Transgenderism is the vanguard of the current offensive. The bitter social strife it has fostered indicates the lengths to which the movement will go in destroying the opposition.

Demonizing the Opposition

Who are the opposition? True to identity politics, they are cast as a mob of bigoted haters who would deny the transgendered their basic human rights. There can be no other explanation for why someone might believe that transgenderism defies both reason and the laws of biology.

The liberal mainstream media is chief among the institutions in lock-step with the divisive tactics of identity politics.

The demonized, of course, are those of religious faith. Much of the Western world has become secularized and anti-religious, but a strain of strong religious belief still remains in the United States. These adherents to a code of sexual morality that differs from the LGBT sexual liberation agenda, albeit foundational to the Judeo-Christian value system for millennia, are seen as the last bastion of opposition. Consequently, expressions of sincerely held religious belief are attacked as hateful and bigoted. Believers are mocked as unsophisticated rubes and rednecks, desperately clinging to their guns and religion while resisting the inevitable triumph of rational modernity.

The liberal mainstream media is chief among the institutions in lock-step with the divisive tactics of identity politics. Glowing anecdotal accounts and individual testimonies of people who have had sex-change surgery regularly appear in fawning media reports that support and encourage the transgender craze. Transgendered celebrities in particular are commended, and the person’s preferred gender pronoun always dutifully applied.

Any religious or moral opposition to the movement is reflexively characterized as hateful and discriminatory. Nowhere to be seen are the accounts of disillusionment and depression by those who regret having had surgery. In neglecting compelling clinical evidence and research in support of the common-sense notion that surgery is not a treatment for a psychological disorder, the psychiatric profession is certainly most culpable (although one wonders what has become of responsible reporting and the honored tradition of investigative journalism).

The Long March Through Institutions

Along with the media, the political left has warmly embraced the LGBT movement’s apparent goal to reshape the social fabric and cultural traditions of American life and to reconstruct society to suit its demands. There appears to be no limit to efforts to silence dissenters. Religious believers are being demonized, and many fear even freedom of the pulpit is in jeopardy. There is no hesitation in using courts to impose the will of a tiny minority on the general public, even to the extent of changing the bathroom practices of the entire nation.

The effect the transgender delusion will have on our society and its institutions, including the military, remains to be seen.

Objections of the majority, even on grounds of privacy or to protect young children from premature exposure to sexual issues, are simply ignored. Many of our elite academic institutions willingly comply with efforts to alter our basic language, promoting use of the many neologisms invented to label the new varieties of gender.

The federal government’s decision to allow transgendered people to serve openly in the military, women to serve in combat roles, and eventually to have a fully sexually integrated military, illustrates the extent to which political correctness has triumphed. That men and women in the intense and intimate daily contact military service demands could become a highly effective fighting force, a band not of men and women but of generic soldiers, would prove that gender is simply a social construct. It would also refute the laws of human nature. The belief that men and women will not behave in accordance with their biology is precisely the delusion.

The effect the transgender delusion will have on our society and its institutions, including the military, remains to be seen. In contrast, the destructive influence of identity politics is immediate and very personal for the transgendered. As faceless members of a political special interest group, they are robbed not only of their distinctness as individuals but also of their chance for effective treatment.

The vicissitudes of life—developmental conflicts, life-cycle stressors, personality disorders—that express themselves in gender dissatisfaction or confusion are the same as those that can challenge a secure sense of self and cause emotional distress in anyone. Indeed, such distress is what most commonly causes people to consult psychiatrists and clinical psychologists. People labeled “transgendered” or “gender dysphoric” are no less entitled to individual psychological assessment and personalized counseling or psychotherapy.

Historically, contagious popular delusions that deny common sense and fly in the face of reality eventually run their course. This will likely be the fate of the transgender craze. But before it collapses under its own weight, many people will suffer irreparable harm.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/11/17/psychiatry-professor-transgenderism-mass-hysteria-similar-1980s-era-junk-science/,2016-11-17
Why Liberals’ Coming Fight Over Identity Politics Will Be Ugly,"Progressives have a lot to learn in the wake of Donald Trump’s astounding victory this month, and chief among those lessons may be this: the old ways don’t seem to work anymore. The tried-and-true formula of liberal success served reasonably well throughout the young twenty-first century and quite well throughout much of the second half of the twentieth. Yet this boiling stew of identity politics centering on race, sex, and sexual orientation failed the Democrats at precisely the moment it should have been their Excalibur. If this political playbook cannot win against Trump, of all people, what good could it possibly be?

There is good reason for the Left to consider an alternative way to do politics. They might look into discarding identity politics for something better. But abandoning this political model will almost certainly not be easy. It will, in fact, probably be quite an ugly internecine fight between the more practical wing of the Democratic Party and the more manic, single-minded constituency largely comprised of young liberals.

At The New York Times last week, Columbia University professor Mark Lilla made a case for this “post-identity liberalism,” a politics that would “[appeal] to Americans as Americans and [emphasize] the issues that affect a vast majority of them.” That means no more “war on women” hysteria, no more wild claims that Republicans are going to send black Americans back to the antebellum South, no more screaming that proponents of traditional marriage are morally and functionally equivalent to Nazis. Regarding the “narrower…highly charged” issues, especially “those touching on sexuality and religion,” Lilla writes, this new liberalism “would work quietly, sensitively, and with a proper sense of scale.”

Good idea. But this could prove much more difficult than the optimistic Lilla is willing to concede. After decades of aggressive identity politicking, many if not most liberals—and younger ones in particular—will probably not take kindly to working “quietly” or “sensitively” on these hot-button issues.

Millennials Ain’t Baby Boomers, Ya’ll

Democrats will have to come to grips with the young activist bloc sooner or later. The older generations—Baby Boomers and others—might be amenable to softening the relentless liberal identity game, if only because they can remember a time when things were done differently. But the share of older generations within the voting population is shrinking, and will continue to. As Pew pointed out, 2016 may have been the last election dominated by voters born prior to 1980.

This will be a problem for Democrats looking to soften the party’s approach to identity issues. On questions of “identity,” or what is often broadly termed “social issues,” younger voters are far more liberal than their older counterparts.

Consider, for instance, the millennial position on LGBT rights. Data suggest that overwhelming majorities of young voters favor “LGBT nondiscrimination protections,” while nearly three-quarters of millennials favor re-defining marriage to include same-sex couples. Half of the same demographic believes “gender isn’t limited to male and female.”

Young Americans have embraced the LGBT agenda en masse. Will young progressives go along with a proposal to work “quietly” and “sensitively” regarding these issues? Not likely. Young liberals are markedly fanatical and overbearing about the LGBT agenda. They see it as a choice between progress and something resembling 1920s Mississippi. “It’s not uncommon,” wrote Hunter Schwarz last year, “to see Millennials compare LGBT rights to civil rights struggles of the past, and posting about it can feel like a way to be a part of that tradition — a way to be ‘on the right side of history.’”

My colleague Hans Fiene calls this “Selma Envy,” and it’s probably not going anywhere for a while. A liberalism that tries to tone down the wild rhetoric on gay rights will likely meet stiff resistance from these modern-day wannabe Freedom Riders.

Their Politics Determine Their Views on Religion

Then, too, the notion that younger liberals will be willing to restrain themselves about issues “touching on…religion” is dubious at best. Young voters have opinions on religious institutions that are noticeably more negative than the rest of the population; those low numbers are the result of a favorability decline of about 20 percentage points over the past five years.

This astonishing dip is likely due in no small part to the beating religion has taken in the media over the past half-decade: the contraception debate, the gay marriage debate, and other rancorous public dialogues have targeted churches, and millennials have responded accordingly. Young people do not like religion, and they will probably grow to like it even less as the years go on. If someone comes along and tells them, “Hey, you have to start listening to and respecting these religious people you’ve been taught to despise,” how do you think they will respond?

What about identity issues surrounding race? A poll earlier this year revealed that a majority of young adults 18-30 supports the Black Lives Matter movement; a plurality “strongly” supports it. Many millennials have grown up in a toxic social-media-fueled stew of racial histrionics and paranoia: they have been taught that every police shooting of a black man is a modern-day lynching, every real or imagined “microagression” against an ethnic minority is an act of mini-terrorism, and every criticism of a black president is a hatred-fueled injustice. Knee-jerk beliefs like this are difficult to unlearn, particularly as mainstream liberals in politics and the media have more or less reinforced them for the better part of a decade.

In a practical sense, this means a Democratic Party interested in a kind of subtle rhetorical reform likely has an uphill battle ahead of it. For the most part, American liberals have not raised their sons and daughters to be soft-spoken policy wonks. The dominating progressive posture since at least the year 2000 has been a kind of screaming self-righteous fury mixed with a genuine revulsion of anything that smacks of any kind of conservative bent.

For nearly two decades there has been no “proper sense of scale” among the ranks of American liberalism. Reversing this handicap will be very difficult if not, in the near future, impossible. It will surely only get worse under Trump, a man who seems to confirm all of the wild fever dreams the Left has had about identity politics in recent years.

All this means Lilla, and those who think like him, are too optimistic by half. This is not going to be easy, if even doable. American liberals have built a political apparatus that has, for some time, served them well enough, yet now it seems to have backfired on them in the most spectacular and humiliating fashion possible.

This was supposed to be the year when the Democratic Identity Machine shone. Instead, it failed, with a decisiveness that was almost shocking. It is no wonder that some liberals are calling for a different approach in the years to come. And it will not be surprising when more than a few other liberals refuse to go along with it.

Keep Biological Parents On Birth Certificates Despite LGBT Protests,"Like so many youth before me, I went through an extended phase in young adulthood of wanting nothing to do with my family of origin. So upon graduation, I moved halfway across the country, abandoned family traditions, and did everything I was taught not to. Even when I came home for the holidays, I would standoffishly refuse to sing carols and doze through our annual reading of the Nativity story, thinking rather of what material goods awaited me Christmas morning.

Years later, I’ve come to regret my folly. All the things I was doing, and the people I was doing them with, felt unnatural to me, and like the Prodigal Son I’ve since returned home. Not literally. I still live halfway across the country. But in spirit, I’ve come to embrace the traditions, talents, and wisdom my parents passed down to me.

Now when I go home for Christmas, I bask in the easy comfort of family, of bluegrass and heated competition over board games and meandering philosophical debates, and realize that I’m among my people.

I’m blessed, of course, in that I’m not in any doubt as to who my people are and where I come from. For many, it’s not such a simple equation, and the proliferation of same-sex marriage and adoption, surrogate motherhood, and artificial reproductive technology have muddied the waters significantly.

In response to these issues, the Arkansas Supreme Court recently ruled that for newborn children of lesbian married couples, only the biological mother should be listed on the original birth certificate. The non-biological spouse won’t be listed as a parent. In the majority opinion, Justice Josephine Linker Hart stated:

The question presented in this case does not concern either the right to same-sex marriage or the recognition of that marriage, or the right of a female same-sex spouse to be a parent to the child who was born to her spouse… In the situation involving the female spouse of a biological mother, the female spouse does not have the same biological nexus to the child that the biological mother or the biological father has. It does not violate equal protection to acknowledge basic biological truths.

Predictably, the LGBT left has interpreted this as discrimination against same-sex marriage partners and a refusal to accept the forward march of post-Obergefell history. In doing so, they continue to ignore the very real issues of origin and identity presented by the progressive crusade to redefine family.

‘Parent 1, Where Did I Come From?’

We must first recognize that a birth certificate is precisely that: a legal document of birth, an acknowledgement of a person’s existence and origin. It isn’t some kind of family license, or a token of the state’s approval or lack thereof. Even in cases of adoption, the state maintains an original certificate with the child’s biological parents listed, offering the family an amended certificate for their own use.

This policy reflects a basic truth: it matters where people come from. Long, long ago, I learned in Psych 101 that the “blank slate” theory of human development has been thoroughly debunked. Children are born with the blueprint for their personalities and abilities and preferences built into their genes, 50 percent from each parent. Genetics largely dictate all people’s physical existence, not only their appearance but their strengths and limitations, allergies, or risks for disease or mental illness. For these reasons alone, both the state and individual have an interest in accurate accounting of each person’s origins.

Even beyond such purely practical concerns, people feel a longing to know where they come from, to have that sense of belonging and continuity. It’s an established phenomenon that many who come even from the most loving and stable adoptive homes still seek connection with their biological origins, especially later in life. Without it, they may feel a sense of loss and of being lost.

In cases where parents adopt a child of a different race, it’s generally agreed that they should make some effort maintain the child’s ties to her cultural background, or at the very least, leave that door open. When she asks, “Mommy, daddy, why don’t I look like you?” the adoptive parents should encourage, not suppress, such inquiries.

But why should this be any less true of a child raised by same-sex parents? Once he learns how babies are made, neither a birth certificate nor the most thorough progressive cultural conditioning will be able to answer the perennial question: “Where did I come from?”

Daily I see this longing to connect with one’s origin in my profession, sometimes under tragic circumstances. In my work with the Department of Child Services, I deal regularly with children placed in foster care because their parents were violent, neglectful, drug-addicted, or homeless. By nearly any objective measure, many of these kids would be better off to cut ties with their biological parents completely in favor of adoption.

Yet so often I see children express a palpable yearning to be reunified, even with parents who may have beaten or molested them. In my less composed moments I want to tell them, “You know what? Your parents suck. This adopting couple over here is way better. Why don’t you just make them your parents and go on about your life?” But rarely do the children share these sentiments. We can’t help but reach for our roots.

I don’t want to suggest that everyone feels this same longing, nor do I wish to minimize the real and beautiful bonds between parents and their adopted children. I only mean to emphasize that, as Justice Hart puts it, “basic biological truths” do matter, and it’s entirely fitting for a birth certificate to acknowledge that.

The Exception That Ruins the Rule

There is a potential legal glitch here. The same-sex couples’ argument in this case is based on the law that if a newborn’s mother is married, her husband is automatically listed on the birth certificate as the child’s presumptive father. This remains the case even under those unfortunate circumstances where the husband may not be the biological father. Thus, the dissenting opinion states, legal parentage is established based on matrimony, not biology, and to deny this is an act of discrimination against same-sex married couples.

The trouble with this argument is that in the vast majority of cases, the presumptive and biological fathers are one and the same. Prior to Obergefell, it was quite reasonable to equate the two as a general rule. It would also strain the medical and legal systems (and be offensive to parents) to conduct genetic testing on husbands or dig into a couple’s history every time a child is born. Even in those cases where the husband isn’t the biological father, and the birth certificate becomes a “legal fiction,” at least it’s a work of realistic fiction, and one that may well provide the greatest stability for the child.

Applied to same-sex married couples, this reasoning is turned on its head. We know at least one same-sex parent isn’t the biological one, and can’t pretend otherwise. The couple, the hospital, and the legal system are all aware of this, and eventually the child will put it together, as well. To place two men or two women on a child’s original birth certificate may provide practical convenience and a sense of legitimacy. But it’s also a willful rejection of reality. And reality has a way of catching up to people. We’re not doing these children, or the adults they will become, any favors by lying about their origins on their very document of origin.

This ruling is a victory for children, but a small one. Arkansas is a holdout. Most states have already capitulated to the redefinition of “parent” under law, and for those that haven’t, there are sure to be more legal challenges. The legal framework on family we’ve long taken for granted may not withstand our rapidly changing culture. Lest we be swept away, we must learn to articulate and exemplify our own origins in a way we didn’t need to before, and work hard to preserve them in a less-than-supportive environment. No matter how far we go, it’s never too late to start asking where we come from.

"National Geographic Trans Cover Champions Child Abuse, Junk Science","The National Geographic staff chose a cover story of nine-year-old-boy who says he’s a girl for the January 2017 special issue, entitled “Gender Revolution.” Transgenderism is today’s popular social delusion which, contrary to the publicity surrounding it, affects a miniscule portion of the population.

Young Avery Jackson, whether deliberately or not, is an LGBTQ activist whose image is being used to promote transgender politics and raise money for a transgender house in Kansas. Now National Geographic is participating in the activism by spreading the progressive ideology of fluid genders and providing an easy rallying point for future LGBTQ fundraising campaigns.

The activists’ theory of gender fluidity, or gender spectrum, suggests that God-designated genders of male and female indicated by biology is too limiting. Their theory separates gender from sex and says that gender is determined by how people feel or think, not by the objective evidence of body parts, chromosomes, and other distinct biological markers.

Why is the boy’s picture so disturbing to me? Because, like Avery Jackson, I was a cross-dressing boy at the age of nine. I can tell you that crossdressing a young boy is emotional and psychological child abuse and should be stopped, not celebrated on the cover of magazines. I started wearing female clothing at the age of four. My grandma encouraged me by providing clothing and affirmation over a prolonged period. I was sure I wanted to become a female.

Eventually, I did become a female transgender. I was approved and underwent the full range of hormone therapy and surgeries and legally changed my identity. I lived life as a female, Laura Jensen, for eight years. All too late I realized transgenderism was all “B.S.”—a surgical masquerade to superficially project a change of gender. Like others who elect to live the transgender life, I painfully discovered it was only a temporary fix to deeper pain.

Sexing Up Lies that Lead Children Astray

A cover photo is visually exciting and can persuade young people that male and female gender models are not fixed, when they are. Photos like the one on the cover of National Geographic can encourage a child to question his or her gender and sex and act out accordingly.

Not all boys who cross-dress will develop gender confusion, but disturbing to me is how easily gender distress can become an unwanted reality for unsuspecting children when changing gender is encouraged, nurtured, and celebrated seemingly everywhere. Encouraging boys to cross-dress can encourage various disturbing behaviors and anxieties, such as sexual fetishes and gender confusion.

Young people are told transgender feelings are permanent, immutable, physically deep-seated in the brain, and can never change. That’s simply not true. Anyone past age 25 knows that even very strong feelings can change.

During my time of gender distress, I consulted with the leading gender experts to find relief. I was told that the only way I would ever find peace was to change my gender. Yet me and many other former transgenders have discovered the truth: the peace that comes from changing genders is temporary. Feelings change. At some point, which may take years, reality penetrates the fog and living as a superficial female no longer “feels” right. I hear from transgender people who write, “I feel duped. How can I undo this and return to living in my birth gender?”

Real Journalism and Science Investigates Dissent

If National Geographic truly wanted to explore the complexities of gender change, they would have included stories of people who discovered that living the transgender life was an empty promise. A case in point is that of Alexis (born Robert) Arquette, a transgender pioneer and actor who died last September at the age of 47. Arquette’s decision to stop living as a woman was done silently. A posthumous Hollywood Reporter article tells of Arquette’s struggles:

In 2013, amid increasing health complications, Alexis began presenting herself as a man again, telling Ibrahim [a close friend] that ‘gender is bullshit.’ That ‘putting on a dress doesn’t biologically change anything. Nor does a sex-change.’ She said that ‘sex-reassignment is physically impossible. All you can do is adopt these superficial characteristics but the biology will never change.’

Dr. Richard B. Corradi, a professor of psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, calls transgenderism a “Contagion of Mass Delusion” similar to the hysterias of the 1980s and ‘90s, “junk science” that reinforced hysterical, false stories of satanic ritual abuse and recovered memories.

The very people who should know better have bought into the hysteria. Just as ‘mental health professionals’ a generation ago supported the child abuse delusions, and even participated in prosecuting the unjustly accused, so too have they fueled the fire of the transgender delusion.

National Geographic should know better than to buy into these kinds of hysterias. Susan Goldberg, the editorial director of National Geographic Partners and editor-in-chief of the magazine, is recklessly using the magazine and this child to promote gender questioning and the theory of gender as a spectrum. The magazine cover is designed to change minds and influence gender transition.

National Geographic gives no balanced discussion, magazine cover shot, or special edition for the many people who have been harmed by gender transition when the change failed to resolve our much deeper psychological issues. No mention is made of those who detransitioned, regretted changing genders, or died. The magazine makes no exploration of the many underlying illnesses that can cause the desire to change gender, and the fact that treating these illnesses can alleviate the feelings of gender confusion.

Why Can’t a Woman Be More Like a Man

Goldberg told NBC Out, NBC’s digital portal targeted at LGBT people, that “We wanted to look at how traditional gender roles play out all over the world, but also look into gender as a spectrum.” The young boy’s picture on the cover should spark a national discussion about Goldberg and National Geographic.

In answer to the question “Why did you focus on children—and put one on the cover?” National Geographic staff responded:

The worst thing about being a girl is that you just can’t do things that boys can do,” Tomee War Bonnett, a nine-year-old living on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, told us. This sentiment was expressed by girls worldwide—using different words and in different languages, but bound by the same constraints. We put Avery on the cover because she symbolized a lot of the complex and current conversation occurring around gender.

Let me see if I am understanding correctly. Girls worldwide expressed that the worst thing about being a girl is not being allowed to do the things boys do, and National Geographic decided that a boy who thinks he is a girl is the appropriate symbol of this conversation. It requires amazing mental gymnastics to arrive at this conclusion. Avery, a boy, symbolizes none of the complex conversation about gender constraints girls have expressed worldwide. Using him to illustrate the concerns of biological females is a slap in the face, again elevating male concerns and profiles over theirs.

The Nat Geo staff has conflated the issue of females feeling constrained by being female with a completely unrelated topic: the transgender population experiencing severe distress with gender identity. These are hardly the same issues and definitely don’t have the same impact: females number about 50 percent of the population, while people who identify as transgender number a scarce 0.3 percent of the world’s population, at best.

In tandem with the magazine issue, National Geographic produced a two-hour documentary also called “Gender Revolution,” featuring trans kids and their parents. It completely abandons any pretense of covering male-female gender inequality. Like the special issue of the magazine, the “documentary” is an indoctrination for the activist transgender point of view. It endorses cross-gender affirmation and transition for children to the exclusion of any other less-invasive treatment.

This Is Child Abuse

Studies have shown that childhood gender dysphoria does not inevitably continue into adulthood. An overwhelming 77 to 94 percent of gender dysphoric children do not become adults with gender dysphoria. Given this, it’s social, medical, and psychological malpractice to push young children to lop off or sew on body parts and take highly charged cross-sex hormones that can further destabilize their prepubescent bodies and minds, especially when they are highly likely to regret what grown adults pushed them into before they were able to sort through such life-altering decisions.

It’s distressing to me as a former transgender to see the lopsided media coverage, even outright promotion, presented by what formerly had been a respected, apolitical publication. Imagery has a powerful influence on the minds of children and young adults. Just like the infamous Vanity Fair cover of Olympian Bruce Jenner in women’s clothing, this cover and documentary will cause gender questioning in susceptible individuals and lead them into further heartbreak. I know from my own experience and the experiences of those who write me that gender change is a temporary reprieve that makes authentic healing even more difficult later.

It’s distressing to see male and female binary genders being debased and replaced by gender transition and “gender spectrum,” because I know first-hand that restoration from gender distress begins with acknowledging the truth of biology: only male and female exist, and no one can change from one to the other, no matter how strong the feelings are.

Don’t Be Too Distracted To Miss Trump Kept Obama’s LGBT Privileges,"The chaos of the refugee order. The bombshell of Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court. They are like a flash of direct sunlight to the retina: they fill your eyes with light while distracting your attention and leaving everything else in your field of vision spotted and blurry.

You miss things after such a spectacle. This week many Americans have been so distracted that they barely noticed a massively important piece of news that came out Monday. President Trump has decided to keep a President Obama executive order that established special workplace privileges for LGBT people. The New York Times reports:

…the White House said the president was proud to embrace gay rights. ‘President Trump continues to be respectful and supportive of L.G.B.T.Q. rights, just as he was throughout the election,’ the statement said. ‘The president is proud to have been the first ever G.O.P. nominee to mention the L.G.B.T.Q. community in his nomination acceptance speech, pledging then to protect the community from violence and oppression.’ The decision to keep the order, the statement added, was Mr. Trump’s. It uses stronger language than any Republican president has before in favor of equal legal protections for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, though that is not likely to quiet Mr. Trump’s critics on the left.

To say that this kind of enthusiasm is unusual for a Republican president would be an understatement. Nor does this reflect the attitudes of your average conservative voter. Religious conservatives in particular have expressed concern about this executive order, but not for reasons that their opponents might think.

Religious conservatives are not vying for gays and lesbians to lose work because they identify as gay or lesbian. They oppose these orders because they lack necessary protections for religious liberty. President Obama’s order places an undue burden on the consciences of people and organizations that may not agree with the government’s view of sexuality (for example, a Christian university).

When President Obama issued the order in 2014, the Heritage Institute’s Ryan Anderson contended against it, and for good reason:

Today’s order disregards the consciences and liberties of people of goodwill who happen not to share the government’s opinions about issues of sexuality. All Americans should be free to contract with the government without penalty because of their reasonable beliefs about morally contentious issues. Federal policy on government contracts should not seek to enforce monolithic liberal secularism. Today’s order undermines our nation’s commitment to reasonable pluralism and reasonable diversity. All citizens and the groups they form should be free to exist and participate in relevant government programs according to their reasonable beliefs. The federal government should not use the tax-code and government contracting to reshape civil society on controversial moral issues that have nothing to do with the federal contract at stake.

This Is No Surprise

It is not surprising that the Trump administration is keeping this order. Contrary to conventional wisdom, President Trump has given every indication that he wishes to be LGBT friendly. That is why he gave Peter Thiel a speaking slot at the GOP convention last summer.

It’s also why Joe Scarborough warned religious conservatives last summer that Trump is not a true believer on the issues they care most about. President Trump will support some of the causes of religious conservatives, for political reasons. But his actions on these issues do not necessarily represent his own conviction—which we know historically has been very liberal.

President Trump might issue an executive order providing for religious liberty protections. I hope and pray that happens. But it is already a significant loss that he is willing to speak of LGBT as a protected class—a legal category inherent in sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) laws that have caused problems for religious liberty all over the country.

Does This Foretell Nationwide Religious Discrimination?

When President Obama issued this order, he linked it to congressional efforts to pass an Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), a federal measure that Democrats have introduced repeatedly in Congress but until now has failed to pass. That measure would establish LGBT as a protected class nationwide, and it is clear that President Obama intended to achieve the same result insofar as he could through unilateral executive authority.

That President Trump seems to be willing to use his executive authority to affirm President Obama’s order and to recognize LGBT as a protected class is a very big deal and a major departure for a Republican president. It raises the question whether President Trump would support a federal SOGI law like ENDA—something that activists have been trying to get passed for years. What if President Trump gets a Democratic Congress in 2018 that passes ENDA? Would President sign such a measure or veto it? Such a law would be catastrophic for religious liberty.

Social conservatives need to be on the alert. They need to be aware that the administration may use chaos to distract attention from substantive policy changes that test the allegiance of constituencies that voted for President Trump. This seems particularly relevant to religious conservatives: a constituency that is particularly liable to be targeted with symbolic or substantive moves that obscure additional, and at times more concerning, changes.

I hope the president clarifies his intent in all of this. His endorsement of President Obama’s executive order is not a good sign. Hopefully, it is not an indication of things to come.

LGBT Bullies Think Trump Is Weak. Here’s How He Can Prove Them Wrong,"Liberals are up in arms over a possible executive order from President Donald Trump protecting religious freedom. A draft copy of the executive order was leaked to LGBT groups and liberal media outlets in an attempt to prevent the president from issuing it.

But the president should not cave. He should stand up to the liberal outrage and hostility to ordinary American values that fueled his rise in the first place. The executive order is good, lawful public policy, and it makes good on several promises then-candidate Trump made to his supporters.

Indeed, just this week at the National Prayer Breakfast , Trump pledged, “My administration will do everything in its power to defend and protect religious liberty.” This executive order is the place to start.

Here are some of the things the religious freedom executive order would do:

It tells the entire federal government to respect federal statutes and Supreme Court decisions that make clear the free exercise of religion applies to all people, of all faiths, in all places, and at all times—that it is not merely the freedom to worship.

It notes that religious organizations include all organizations operated by religious principles, not just houses of worship or charities. And it follows the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in saying that religious exercise “includes all aspects of religious observance and practice,” not just those absolutely required by a faith.

It instructs all agencies of the federal government, “to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law,” to reasonably accommodate the religion of federal employees, as required by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

It instructs the secretaries of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury to finally grant relief to the Little Sisters of the Poor and others who weren’t exempted from the Obamacare abortifacient and contraception mandate.

It instructs the secretary of Health and Human Services to ensure that all citizens have the ability to purchase health care plans through Obamacare that do not cover abortion or subsidize plans that do.

It instructs the secretary of Health and Human Services to ensure that the federal government does not discriminate against child welfare providers, such as foster care and adoption services, based on the organization’s religious beliefs.

It adopts the Russell Amendment and instructs all agencies of the federal government to provide protections and exemptions consistent with the Civil Rights Act and Americans with Disabilities Act to all religious organizations that contract with the federal government or receive grants.

It instructs the secretary of the treasury to ensure that it does not revoke nonprofit tax status because a religious organization’s ordinary religious speech deals with politics, or because it speaks or acts on the belief that marriage is the union of husband and wife, that a person’s sex is based on immutable biology, or that life begins at conception.

It instructs all agencies of the federal government to refuse to recognize any decision by a federally recognized accrediting body that revokes or denies accreditation to an organization because of such beliefs.

It instructs all agencies that they may not take adverse action against federal employees, contractors, or grantees because of their speech about marriage outside of their employment, contract, or grant, and that agencies shall reasonably accommodate such beliefs inside of employment, contract, or grant.

This executive order is good policy and entirely lawful. The president has the legal authority to instruct agencies of the federal government to respect the religious liberty rights of all Americans where it can.

To avoid any potential conflicts, the executive order explicitly states that it “shall be carried out … to the extent permitted by law” and that any accommodation must be “reasonable.” With those two clauses alone, the hyperventilating criticisms of the LGBT left are immediately rendered void.

But liberals shouldn’t be concerned in the first place. Opponents to the executive order misrepresent the order by claiming it would repeal an Obama-era executive order elevating LGBT status to a protected class in federal contracts. As bad and unnecessary as President Barack Obama’s order was, this new order does not repeal it. Rather, it protects the religious liberty rights of all Americans in very tailored ways that address problems of today.

It ensures that the government will not discriminate against beliefs that are under assault, and protects religious organizations’ right to maintain their mission and identity in their staffing decisions and programming, while not losing the ability to partner with the government.

The executive order also provides specific protections to undo some of the worst of liberal overreach.

It finally and fully protects Americans from having to violate their consciences under the Obamacare abortifacient and contraception mandate. It protects the ability of all Americans to buy health care that doesn’t cover or subsidize abortion. And it protects all Americans who believe that marriage is the union of husband and wife from federal government penalties or coercion.

These protections take nothing away from anyone—they simply ensure that the public square remains open to all religious voices, even when those voices diverge from the government’s view on contested questions. They protect diversity and pluralism and tolerance.

None of this should be objectionable—which makes you wonder why liberals are objecting, except to continue the denunciation of “deplorables” that offended Americans of good will last year. Trump promised while on the campaign trail that he would defend religious freedom. Now is the time to make good on that promise.

Barronelle Stutzman Shows SOGI Laws Treat Religious People As Racists,"Just as we determine people’s character by assessing their actions, the best way to evaluate the wisdom and purpose of a law is by considering its real-world effects. This month, laws adding sexual orientation to public-accommodation nondiscrimination statutes showed their true colors, and the picture wasn’t pretty.

The Washington Supreme Court punished a 72-year-old grandmother named Barronelle Stutzman for declining to create custom floral arrangements to celebrate a longtime customer’s same-sex wedding. One of the worst parts about the court’s decision is its heavy-handedness: It found Barronelle personally liable and threatens to bankrupt her by requiring that she pay hundreds of thousands of dollars (if not more) to the American Civil Liberties Union attorneys who filed suit against her.

This Isn’t About Serving Gay People

Many proponents of these sexual-orientation laws say they’re needed to ensure that businesses do not turn away customers because they identify as gay. This implies no business owner who serves gays and lesbians will be punished. But Barronelle’s case proves that this isn’t true.

Barronelle happily serves everyone in her community, including LGBT citizens. In fact, she had served Rob Ingersoll—the customer who asked her to create the arrangements for his same-sex wedding—for almost a decade. Barronelle built a friendship with Rob, and even though he has sued and sought to bankrupt her, she continues to love him and wishes him the best to this very day.

Even though Barronelle gladly serves her LGBT neighbors, her opponents insist that she violates the law because she refuses to provide services for same-sex couples who are marrying. It isn’t accurate to say, however, that she refuses to serve those couples. She will sell premade arrangements or unarranged flowers for same-sex couples to use in their weddings. The sticking point for her is being required to use her artistic skills to create custom arrangements that celebrate same-sex marriages.

But according to the Washington Supreme Court’s decision, sexual-orientation laws do not just require business owners like Barronelle to serve same-sex couples who are marrying; creative professionals must actually make artwork (in Barronelle’s case, living sculptures) that celebrate those unions as marriages.

Barronelle’s Beliefs Are ‘in Good Faith’

Worse yet, sexual-orientation laws are designed to harshly affect people like Barronelle. They declare that individuals who distinguish same-sex marriage from man-woman marriage are engaged in a form of unlawful discrimination akin to racist actions, like refusing to provide service for an interracial wedding. They say that those who share Barronelle’s views about marriage—a group that includes millions of Christians, Jews, and Muslims—should be treated like racists and ushered out of public life.

But it’s unfair and dishonest to equate Barronelle to a person who opposes interracial marriage. Indeed, existing Supreme Court case law already recognizes that they are not the same. When the high court struck down bans on interracial marriage in Loving v. Virginia, it said that those laws reflected “invidious” discrimination grounded only in odious notions of “White Supremacy.” In contrast, when the Supreme Court redefined marriage to include same-sex couples in Obergefell v. Hodges, the justices recognized that the belief that marriage is a gender-diverse union of husband and wife is based on “decent and honorable premises” and is held “in good faith by reasonable and sincere people.”

That belief is honorable not only because it is shared by most adherents of the Abrahamic faiths, but also because it is rooted in a biologically based truth about humanity (that every child has a mother and a father) and a laudable social goal (that society should encourage mothers and fathers to jointly raise their children in a stable family unit). Opposition to interracial marriage, however, engrafts racist ideas (that marriages should not be racially diverse) onto the institution of marriage solely for racist ends (to keep people of different races from procreating with each other). Nothing but bigotry permeates that view.

Lest there be any doubt, history proves that there is no comparing these views on marriage. Interracial-marriage bans were an historical aberration. They were unheard of in most places at most times, and even in our country existed only in some states. (For example, six of the 13 original colonies never outlawed interracial marriage). On the other hand, the understanding that marriage is the union of husband and wife has prevailed throughout all of human history until approximately 15 years ago. Its ubiquity spanned the globe and reached across cultures, including cultures that predated or were otherwise unfamiliar with Judeo-Christian beliefs.

Equating Barronelle’s Beliefs to Racist Views Is Unjust

Given the stark differences between these views on marriage, it is wrong for the government to treat their adherents the same. To be sure, the government may restrict many public actions rooted in invidious racism, but the government has no legitimate interest in punishing people who peacefully live out the timeless belief that marriage is a gender-diverse union. By failing to distinguish between these two very different things, sexual-orientation laws are built on a flawed foundation and will continually produce unjust outcomes.

Barronelle’s story is a case in point and shows us what an unjust law looks like. It punishes conscientious individuals who love and serve all people but cannot create art celebrating a particular event, and it punishes them by threatening to strip their life savings and home. It also equates “decent and honorable” beliefs with racism, driving the “reasonable and sincere people” who hold those beliefs to the margins of society.

How many more cases like Barronelle’s will it take until good people from all walks of life begin to speak up and oppose the source of these grave injustices?

The Transgender Bathroom Debate Has Nothing To Do With Bathrooms,"On Monday the Supreme Court announced it was remanding the now-infamous transgender case of Gavin Grimm to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. This comes following President Trump’s decision to reverse the Obama administration’s guidance pushing public schools to let transgender kids to use bathrooms and other private facilities as the sex they identify with.

The media, parents, and the LGBTQ lobby has been up in arms. Amid lawsuits and media blitzes, they claim these children just want to use the bathroom peacefully and quietly. They insist the unisex or separate male and female restrooms students have been using for the last 200 years of public education isn’t enough and is, in fact, insulting to transgender students. This is absurd.

While certainly every student should feel safe in school, groups like the American Civil Liberties Union are parlaying students’ desire for security and acceptance into a political agenda.

What the Hubbub Is All About

Last spring, two midlevel Obama administration bureaucrats issued a letter to every public school district that said the federal government would consider them out of compliance with sex discrimination law known as Title IX if all schools did not allow transgender students to use facilities that match their gender identity. Because it was “guidance” and not a formal “regulation,” the letter did not go through the typical lengthy review process, which includes required public input. Although it didn’t carry the force of law, the New York Times reported this letter “contained the implicit threat: Schools that do not abide by the Obama administration’s interpretation of the law could face lawsuits or a federal loss of aid.”

The Obama administration, armed with specialized attorneys, acted like a pair of amateur surgeons: They took the word “sex” in Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, hacked it open with a sledgehammer, shoved “gender identity” inside, then stapled it back up and handed it to the American public education system, mangled and bleeding. This four-decades-old law had never been interpreted to apply to gender—the social perception of one’s biological sex—until the Obama administration got ahold of it. Its rewrite reversed all related regulations, which had gone through the traditional public comment process, and opposed a plain-text reading of the law itself.

Then the administration sat back and watched as lawsuits on the issue sprang up all over the country. School boards began fighting, parents grew furious, and kids became confused. As became clear, a move to redefine sex as gender is not only a religious, but a legal, nightmare.

It’s such a nightmare, it’s already been struck down by one court. As The Federalist reported in November, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) implemented a dangerous mandate, also last May, that required doctors to “perform gender transition procedures on children even when those procedures may be physically and emotionally harmful to the child.” This was also based on reinterpreting Title IX by exchanging the terms and concepts “sex” and “gender identity.” A few months ago, a Texas court struck this down.

Contrary to the dramatic headlines, Trump didn’t execute an executive order or support a law for or against transgender people. What he did was reverse federal overreach. As the Trump administration’s letter states, the Obama administration “guidance documents do not, however, contain extensive legal analysis or explain how the position is consistent with the express language of Title IX, nor did they undergo any formal public process.”

So the Trump administration struck down an extralegal policy the administration had no power to make in the first place. This decision is about unlimited federal power, not transgender policies. The Obama administration’s action was not only not authorized by law, it contradicted the law. This is just as important as the actual transgender bathroom issue.

As For that Bathroom Issue

Since this point about legality seems to be lost on so many, let’s again review the issue causing such an emotional uproar.

It’s estimated that 0.3 to 0.6 percent of the adult American population are transgender: a person born as a biological male who feels female, or vice versa. So an even smaller percentage are students in public high schools. We’re talking 0.1 to 0.3 percent at best. To put this in perspective, more students—about 2 percent of high school athletes—receive an athletics scholarship for college, according to the National Collegiate Athletic Association.

Although small in number, these students, their parents, and the LGBTQ lobby have a massively outsized effect on everyone else’s privacy and comfort. That headlines blare “Alarmed by Trump, schools protect vulnerable students,” or The New York Times claim the Trump’s letter drop is a “setback” for transgender rights not only misses the legal and separation of powers angle entirely but demonstrates a bizarrely skewed viewpoint: What if it’s not necessarily a setback for transgender rights, but a victory for people who just want to go to the bathroom with—wait for it—people of their same sex?

Three percent of the population struggles with anorexia, a mental disorder that manifests itself via restricting caloric intake to the point of illness or even death. If people struggling with anorexia lobbied for the “right” to make everyone in the high school cafeteria skip lunch with them and were denied, would it be a setback for anorexics or a victory for health and wellness?

But These Kids Just Want Their Rights

The entire Grimm case rested on pretending the Obama administration letter had the force of law. All the Trump administration did was withdraw the letter. Make no mistake: The issue isn’t and never was about where kids can use the bathroom.

.@drmoore I’ve spoken with many parents of trans kids. NONE are using them as “pawns in the culture war.” They just want them safe & loved. — Rachel Held Evans (@rachelheldevans) February 25, 2017

While certainly some people happen to get tangled up in huge lawsuits or landmark Supreme Court decisions without intending to cause a ruckus, suits like these are springing up like landmines in a war zone. Teens can’t file lawsuits and net major media coverage by themselves.

In October last year, magically following right on Obama’s trans mandate, three transgender students sued their Pennsylvania school district “for the district’s implementation of a “sex-specific” policy requiring students to use restrooms that match the sex they were assigned at birth.” Never mind that the kids were seniors and “[a]s an alternative, transgender students also can use a unisex bathroom or the private bathroom in the nurse’s office.”

A Pennsylvania judge appointed by Obama ruled in favor of these teens’ demands, saying requiring people to undress with those of the same genetics and body characteristics “violates their civil rights.” Tell me, if you were in high school and had a problem with an administrative decision at school, would you file a lawsuit? Probably not. If so, would you hire one of the best LGBTQ lawyers in the country to represent you, as these teens did? I wonder how they got that idea, and the money.

In the majority of these lawsuits, schools welcomed trans students to use a unisex or nurse’s facility, attempting to accommodate their desires and those of all the other students in the schools’ care. Does anyone actually believe that kids at the height of hormones, friendship struggles, college prep classes, college applications, ACT/SAT tests, sports, and other extracurricular activities actually care that deeply about where they use the restroom? The issue is about a tiny group of people with a distorted worldview pressing their ideas onto the majority in order to grant legal privileges based on feelings contrary to reality.

The Trump administration de-escalated the situation by rolling it back to the states, where it should be. If the president of the United States influences where high school kids go to the bathroom, where is the line at which federal intervention must stop?

LGBTQ Advocates Demand Trump Gets A Registry Of All Gay Americans,"Imagine a scenario in which the Trump administration called for all Americans to register their sexual preferences with the government. Gay, straight, bi, trans, and every other permutation of sexual desire and identity would be compiled and cross-referenced by government officials. Lying or failing to answer the question would be a violation of federal law, subject to fines. The government would know precisely what is going on in your bedroom, and in the bedrooms of your fellow citizens across the nation.

That sounds like a lefty fever dream, a dystopian vision of Trumpian persecution.

Instead, it is the policy some LGBT advocates are clamoring for and were disappointed not to have received last week. Rather than celebrating the protection of their privacy, the National LGBTQ Taskforce released a press statement condemning the administration’s decision to continue the existing policy of minding their own business.

Do You Really Want Government to Collect This Data?

“We call on President Trump and his Administration to begin collecting sexual orientation and gender identity data on the American Community Survey as soon as possible,” Criminal and Economic Justice Project Director Meghan Maury was quoted as saying, “and urge Congress to conduct oversight hearings to reveal why the Administration made the last-minute decision not to collect data on LGBTQ people.” The decision not to compile a government database of gay people was “another step to deny LGBTQ people freedom, justice, and equity,” she went on to say.

It is a strange sort of freedom, justice, and equality that requires a bureaucrat’s catalog to realize it. Even more so when it requires you, under penalty of law, to exercise it. The census is not optional, and a question about sexual orientation would mandate that people disclose their sexual identity to the United States government—even if they have not disclosed that to anyone else.

For an organization that clearly dislikes and distrusts Donald Trump, the National LGBTQ Taskforce is certainly anxious to give him the personal information of millions of people. Outing yourself, in their view, is not just encouraged: it is required.

As The Government Grows, So Too The Census

“The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct.”

From this one sentence in the Constitution, the census has grown into a massive data-collecting operation. That sentence makes the original purpose of the census clear, even without context. The Constitution creates a House of Representatives that is apportioned by population. The only way to determine that apportionment is to know how many people there are in each state. The only way to do that was a census.

Censuses had a bad reputation in the Old Testament, but they were fairly uncontroversial in early America. Perhaps that is because the census was only minimally intrusive in the citizens’ lives back then. The 1790 census did not even write down everyone’s name, only the head of household. The enumeration was simple: how many people in the household, broken down by age bracket, race, and whether the person was free or enslaved. The slavery question was necessary because of the Constitution’s three-fifths clause, which affected how many representatives were apportioned to each state, but the race and sex questions were superfluous. This was a low-tech census even for its day: until 1830, census takers did not even have standard forms to fill out, so they listed the people in his district however they chose, so long as it answered the basic questions.

As time went on, the census asked more and more of people. By 1850, they started listing everyone by name (other than slaves) and asking about national origin. More family information was added each year. Changing demographics and the American obsession with race also meant that the original categories of white, black, and other soon expanded. In 1890, the high tide of scientific racism, the choices included white, black, mulatto, quadroon, octoroon, Chinese, Japanese, and Indian. The government didn’t just want to know your race; for mixed race people, they want to know the exact percentage of African ancestry you had.

Even before emancipation racial questions were not strictly necessary, but afterward they were completely unneeded. Likewise the questions about citizenship status, marital status, household relationships, and any number of other details. So why include them? One part of the answer must be that the government always wants to know more about the people within its borders. The reasons for this can be good or evil but any government, whether it wants to help its citizens or oppress them, must first know about them.

That sort of information was not readily available in the nation’s early days, which meant the government had to do it itself. That has been a boon to historians and genealogists, who find information in those censuses—now digitized—that they could not otherwise find without sifting through local city and church records that are often inaccessible, when they even still exist.

Our Bureaucracy Already Overflows With Personal Data



That dearth of data no longer prevails today. In modern America, information about the population is everywhere. Businesses want demographic information, and are willing to pay for it. Social scientists will do the same. Genealogists of the future will not need to comb the 2020 Census for clues about their ancestors—evidence of our existence is omnipresent. Not a day goes by without a news story about some new survey or poll. Our nation’s bureaucracy is overflowing with personal information on us, and private sources are full of it, as well.

The census mostly duplicates these information sources. For some, that means we should not bother; for others, it suggests that there is no harm in it. The census itself is undoubtedly constitutional. Indeed, the Constitution requires it, but that only applies to the actual enumeration. The decennial reapportionment of the House requires an actual count of Americans, but it does not require anything beyond that.

What About Personal Privacy?

The problem with including personal information in the census is two-fold. First is the problem of coercion. Pollsters have compiled terabytes of data on the American people, but all of it was gathered through agreement of the parties. No one forces you to answer a poll or survey, or to be truthful if you choose to do so. That can be a problem for survey teams, but it is a benefit to the people. Your right to be left alone is preserved. You do not commit a crime when you hang up on a pollster.

An even larger problem is that, once compiled, the database of personal information represents a powerful tool for a government to use against its populace. For all the Left’s furor during the last election campaign over a “Muslim registry,” the same progressive activists are falling over themselves to give the government a sexuality registry, in addition to the racial registry they already possess. If you do not trust the government (or this administration specifically,) why give them another tool to aid in your persecution?

Most of the world’s nations do not compile the detailed census that the United States does. Even among first-world nations, demanding racial identity data from citizens is not universal. A 2001 Brookings Institution report explains the policy in France, which is very different from our own:

France has intentionally avoided implementing “race-conscious” policies. There are no public policies in France that target benefits or confer recognition on groups defined as races. For many Frenchmen, the very term race sends a shiver running down their spines, since it tends to recall the atrocities of Nazi Germany and the complicity of France’s Vichy regime in deporting Jews to concentration camps. Race is such a taboo term that a 1978 law specifically banned the collection and computerized storage of race-based data without the express consent of the interviewees or a waiver by a state committee. France therefore collects no census or other data on the race (or ethnicity) of its citizens.

We Should Be Wary Of Government Data Collection

That some other country differs from us is not reason alone to make a policy change, but it does show that a similarly advanced society can function without doing things exactly the way we do them. We should think hard about reducing the amount of personal, private data we are compelled to divulge to the government. As Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in the 1977 case of Whalen v. Roe, “[w]e are not unaware of the threat to privacy implicit in the accumulation of vast amounts of personal information in computerized data banks or other massive government files.”

Americans should be free to disclose their private data, but they should never be compelled to disclose it. If we care about our privacy, we should at the very least keep our sexual identities off the census forms. We would do well to cut a bit more than that, and to tell the government to mind its own business.

How 3 Recent Animations Subtly Destroy Kids’ Understanding Of Reality,"There is potential danger with anything coming from mainstream American entertainment, but especially with what is geared towards our children. It is not usually the things that are blatantly offensive that we need to be as concerned with; these are often obvious and easy to work around. Rather, we really need to be aware of the constant indoctrination about what is the norm.

We parents are responsible for the development and training of our children, but often the movies that are made for them present subtle and sometimes not so subtle attempts to transform their hearts and minds towards the Hollywood progressive agenda. This includes pushing LGBT-family propaganda that desires to normalize a destructive and anti-biblical perspective of marriage, family, and self-image onto young children.

This is certainly not new, but many companies have been emboldened by the current culture and political power of the entertainment industry, unfortunately not just in Hollywood but in multiple athletic organizations like the NCAA, NBA, and NFL, as well. Here are a few major productions that demonstrate some of the subtle, yet effective, approaches now influencing our children’s hearts and minds.

You Can Be Anything You Want? How About a Panda

First, LGBT representatives have hailed the recent Oscar-winning film “Zootopia” for its progressive and inclusive message. Some quotes from an LGBT website about the film: “In one bit of LGBT subtext, we learn that, when Nick was a pup, he desperately wanted to belong to a troop of scouts but is shunned and humiliated because he is a fox, and the scouts aren’t tolerant of them.” The author proclaims disdain with the Boy Scouts’ long holdout over not allowing homosexuals into their organization.

This author also recognizes the impact of the film on children. “Zootopia does carry a heavy message about racism, homophobia and hate, but … the directive is cast upon younger viewers in subtle Disney fashion while older ones can appreciate the sophisticated framework. Everyone should take their kids, or xenophobic acquaintances to see this film, $12 is not a lot to pay for a Disney parable on ‘human’ rights.” Zootopia is extremely well-written and quite entertaining. The outward message is often good and has several positive aspects. However, it wraps certain lies around varied truths so they become almost indistinguishable. The underlying theme of the film is that being who you were created to be is either insufficient or just plain wrong.

As I watched, read about, and discussed “Zootopia” with my children, several things struck me. At the very beginning, in a conversation between the main character, Judy, and her parents, the father says, “Judy, you ever wonder how your mom and me got to be so darn happy? … Well, we gave up on our dreams, and we settled.” The whole dialog in this second scene sets up the idea that, if you plan to stay as you were made, then you can have no dreams.

This immediately informs the children watching that not only do their parents not know what is good for them but neither does their creator. A few scenes later, Nick, a sly hustling fox who ends up being Judy’s sidekick, is in an elephant ice cream shop. There is a seemingly young fox dressing as an elephant, and his “father” is proclaiming his son wants to be an elephant when he grows up.

Judy offers some very telling advice to the little fox, “And you, little guy, you want to be an elephant when you grow up? You be an elephant. Because this is Zootopia. Anyone can be anything.” This clearly implies that he is not, nor does he have to be, what he was created to be. There are several suggestions here, but it mostly states (not just for pretend) that a fox can be an elephant, which is the very heart of the transgender issue.

As the movie progresses, it is not insignificant that the predators in the movie can no longer be predators. There are several implications here as well, not the least of which is the inference to Isaiah 11:6: “The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat, and the calf and the lion and the fattened calf together; and a little child shall lead them.” The film is suggesting that we can create a heavenly experience here on earth without needing or following God (or his created order), but instead the “heavenly reality” will come through political and social justice.

At the end of the movie, I also found it interesting that the villain is revealed to be a “lamb” whose primary evil deed is proclaiming that predators are predators by forcing them to be predators. The inference could easily suggest that Christ (the Lamb of God) has an absolute truth which the world views as completely foolish and ultimately evil. This is all done in a masterful way to encourage children to reject the created order and instead create an order for themselves–without ever stating it explicitly.

What You Are Made To Be Depends on How You Feel

The film “Happy Feet” had a similar underlying theme suggesting that you do not have to do what you were created to do. Several years ago, I picked the up the “Happy Feet” DVD for our younger children and was shocked at what it conveyed.

It is a cute and captivating story of an adorable misfit penguin, Mumble, who was not good at singing but loved to dance. The dilemma of Mumble not singing is not a trivial one, as if it were a cultural or personal preference that he should be able to choose, like a job, education, hobby, diet, or appearance. The “song” of the Emperor Penguin was an integral part of their created order in procreation, and this lead directly to a constant anti-religious connotation throughout the film.

The attack on Mumble comes from none other than the elder penguins in charge who are villainized for wanting to protect the created order. The head “pastor” penguin (interestingly named Noah) stands in judgment over the young penguin and rants, “You bring this disorder, this aberration … Have you lost your minds? It is this kind of backsliding that has brought the scarcity upon us.” Other penguins mock the pastor saying, “We are just having fun, harmless fun” and “Can you speak plain penguin, please?” However, Noah continues “preaching” about their god, “You invite him to withhold his bounty. He rules the seasons. He giveth and he can taketh away” (directly referencing Job 1:21).

But it wasn’t sufficient for the movie to make just the church look foolish. The film takes a direct jab at fathers, also. Mumble’s dad joins the chorus of elders and reluctantly tells Mumble, “You must renounce your so-called friends, your peculiar thoughts, your strange ways. If we are devout, sincere in our praise, the fish will return.”

The pastor chimes back in, “Your father speaks wisely. Heed his suffering heart and repent.” Mumble responds to his dad “Don’t ask me to change, Pa, because I can’t.” Then at the end of the movie, the dad relents, “There ain’t been one day, not one day, that I done right by you. You’ll have to forgive me.” The father is only reunited with his son after he acknowledges how wrong he has always been.

The progressive agenda is telling us that a child who says he cannot change should not be asked to change. (Remember, we are not talking about the normal options that all children have as they grow up, but the very order into which they are created.) Instead the child’s new order is simply to be accepted regardless.

The LGBT inferences abound: I was born gay. I am a girl inside a boy’s body. The created order must be changed to accept what I say I can or cannot be. The film never presents the love and compassion of a true Christian pastor, only the disdain for the created order he represents.

Implicit Anti-Family Messages in ‘Beauty and the Beast’

Finally, the new live-action “Beauty and the Beast” shows how the entertainment industry intentionally wants to promote these subtle changes into the norm. A well-balanced review from Ted Baehr says, “This BEAUTY AND THE BEAST has most of the charms and positive messages of the 1991 movie, but they are marred by some annoying, gratuitous politically correct homosexual references that are on the nose, out of place and in your face.”

The whole objective is to make this seemingly insignificant gay behavior part of everyday normal activity which every child just needs to learn to accept.

According to MovieGuide, “The basic story of a daughter who sacrifices herself for her father yet discovers true love by looking past appearances to see the inner beauty and worth remains mostly intact.” However, at the very end of the movie there is a short scene suggesting the normalcy of homosexual behavior. There at the grand ball is LeFou dancing with another gentleman who earlier in the film had been dressed in woman’s clothes. LeFou’s suggestive attraction to men is set up and alluded to on multiple occasions during the movie.

Baehr describes, “When Gaston tells LeFou he intends to marry Belle, LeFou asks, ‘What about us?’ Also, when Gaston admires himself in the mirror, LeFou also admires the reflection, adding that he’s determined to ‘get’ Gaston like Gaston is determined to get Belle.”

Disney has written only a handful of new elements into the movie to make it more progressive. There is no actual homosexual activity or conversation (this would still be too offensive to most parents). However, there is a specific objective to normalize homosexual activity so that, one day very soon, the God-ordained family structure will be so undermined they will be able to promote openly this LGBT agenda to our children. Both the film studios and the LGBT community fully understand what they believe needs to be achieved.

In what has become a controversial interview with Attitude, a gay online magazine, “Beauty and the Beast” director Bill Condon spoke about the film and the scene with LeFou. “LeFou is somebody who, on one day wants to be Gaston and on another day wants to kiss Gaston. He’s confused about what he wants. It’s somebody who’s just realizing that he has these feelings. And Josh (Gad) makes something really subtle and delicious out of it. And that’s what has its payoff at the end, which I don’t want to give away. But it is a nice, exclusively gay moment in a Disney movie.”

The magazine’s editor-in-chief, Matt Cain, commented, “It may have been a long time coming, but this is a watershed moment for Disney.” He continued, “By representing same-sex attraction in this short but explicitly gay scene, the studio is sending out a message that this is normal and natural – and this is a message that will be heard in every country of the world, even countries where it’s still socially unacceptable or even illegal to be gay.”

He added, “It’s only a first step towards creating a cinematic world that reflects the one in which many of us are now proud to live. But it’s a step in the right direction, and I applaud Disney for being brave enough to make it – and in doing so hopefully helping to change attitudes and bring about real social progress.”

After its blockbuster opening weekend, many of the mainstream reviews concluded what’s the big deal? There isn’t any overt homosexual content. However, that is exactly the point; the whole objective is to make this seemingly insignificant gay behavior part of everyday normal activity which every child just needs to learn to accept. Hollywood is seeking to make normal what is abnormal through raising our children on stories that makes these abnormalities appear as normal.

What Parents Should Do

We help determine much of what is produced for our children in Hollywood through the tickets we purchase at the box office. Unlike television, which is predominately dictated by major corporations, we control the primary flow of money with movies, while the corporations control the primary flow of money with television. This simply means that the entertainment industry tends to be more careful in presenting certain agendas in children’s movies than in television.

Whatever activities you choose to let your children enjoy, be aware of what the world is trying to make normal.

The concern here is definitely bigger than just movies. It is also those television shows we watch, the music we listen to, and the books we read. We all need to understand and grapple with the worldview being offered to, even persuading, our children every day.

The following are some key elements that we parents may be able to use when helping our children focus on what they watch, listen to, and read: What is the worldview of the movie, show, song, or book? What is the director, author, or artist saying about his work? What and how are they trying to make you feel and think? Most importantly, how does this all relate to Holy Scripture, and does it call us to faithfulness, or show us the consequence of unfaithfulness? This is not an easy struggle, but it is a worthy and essential one.

Whatever activities you choose to let your children enjoy, be aware of what the world is trying to make normal, and make sure your children are aware of the message they are being given. The greatest lie is always mixed with a lot of truth, then seen as part of the truth. This is exactly what the serpent did to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and exactly what the world seeks to do with our children.

As parents, we should be teaching our children to strive for what is good. Children should always be encouraged to work harder, be kinder, love and serve one another, and be more faithful, while seeking to be the absolute best at who and what they were created to be. If you pay close attention to the films, shows, music, and books that are being made for your children, you will have some great opportunities to instruct and direct them in the truths of the Scripture and the foolishness of this world.

Graduates Of Mike Pence’s Alma Mater Denounce Him,"Vice President Mike Pence graduated from Hanover College in southern Indiana in 1981 with a B.A. in history. Instead of expressing pride in the success of a former grad—a standard form of benign self-promotion—many at the college have spent the last decade distancing it from the prominent Republican governor, and now vice president of the United States. As a graduate of Hanover (class of 2015), I have looked on in dismay as the school largely ignored Pence’s achievements and released statements criticizing him for his actions as governor.

In the latest display of virtue-signaling by denizens of the nation’s higher-education institutions, more than 500 people associated with Hanover College, including approximately 470 alumni, recently sent a letter to Pence, excoriating him for a variety of sins against modern cultural Marxist sensibilities.

In a six-paragraph cri de coeur, the letter-writers state, “We write to you to ask how, as an obviously devout Christian, and after four years of the enlightening liberal arts education we all received at Hanover College, you can participate in the discrimination, racism, xenophobia, and antipathy toward the poor that we see in the actions of the Trump administration.” They later ask, “How is sowing fear and confusion among neighbors a Christian value? Scapegoating others for their differences does not bring glory to God, Mr. Vice President, but it just might bring this nation to ruin.”

Throughout the letter, these alumni and associates criticize Pence for his perfectly ordinary conservative stances, replaying a variety of tired anti-Trump talking points and even getting the facts and context dead wrong on several political incidents. They argue, “[Y]ou are now actively participating in efforts to dismantle health care and other social safety nets for all but the most affluent Americans.” Sen. Rand Paul and the House Conservative Caucus would likely disagree with that laughable assessment.

As it happens, Pence was widely vilified among Indiana conservatives and libertarians for his Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0 increasing health care subsidies for able-bodied, working-age individuals above the poverty line, which they characterized as being Obamacare Medicaid expansion under a pseudonym. The law made more than 300,000 low-income individuals eligible for Medicaid benefits while promoting some personal responsibility among recipients by incorporating small but meaningful co-payments.

Doing What the LGBTQ Lobby Wants Means Hating Them?

After these feverish mischaracterizations of Pence’s health care policies as governor, the letter predictably turns to vilifying Pence for having tepidly supported then reversing a state law that would have allowed Hoosiers to mention religious reasons during court cases involving discrimination claims.

“Those of us who consider ourselves people of faith cannot understand, much less support, oppressing any of God’s children in the name of Christianity,” they write. “Discrimination and exclusion are not values espoused by Jesus Christ.” They then “urge [Pence] to oppose those within your administration who have actively courted the support of white supremacists.” They provide no documentation of these outrageous accusations.

These claims against Pence are in fact entirely disassociated from reality, merely reflecting the fact that Pence signed Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 2015. That bill extended to the state level the protections of the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), which was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Democratic stalwart Chuck Schumer and in the Senate by the late Ted Kennedy, two individuals hardly known for ties to right-wing hate groups or sexual purity campaigns. The federal RFRA passed by a unanimous vote in the House and a resounding 97-3 affirmation in the Senate—and it was signed into law by President Bill Clinton, a person deathly allergic to any form of sexual puritanism.

The purpose of RFRA, and of Indiana’s version, was to restore some small amount of liberty to individuals to possibly protect their ability to act in accord with their religious convictions—a value the Hanover complainers repeatedly claim to support. Evidently, religious freedom is all fine and dandy until somebody declines to bake a cake for somebody.

Both RFRA and the Indiana law were serious attempts to protect the rights of individuals to live out their religious values without imposing those values on others. The question at hand was whether the government of Indiana should force individuals to participate in a same-sex wedding when it violates their consciences, such as requiring a devout Christian to bake a cake or make a pizza for a same-sex wedding. The Hanoverians appear to be so intent on rooting out phantasms of homophobia that they can’t recognize that using government to force individuals into contracts is itself discriminatory and illiberal.

Not only this, but after liberal and big business pressure Pence signed a bill erasing the RFRA protections for a constitutionally protected right to religious exercise and extending preferential legal treatment to LGBTQ people, thereby accomplishing a key policy goal of the LGBTQ lobby. How is doing what the LGBTQ lobby wants anti-gay? The letter writers have staked an incoherent position based on empty talking points instead of reality.

Maybe Read Some History and Philosophy Next Time

The rest of the Hanoverians’ harangue is similarly small-minded. Complaining about the Trump administration’s opposition to illegal immigration, they ask, “How on earth is that a conservative aim of government? How is sowing fear and confusion among neighbors a Christian value?” The Christian philosopher and theologian Thomas Aquinas would surely have found their attitude puzzling: He taught that a Christian’s first duty is to his or her children and the second is to one’s neighbors. Equally unfounded is the Hanoverians’ claim that a president asking government agencies to enforce the laws of the United States is un-Christian.

Contrary to the Hanover letter, Pence’s tenure as governor of Indiana, following on the heels of major reform initiatives by former Republican governor Mitch Daniels, was a good time for the state. Hoosier businesses have the nation’s sixth-lowest state tax burden, and Indiana will have the second-lowest corporate tax rate by 2021. Businesses are flocking to the state.

During Pence’s tenure as governor, unemployment fell to less than 5 percent. By this past February, as the final results of Pence’s tenure in office could be seen, Indiana’s unemployment rate was down to 4.1 percent, well below the national average of 4.7 percent. Like Daniels, Pence has left the state in better shape than it was when he arrived in office.

In ignoring those specific successes and casting vague accusations, the Hanover letter exemplifies the groupthink on contempary college campuses. Once a hallmark of American higher education, the ability to engage in open discourse and disagree civilly has fallen by the wayside in recent decades, replaced by hate and shaming of those who disagree with the ever-changing shibboleths of Marxist political correctness. The Hanoverians’ attack on Pence is another in a long line of unctuous attempts in the academy and elsewhere to suppress centrist and conservative ideas and eliminate open discourse.

Maligning Mike Pence’s Convictions Is Not Fair Debate

The most disturbing aspect of the letter, however, is the writers’ continual questioning of Pence’s devotion to Christian values. To cast doubt on the sincerity of a person’s religious beliefs because his political views are different from one’s own is not rational argumentation; it is an open suggestion to others to indulge in the discredited religious practice of shunning. A person who cannot separate politics from religion clearly has no understanding of either.

In stark contrast with the letter writers’ imposition of a political test on religious purity, Pence has never said a harsh word about those who have taken over his alma mater and attempted to impose a cultural Marxist agenda on a school founded by and still affiliated with the Presbyterian Church. Instead of questioning the vice president’s religious faith, the Hanoverians would do more good by considering the logs in their own eyes and asking any conservatives on the campus how welcome they feel there. In my experience there, these academic leftists have become what they claim to hate most: bullies intent on imposing their will on others and silencing all who disagree.

Also worth noting is that the letter writers did not have the courage to make their names public, instead hiding behind anonymity lest any imperfections of their own lives cast doubt on their qualfications to judge Pence.

It’s important to note that Hanover College has taken no official stance on Pence other than to say that he has brought positive attention to the school through his achievements. However, the Hanover administration has allowed students and faculty members to shout that narrative down and replace it with the kind of demagoguery that has become the de facto official stance of the college, as the press coverage of the letter indicates. Like countless others across the nation, I am ashamed of the illiberal political steamrolling by those associated with my alma mater.

Why Trans Activists Will Destroy Homosexual Rights,"Social justice movements have long succeeded in correcting legitimate political inequities by uniting under a banner of moral progress. As a result, people are often inclined to trust that these movements, led by champions of progressivism, must be happening in response to systematic and indisputable wrongs with a virtuous end goal in mind.

Enter the newest and loudest cause: transgender activism. Beneath the lavish media praise, the trans movement is hiding a litany of self-annihilating logic and regressive attitudes that merit public conversation. Aside from changing language to suit their subjective identity, the push to deny women sex-segregated protections, and the aggressive support for the transitioning of children, the often overlooked reality to this activism is the movement’s blatantly aggressive homophobia.

They claim to fight for “inclusivity,” but in pushing trans ideology, these activists are, either wittingly or unwittingly, actively erasing lesbians, gays, and any legislation intended to protect them. These supposed defenders of gays and lesbians are endangering the people they claim to fight for by selling out the community they call their own.

We Can’t Protect What We Can’t Define

Legislation and social order rely on objective fact for ensuring protection and enforcement. Trans ideology doesn’t play well with this reality. Consider the terms in question.

“Woman” defined as “adult human female; of or denoting the sex that can bear offspring or produce eggs, distinguished biologically by the production of gametes (ova) which can be fertilized by male gametes.”

“Man” defined as “adult human male; of or denoting the sex that produces gametes, especially spermatozoa, with which a female may be fertilized or inseminated to produce offspring.”

Trans activism insists these definitions are faulty while failing to provide an alternative. To them, the only relevant “fact” of identity is what is self-determined. The movement fails to coherently define the sexes because its entire political argument relies on suppressing this question in the first place. In reality, their true standard for being a woman or man is simply a strong “feeling” or “conviction” that you are one.

This relies on defining woman synonymously with femininity, and male synonymously with masculinity. Not only is claiming that gender expression makes an essential comment on biology sexist and regressive, but insulting to the gays and lesbians who have challenged, subverted, and influenced the performance of gender for generations.

Gay and lesbian intellectuals once celebrated the radical critique of gender performance. The pride in being gay was located in the community’s rejection of gender norms while continuing to claim biological distinction, because to do otherwise would mean granting certain manners of dress and behavior as inherently male or female.

It’s impossible to say that biological sex is a social construct without conceding to implicit homophobia. Replacing biological sex with self-determined gender erases lesbians and gays, whose sexuality is defined and protected in recognizing the reality of biological sex.

A “homosexual” is defined as: “a person who is sexually attracted to people of their own sex,” with “sex” defined as: “either of the two main categories (male and female) into which humans and most other living things are divided on the basis of their reproductive functions.” If the biological terms “male” and “female” have no bearing when defining people, what’s the point of defining sexuality?

Lesbian, gay, and bisexual people are erased from LGBT protections without coherent definitions of biological sex. When anyone can identify as a class of people, the law is not only negated but unnecessary, because by trans logic, we can just identify our way out of any and all oppressive structures.

LGBT ‘Community’ Versus the LGB

Perhaps more shocking than the immediate acceptance of a movement based on nothing more than subjective feeling is the speed at which prominent people and institutions within the LGBT “community” are allowing fellow member’s identities to be undermined in order to spare some trans people’s feelings.

Shannon Keating of Buzzfeed suggests we eliminate the word lesbian altogether, arguing: “Against the increasingly colorful backdrop of gender diversity, a binary label like ‘gay’ or ‘lesbian’ starts to feel somewhat stale and stodgy. When there are so many genders out there, is it closed-minded — or worse, harmful and exclusionary — if you identify with a label that implies you’re only attracted to one?”

Now homosexuality, and heterosexuality by extension, is harmful because it is exclusionary? The point of defining sexuality is because it’s exclusionary by nature.

Lesbians have undoubtedly gotten the worst of it. There is a disturbing trend of trans women telling lesbians they should sleep with men lest they be labelled as bigots or called “vagina fetishists” (really).

Riley J. Dennis, a YouTuber and self-proclaimed “lesbian trans woman” (a.k.a. heterosexual male), tells lesbians their “genital preferences are discriminatory,” since they only “prefer” vaginas, and “some women have penises.” His self-important preaching is not only absurd, but dangerously influential to an audience of young, impressionable girls and boys who are being coerced into sex out of fear of being “intolerant” and told their sexuality is nothing more than a product of discriminatory “preferences.” His rants sound less like lessons in acceptance and more like some antiquated form of conversion therapy.

LGBT organizations like the Human Rights Campaign and GLAAD stay silent on this, and even worse, make suggestions like replacing the word vagina with “front-hole.” It’s no surprise that petitions have sprung up, spearheaded by gays and lesbians, demanding that the T be removed from LGBT.

Neither I nor anyone is arguing against the humanity of transgender people, but they don’t get a free pass to redefine the sexuality of gays and lesbians, especially while using the LGB movement and its history to further their own agenda.

Ask No Questions

Dare speak out against the insanity, and so-called “tolerant” liberals are quick to send death threats or yell bigot at the expense of any honest discussion.

A new term has popped up to demonize female opposition: TERF, or “Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist.” Like much of the trans narrative, this word resists a clear definition, but frequently it’s used to categorize any woman with common sense. Meka Beresford of Pink News snidely reduces this opposition:

TERF’s claim that trans women are rapists waiting to happen, that they have mental health issues and that fundamentally they are not women. This level of dehumanisation is morally wrong, and all too similar to the persecution that other minorities such as LGB people have faced in the past. If this sort of discriminatory practice is allowed to exist [in the mainstream] then the society we praise for being accepting will take a turn for the worst.

The argument isn’t that “trans women are rapists waiting to happen” it’s that trans women aren’t women. Saying that they are denies material reality and has dangerous implications worth discussing.

To simultaneously invoke the suffering LGB people have experienced and then dismiss the voices within that community is striking, but trans activists love to conflate their activism with that of the fight for marriage equality. They even go as far as drawing parallels with the civil rights movement.

But tell me: were gays fighting to be recognized as straight to obtain marriage rights? Were black people “identifying” as white in order to be seen as equals? No. They fought for their own laws and protections based on definable terms instead of manipulating terms to deny their own class of people the opportunity to self-actualize. Nevertheless, the trans movement is happy to adopt the struggles of others to justify a cause that simultaneously invalidates those struggles.

Where Do the Oppression Olympics End?

The “who is more oppressed” game is one trans activists have excelled at by arguing a laughable concept: that people born in the “correct body” have “cis privilege.” Assuming that gays and lesbians obtain some sort of privilege for being “cis” is wildly insulting and just plain wrong. Does privilege look like being thrown off roofs to one’s death? Or is privilege found in Chechnya concentration camps, where people are tortured to death for being gay?

Assuming that gays and lesbians obtain some sort of privilege for being ‘cis’ is wildly insulting and just plain wrong.

Instead of fighting the inhumane treatment of gays outside of the west, the top human rights issue for the LGBT community is making sure we don’t hurt feelings of people who dispute the definition of being gay in the first place. Many LGB people who oppose the demands of trans activists frequently wonder who is best served by continuing to advocate, since it’s certainly not gays and lesbians.

In the midst of this hysteria, I ask supporters and trans people alike to face a difficult reality that requires a good hard look at the contradictory and harmful ideas trans activism has built itself upon.

Activism is always noble on paper, but good intentions can be taken advantage of to accomplish harmful ends. To trans activists and those who consider themselves members of the LGBT community: what good is your activism doing? How are you standing up for the rights of LGB persons subject to the death penalty around the world by invalidating the very definition of gay?

There is a way to build a movement behind the rights of the gender dysphoric that recognizes the complexity of the disorder, but the mainstream trans movement only succeeds in endangering, insulting, and erasing the community it has so boldly attached itself to. To that I suggest: Maybe it’s time to rethink your approach.

Trump’s Religious Liberty Order Preserves Unequal Legal Climate,"In 2014, President Barack Obama failed to seize an opportunity to promote true equality when he issued an executive order requiring businesses contracting with the federal government to adopt sexual orientation and gender identity preferences. He had been urged by religious liberty scholars and others to include religious liberty protections consistent with other civil rights laws, but failed to do so.

That failed opportunity has led to recent calls for a new executive order with broad protections for people of faith. The new administration has indicated that the LGBT discrimination order will not be rescinded, and it now appears a new religious liberty order will not be forthcoming.

Instead, the president has issued an order that scolds the IRS about challenging the tax-exempt status of non-profits, including churches, if they speak out on political issues. This order, however, doesn’t address the core religious liberty concerns of people of faith. The president should show bold leadership by issuing an order that both protects religious liberty and points the way toward a real solution to the very real problem of heightened religious liberty conflicts.

This solution is grounded in the principle that the religious liberty of churches, people of faith, and other faith groups and the rights of LGBT individuals can be protected at the same time. There is no reason that protection cannot be extended to all Americans in a spirit of equal accommodation.

Trump Hasn’t Fulfilled His Promises Yet

This renewal of American equality can be accomplished with a new executive order, or an amendment to the previous one, that allows faith-based service providers to reflect their religious missions in their employment policies and provides equivalent protections for religious freedom to those currently provided for LGBT workers, without rescinding the protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity. This order would establish a better approach both in policy and politics than the zero-sum approaches that have typically characterized lawmaking in this area.

In addition to providing balanced protections, this would provide a precedent for needed congressional action on religious freedom. Although federal law provides important protections, in the form of principles for courts to follow in assessing religious liberty claims, what is needed are specific legal rules that ensure churches, faith groups, and individuals of faith can live out their religious commitments without unnecessary interference by government.

This approach would not only protect against direct limits on religious liberty in the form of government penalties, but would also curb indirect limitations created by the potential costs of litigation, even if that litigation would be ultimately successful under current law.

Courts Need Clear Guidance

Importantly, under our current law, religious protections must be extended by court interpretations, which can be mixed. If Congress enacted more specific exemptions, it would provide more consistent results for those seeking protections, results not dependent on the sympathies of the judges who assess their claims.

Congressional action could mean courts would not feel the need or be tempted to make new laws as they sometimes do now. Currently, federal courts are being asked to rewrite our national discrimination laws. At least one appeals court has accepted that invitation, holding that when Congress used the term “sex” in the 1964 Civil Rights Act, it included sexual orientation. (Or, as one of the judges who supported the result more candidly put it, the courts should update what Congress did then.) Of course, in making this ruling, the court did nothing to ameliorate the religious liberty implications of such a decision. Such unbalanced, one-sided decisions are typical when judges take on the role of legislator.

Legislative action allows for both accountable decision-making that ensures balanced and equal consideration of claims that might seem to be in competition, and a policy of accommodation that treats diverse groups evenhandedly. The president ought to take an opportunity the previous administration missed, and use executive action to restore equality and plant the seeds of a real, long-term solution.

Court Rules Company Doesn’t Have To Contradict Owner’s Convictions,"On Friday afternoon, a Kentucky court found that the owner of a T-shirt printing company was not violating anyone’s rights by declining a job that would have required him to print shirts with a message that violates his religious convictions. This ruling is a surprising victory for orthodox U.S. adherents of the world’s two largest religions, who have been increasingly taken to court, usually by an LGBT couple or group, and prosecuted for “discrimination” when choosing not to accept money to violate their convictions.

Blaine Adamson is the owner of Hands on Originals, a T-shirt printing company based in Lexington, Kentucky. In 2012, the Gay and Lesbian Services Organization (GLSO) asked Adamson to print T-shirts that would promote a local gay-pride festival. Citing his faith and conscience, Adamson declined to print the shirts and referred the group to another company that would likely complete the order for the same price. The other company printed the T-shirts for GLSO free of charge.

Still, GLSO filed a complaint with the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Human Rights Commission. Two years later, the commission ruled Adamson was required to print messages on his T-shirts that conflicted with his religious beliefs.

Alliance Defending Freedom, a nonprofit public interest law firm, picked up Adamson’s case and appealed the order to the Fayette Circuit Court, which reversed the commission’s ruling. The commission appealed to the Court of Appeals in Lexington-Fayette Urban County Human Rights Commission v. Hands On Originals. The Kentucky appeals court ruled in Adamson’s favor Friday, finding he is free to decline business based on his religious beliefs, and citing the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Statute as protecting his liberties to live in accordance with his beliefs. The decision will likely be appealed.

A Rare Recent Victory For First Amendment Freedoms

Since so many similar cases have seen rulings in the opposite direction, like when this Colorado court deemed a baker had been unlawfully discriminatory in declining to bake a wedding cake for an LGBT couple, this is a victory for free speech and religious liberty advocates and businesses whose owners wish to remain free of government coercion.

In the appeals court opinion, Chief Judge Joy A. Kramer said Adamson wasn’t discriminatory by refusing to print the T-shirts, due to a couple key facts. She found no evidence that would show Hands On Originals had “refused any individual the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations it offered to everyone else because the individual in question had a specific sexual orientation or gender identity.”

In fact, Adamson regularly does business with and employs people who identify as LGBT. This worked in his favor, with the judge immediately ruling out a violation of Kentucky’s discrimination statute that extends special protections to those who fit legally protected categories.

Not only had Adamson previously refused to print messages with which he disagreed, like shirts promoting violence, sexually explicit videos, and strip clubs, but this policy was clearly stated in writing. LGBT business owners also stood up for Adamson’s right to choose the messages he promotes, a rarity in cases like these.

What This Suggests Going Forward

Luke Goodrich, a deputy general counsel at Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a nonprofit law firm that filed an amicus curiae brief in support of ADF, said in a press release, “It doesn’t matter what the speech is—pro-gay, anti-gay, pro-immigration, anti-immigration—the government can’t force you to print it. That’s the beauty of free speech: It protects everyone.”

In an e-mail, Goodrich told me, “The policy is evidence that HOO is making decisions based on the message of the speech it prints, rather than based on any particular buyer’s status.” This is likely how judges view the distinction between a case like this and the case of the Colorado baker.

In the past, courts involved in similar cases have ruled differently, putting Christians, business owners, and lawyers on alert that the constitutionally protected right to freely exercise one’s religion is in danger. This case suggests a legal distinction, at least to some courts, between being forced to promote or participate in speech that violates a person’s conscience and, as in other cases, participating in specific activities that conflict with a business owner’s conscience.

While it remains to be seen how future cases will play out, this particular case is a clear victory for religious liberty advocates on any side of the political aisle. Jim Campbell, the ADF attorney who argued this case before the appeals court in December of last year, said in a press release the decision is “a victory for all Americans because it reassures us all that, no matter what you believe, the law can’t force you to express a message in conflict with your deepest convictions.”

Human Rights Campaign Is A Major Hypocrite On Trans Bathroom Policies,"Here’s a little thought experiment.

You’ve been asked to rate two major national retailers on their corporate gay friendliness: Target and Walmart. Regardless of your politics and ideology, play along in the spirit of the exercise. Which would you rate higher? Which should be told to try harder? There are fabulous prizes if you get it right, so think carefully.

Click here to see if you won.

Why did every one of you get such an easy question so wrong? Well, the folks at the Human Rights Campaign—the largest, best-funded, and most powerful gay lobby in the world—tell us why in their 2017 Corporate Equality Index. For the last 15 years, the Index has annually judged and reported on leading national and transnational companies, earning gold stars for their pro-LGBT corporate policies.

Not surprising, Target got a two-thumbs-way-up rating from HRC. Of course they did: Big Red stuck its neck out at great financial and reputational cost to open up access to their lady’s bathrooms and changing rooms to any men who might want to enter.

How did Walmart do? Of course, they got gob-smacked for holding firm to essentially the same policy the state of North Carolina held last year. HRC, in this very report, strongly denounces that policy as “discriminatory” and “dangerous” to LGBT people. Despite that, however, Walmart received the same 100 percent gay-friendly rating as Target. Yes, that’s a head scratcher.

How Can Target And Walmart Both Get Perfect Scores?

First, let’s review just what “100 percent” means. One couldn’t have done any better at being gay- and trans-friendly. It means both Target and Walmart equally hit the top, rung the bell, rocked the Casbah on the matter. It means they met every single non-discrimination policy and criteria set out by the HRC.

So, how could Walmart and Target both receive a 100 percent rating while having two very different bathroom and changing room facility policies—not to mention Target’s cherry-on-top gender-neutral toy department? Of course, this is the elephant-in-the-room question, given that degendering bathrooms was unarguably the biggest LGBT beachhead last year.

The answer is simple. HRC didn’t include trans-bathroom access as an essential LGBT right in its corporate index and it never has. Never. The topic only received a brief mention in this year’s entire report and was listed as merely optional. This, given their report explicitly ensures us,

The HRC Foundation continually examines the criteria and gathers input to guide the future of the criteria [for our ratings]: The changing landscape of legal protections for LGBT employees and their families, both federally and from state to state, and Emerging best practices to meet the needs of LGBT employees and ensure that LGBT employees are treated fairly in the workplace.

Trans Bathroom Access Isn’t Yet Considered ‘Best Practice’

This year’s report, and any prior report, does not consider trans-bathroom access to be a “best practice” in treating LGBT employees fairly in the workplace. Should this omission earn them angry rebukes and name-calling from the glitterati? Should they receive boycotts from massive corporations, such as was rained down upon North Carolina? There’s little meaningful difference between North Carolina saying gender neutral bathrooms are not allowed in state-owned buildings, and the biggest gay advocacy group saying they are not really required. HRC is much too careful and sophisticated for this to be a mere oversight.

What’s more, this year’s report has an entire section listing criteria changes and adjustments for coming years’ reports. No bathroom policy is among them. This, despite their boast that “the most significant progress in the [Corporate Equality Index 2017] has been the wide-scale adoption of transgender inclusive initiatives across businesses.”

Seriously? What does it say to trans folks that the “fundamental right” and “personal dignity” of bathroom access we’ve heard so much about was not worthy of inclusion in their “wide-scale” criteria? Insult to injury. The trans community can only feel stiffed once again by HRC.

What if it’s merely an honest oversight? This is certainly possible, given that these things being termed “fundamental human rights” for LGBT people are being created so quick and freely that it’s impossible to keep up with them. Access to transgender surgery has only been presented as a right in the past few years. Our time’s most forward thinking minds—eminent law experts such as Bill and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama—only recently realized that gay marriage was an inherent constitutional right essential for human dignity. HRC seems yet to appreciate the same regarding bathrooms.

But who can really blame them? When an ideology is making things up as it goes along, it’s easy for anyone to get confused.

Illinois Purges Foster Families Who Don’t ‘Facilitate’ Transgenderism,"The science-deniers are running the LGBTQ show over at the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), and dissenters will not be tolerated.

The department’s new “enhanced” policies promoting the “well-being of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer/Questioning (LGBTQ) children and youth in the Department’s care” ratchet in one direction only: encouraging children towards LGBTQ identities. DCFS has drawn a rainbow-colored line in the sand, announcing it “will not tolerate exposing LGBTQ children and youth to staff/providers who are not supportive of children and youths’ right to self-determination of sexual/gender identity.”

Let’s repeat that: the state of Illinois will not tolerate “exposing” the vulnerable children in its care to people who believe human beings are either male or female and cannot “become” the other. No matter that sexual difference is a scientific fact, or that billions of sane people across the world acknowledge it.

Illinois has decreed its own “truth” about the human person and served notice that it will muzzle the speech and religious beliefs of employees, caregivers, professionals, and cooperating agencies who think otherwise. Here’s the story.

Let’s Look at the Policies In Detail

On May 6, 2017, the director of Illinois’ child welfare agency (DCFS), George Sheldon, “signed enhanced department procedures” setting “mandatory minimum standards for LGBTQ children under its authority (See Appendix K in this May 11, 2017 document. Quoted passages in this article are from Appendix K unless otherwise specified).

Of course, everyone supports ensuring the safety and wellbeing of all children, but the devil is in the details. The new DCFS policies are less about safety and wellbeing and more about using state power to “overrule” basic, empirical (and common sense) truths about human beings and to replace them with ideological assertions that validate adult feelings rather than benefit children.

Designed with American Civil Liberties Union assistance, the policies are problematic not only for the vulnerable children in state care but also for the kin, foster families, caseworkers, volunteers, and others trying to assist them. Consider the effects on staff and volunteers, who must pass an ideological test—to see if they are sufficiently “LGBTQ-affirming”— to mentor, serve, or care for the state’s most vulnerable children.

According to the gender guardians at DCFS, all children have a “right to self-determination of gender and sexual orientation,” and individual choices about “sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression” should be viewed as “developmental milestones, not problematic behavior.” The role of adults is simply to “facilitate exploration of any LGBTQ matters through an affirming approach…by being open, non-judgmental, and empathic.”

Thus, when children or adolescents “explore/express a sexual orientation other than heterosexual and/or a gender identity that is different from the child/youth’s sex assigned at birth,” DCFS “staff, providers, and foster parents” must “support and respect” the child’s exploration “without any effort to direct or guide them to any specific outcome for their exploration.”

In other words, all DCFS staff and volunteers must communicate a uniform message to the children and adolescents in their care: it’s perfectly normal to identify as transgender or gender non-conforming, and just as conducive to a child’s wellbeing to be transgender as to identify with one’s actual sex.

For the true believers behind Illinois’ new child welfare policies, the state’s sacred task is to “facilitate” children’s “exploration” of the rainbow-colored, imaginary world of gender-as-you-like-it. Names, pronouns, and body parts are tried on or swapped out like fashion accessories to match the shifting feelings of “gender-fluid” (otherwise known as “confused”) children.

It’s a fantasyland, where gender explorers are championed as brave and authentic, adults genuflect before the mythical wisdom of “trans” children expressing their “true gender selves,” and “transitioning” always brings peace and happiness. If only it were true. The DCFS, however, has kicked truth to the curb in blind fealty to the demands of the LGBTQ adult community.

Human beings are, in fact, either male or female; we differ in reproductive function, bodily structure, and in differential gene expression (for thousands of genes, according to a 2017 Israeli study). One of the great advances in modern medicine has been the development of sex-specific protocols for disease diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. Sexual difference matters. It’s real. And it’s permanent—painful, conflicted feelings notwithstanding.

Tolerance Is So ‘90s

Dissenting voices, such as employees, volunteers, and foster parents who rely on science and common sense, are not welcome in trans utopia. The new DCFS policies warn staff members that they must “[p]rovide supportive and affirming care regardless of one’s personal attitudes, beliefs, preconceptions and/or judgments, if any, surrounding matters of sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.”

If that proves to be a hard swallow, then “[i]ndividuals who have difficulty meeting this standard for personal reasons should seek assistance from supervisors and the LGBTQ Coordinator,” who will be happy to re-educate the noncompliant. Jobs are on the line—staff members will be “disciplined” and risk “discharge” if they “impose personal, organizational or religious beliefs on LGBTQ children, youth and families” or if their “personal beliefs impact the way individual needs of children/youth or families are met.”

In addition to requiring volunteers and staff to abide by the department’s “LGBTQ-affirming” policies, DCFS “will not contract with private agencies” unless the contractor’s policies are “at least as extensive” as DCFS policies, including provisions that the contractor’s employees may face termination for violating LGBTQ policies. By fiat, then, the state’s child welfare agency is a closed shop, populated with closed minds, and intends to keep it that way. No believers in the binary need apply.

Even placement decisions—including placement with “kin or fictive kin”—are subject to an ideological test that measures the caregivers’ “attitudes and beliefs” about sexual orientation and gender identity, and assesses whether they are sufficiently “LGBTQ-affirming”:

If a child or youth is known to be LGBTQ, the caseworker is responsible for determining prior to placement, the caregiver’s attitudes and beliefs regarding sexual orientation, gender identity/gender expression. In no instance should LGBTQ children/youth be placed with a non-affirming caregiver who is opposed to sexual orientations that differ from the caregiver’s own. Nor should LGBTQ children and youth be placed with caregivers who are unwilling/unable to support children and youth whose gender identity or gender expression differs from traditional expectation…If a caregiver is found to be non-affirming or is otherwise in violation of the nondiscrimination requirements in Appendix K, the youth’s DCFS caseworker must take immediate action to intervene and take appropriate corrective action and contact the LGBTQ Coordinator. (302- Appendix K, section e).

Here Comes the LGBTQ Czar to Oversee Kids’ Sexuality

To get everyone on the same trans-pushing page, the new enhanced policies mandate training in “LGBTQ competency” for staff, providers, and foster parents, regardless of whether they currently serve LGBTQ kids:

All DCFS/POS staff, providers and foster parents are required to be culturally competent in serving the needs of LGBTQ children and youth…Therefore, any person who is involved with DCFS children/youth will complete mandatory training in LGBTQ competency. Specifically, LGBTQ training will be part of the retraining Child Welfare license …part of PRIDE training, and …DCFS core training. DCFS and POS staff must complete additional, mandatory standalone LGBTQ training at least once per year. (302- Appendix K, section a)

Partner agencies also must include LGBTQ training for volunteers and employees. “Annual training in LGBTQ competent care is required for all child welfare providers, whether or not they believe they…currently care for any LGBTQ child/youth.” And training will be ongoing throughout the year. It’s LGBTQ indoctrination, early and often, whether you need it or not.

It gets worse. The new policies empower the state’s LGBTQ czar (officially known as the “State LGBTQ Coordinator”) oversee the sexual orientation and gender identity of all children and youth under the state’s care. Every child in the system is given “LGBTQ appropriate” sexual health resources and put through LGBTQ-oriented sexual health education (because any child could be LGBTQ, after all).

Protocols require caseworkers to contact the LGBTQ czar “immediately” about any sexual orientation or gender identity issues involving any child in the system: the LGBTQ coordinator must be notified “whenever questions or concerns surrounding a child or youth’s sexual orientation or gender identity arises, even if the child does not identify as LGBTQ.”

Don’t Tell Mom and Dad

DCFS says that the child’s right to privacy prevents disclosing the child’s sexual orientation or gender identity to anyone, including family members and other staff, unless the child gives permission. But there’s one glaring exception: the state LGBTQ coordinator has an automatic right to meddle and must be notified (Sec. k6.)

When a child is in state care, parents have no say in whether the child will receive puberty blockers or hormone treatments.

Also, according to DCFS policies, the LGBTQ coordinator’s “recommendations” on matters related to a child’s sexual orientation or gender identity must be implemented by the staff within five days of the consultation unless an extension is requested. In addition, where caseworkers perceive a risk of emotional or physical harm to an LGBTQ child because of others’ “bias,” they must contact the LGBTQ czar and consider “prompt removal” of the child from that placement. The LGBTQ coordinator is also charged with providing “training and resources” to caregivers and providers “anytime gender or sexual orientation matters are identified.”

State policies also require staff to consult the LGBTQ czar for referrals related to a child’s mental health or medical issues related to “gender transition.” These referrals funnel children towards professionals who are on board with gender ideology: mental health referrals only go to professionals “experienced in serving LGBTQ youth” and medical referrals for “transgender medical care [puberty-blockers/hormone therapy]” only go to professionals “who are recognized as medically competent in the care of transgender child[ren]/youth.”

When a child is in state care, parents have no say in whether the child will receive puberty blockers or hormone treatments, as long as two physicians, or a physician and a counselor “who is culturally competent in transgender health care,” sign off. If a child’s “permanency goal” is to return home to the care of his parents, then the state will notify the parents that hormone therapy is being initiated, but parental permission is not required.

The DCFS policies cover other situations for LGBTQ-identified youth, including overnight housing (according to gender identity), body searches on transgender youth (only “cross-gender” personnel, meaning same-sex, are permitted to conduct searches), and gender expression in secure facilities or group care situations (child’s gender expression should be accommodated).

The Joys of Bountiful Plaintiffs

Finally, the DCFS policies require that all LGBTQ children and youth be informed of their “rights” to self-determination in sexual orientation and gender identity, to be free from harassment and “discrimination,” and to have their “service needs” met. Further, if they encounter problems, they are “advised to contact the LGBTQ Coordinator along with the DCFS or POS Administrator for assistance. Children and youth also have the right to contact their Guardian Ad Litem, Lambda Legal, or the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).”

Not only do these policies encourage a litigious mindset (at least among ACLU attorneys and professional youth “advocates”), they also exert a chilling effect on DCFS staff, volunteers, foster parents, and others whose “speech and behavior” will be monitored and evaluated according to ideological criteria by the state of Illinois.

Forget the democratic process. Forget free speech, freedom of religion, and the conscience rights of American citizens. Forget the welfare of vulnerable children. The state of Illinois heels to the commands of LGBTQ activists; it has embraced a new creed based on the LGBTQ vision of the human person. The only winners are progressive activists and lawyers eager to fill their litigation dockets. The losers? Illinois’ most vulnerable children.

"Katy Tur’s Trans Father Attacked Her Online, And It Was Revealing","In a revealing moment of LGBT social media, transgender activist Zoey Tur publicly raked his daughter over the coals after the Sunday New York Times ran a profile of NBC journalist Katy Tur in anticipation of her new book hitting stores. For the unfamiliar, Zoey Tur is a former news helicopter pilot who has found a bit of celebrity as a recently forged woman who threatened writer Ben Shapiro with physical violence on national TV.

In the profile, Katy Tur hardly discussed her father, a rare moment for The New York Times, which has served as support central for all things transgender. Tur senior’s reaction was self-absorbed and vicious. He said:

When I came out in May have 2013 I told TMZ’s Harvey Levin and National Public Radio I was done running, hiding and I would be open and honest. No one would put me back in the closet. I broke that pledge and I’ve out of integrity. I apologize. My daughter Katy said she’s ‘terrified’ to meet me. She told me the day My x GF Carrie Fisher died that she was going to ‘set things right’ and come see me. That was 171 days ago. Her promise was a whole lot a nuthin. It’s been 1,500 days since she last saw me and told me I was a terrible father after having jv bust comeout. I was crushed. On June 8th a turned 57 and no call-not even an email. On Pride Sunday the NYTimes published a story about Katy that left me humiliated. The timing and optics couldn’t be worse.Truth is my daughter does not support the LGBT community. She’s Transphobic and fearful that it will hurt her career as a broadcaster in these alt-right times putting career before family. In the words of Paddy Chayefsky: She’s pure television. I apologize to you all and will continue to fight for my community. Happy Pride 2017 and Resist!

Let’s unpack that. Tur’s first psychological manipulation is to position himself as a fighter for a righteous cause. Yet believing Tur’s indictment of his daughter depends on willingly suspending disbelief. The claim that a liberal journalist is afraid of being pro-LGBT because that will hurt her career is absurd.

The logic is not without more contradictions. Tur, a 57-year-old father, is an authentic, honest woman, but his daughter is a TV phony. His daughter has a different account that the Times touches on.

Tur’s basic gaslight is to feign victimhood and question his daughter’s honesty. His narcissistic injury: His daughter does not want to see him. His life is hard. He “came out” on the radio. He had a birthday. He was humiliated.

Resist What? Material Reality?

Family is not a political postmodern ideology that needs to check in with LGBT. Many adult children of LGBT parents agree that society has not begun to fully recognize the inherent risks of injury to children because the media and academic “allies” are dedicated to keeping it hidden.

Another way to see what I am describing with the LGBT community and gauge the wider awareness is to look at the reactions to Tur’s post. The reactions of commenters were mixed although more tended toward this response: “You are so brave. You did what you had to do to live a truthful existence. I believe she will come around. I’m sorry you don’t have her in your life now…it’s heartbreaking…”

Some commenters had direct and visceral reactions.

Maybe your daughter doesn’t speak to you because you’re toxic and dysfunctional, as evidenced by this post dragging your family disputes before the public and causing problems for your daughter. You seem like a real piece of work; if I were your daughter I wouldn’t talk to you either and that has nothing to do with transphobia. You sound like you’re making excuses for your poor parenting. Team Katy all the way.

Social media may not be a 100 percent accurate reflection of what the wider population thinks, but it can’t be any more off the mark than rigged polls, fabricated statistics, and fake studies LGBT activists produce and feed to a gullible media. Comments like: “fight on and if you need back up feel free to contact me I am there for you” were not rare.

Why Zoey Tur Made This Public

One rare commentator posed a valid question that cuts to the core of the ideology: “Why take it public. It is between you two.” Here’s why. Simply put, public is where the mob is easily rallied and the victim made a target. It is where the narrative is constructed. This is very important, since public shaming and discrediting is followed by isolating a person. It is one of the main strategies of this movement.

Crowdsourcing abuse in the LGBT community is a common method to control and harm others, including family members and their own kids. With the Internet, people can see it with their own eyes. Increasingly, the hallmark of the gender identity movement is the threat of violence, even more than the standard threats of career, social, and financial harm.

How far does it go? In early June, Randy Stair, a.k.a Andrew Blaze, who also identified as a woman, expressed his anger and victimhood on social media. He said: “I just want to kill people it doesn’t matter who it is.” Then he bolted the doors so no one could escape and opened fire on all his “transphobic” coworkers, killing three and then killing himself.

When we talk about the transgender suicide rate, we should ask how many killed or harmed others before they killed themselves In 2016-17 there have been numerous trans-linked cases of rampage killings: see here, here, here, and here.

If you read trans avocates’ words and watch their YouTube videos in response, it seems their own grandiosity and exaggerated sense of injury coupled with a lack of empathy and exhibitionism feed the narcissistic rage that fronts as social justice. It is like an overpopulated folie a deux. And the LGBT reaction is to avoid responsibility, reject empathy, and ignore the victims. What are they upset about? A male killer was called a male. He was “misgendered,” and that is reason enough to murder as many people as possible.

Abuse Normalized In Context of LGBT Parenting

Tur’s intention to publicly shame his daughter and get the mob to turn on her gives a glimpse into alarmingly common LGBT parenting tactics. An increasing number of adult children of LGBT are familiar with these tactics and indicate a subculture of abusive behaviors that have not been named, widely documented, or described yet, and that have no accurate analogy in parenting and family dynamics historically, culturally, or psychologically.

The children live in an ideological lie where the sexual and gender identity of adults is paramount.

Recall that Rosie O’Donnell has used this same tactic extensively. For example: “Rosie O’Donnell’s daughter blasts her as a pot-smoking phony.” To dodge scrutiny LGBT activists fill the rooms with chatters and comparisons to all other types of bad parenting that “breeders” can be accused of. Or they appeal to authority and present advocacy research designed to do three things: counter common sense, subvert the needs of children, and reframe the child’s reality in the culture and deny them their basic rights.

As Tur and O’Donnell demonstrate, for their children—including adult children—there is no privacy, no trust, and no safety because sexual identity and gender are committed to an ideology of entitlement that is de-facto only conditionally supportive. Children sent off to their room with no dinner for being “transphobic and homophobic” sounds absurd, but crowd-sourcing abuse is not a joke.

The culture of sexual and gender identity is adult-centered. And family, when all goes well is a performance piece, a musical carousel turning the circle to show the adults in both their best light and as the long-suffering victims. The posturing distorts reality and demands everyone else live in that distortion. The children live in an ideological lie where the sexual and gender identity of adults is paramount.

This creates a new kind of orphan cut off from trusted adult support. The children of LGBT parents continue to document accounts of homelessness, drugs, sexual experimentation, and academic and social struggles. Some can be seen in their books and blogs—see here, here, here, and here.

The Research Reinforces Worries

Researchers take risks with their careers and physical safety if they expose anything that puts the LGBT narrative in question, such as for professor Mark Regnerus, Michael Bailey, and Alice Dreger. While pro-LGBT researchers and supporters say there is “no difference” in parenting, Donald Paul Sullins has looked at extensive data calling that into question. His analysis of the data noted that the “quality of care” on a financial level had little impact. So what’s the difference? Clearly something elusive.

In her most recent book, “In The Dark Room,” feminist Susan Faludi, whose “vicious bully” father “transitioned” in his later years, recounts her father walking around in front of her naked at all hours. She described her father’s jealousy, the male fetishized sexualization of the idea of woman, perennial demand for attentions, and bullying.

We’ve yet to initiate a robust conversation about the ways progressive ideologies cover up a social dysfunction that has taken the title “the new civil rights.” Does LGBT really look like any actual ethnic or racial group, or does it function like a cult of emotional distortions, control issues, and blackmail that thieves familiar arguments from marginalized groups? Think about it: men not allowed in locker rooms with little girls is Jim Crow?

At this point people should be fed up with these familiar totalitarian tactics, the “newspeak,” the preferred and made-up pronouns, the charge of heresy—phobic, bigot, hater. These maneuvers seen as political and social spill over into all interactions.

It should be no surprise that no national LGBT organization has ever addressed child abuse in LGBT families. Yet they have thousands of centers for “queer kids” from heterosexual and Christian homes. We have stepped off the precipice. We may hang in mid-air for a second like Wylie E. Coyote before we realize and hit bottom. In this ego relationship, Tur might say he loves his daughter. I would tell him that not all love is a virtue.

What Planning My Wedding Showed Me About LGBT Discrimination,"We met our wedding photographer at our neighborhood coffee shop on a busy Sunday morning in January.

“What brings you all the way out to D.C.?” I asked her.

“I came into town for the Women’s March on Washington!”

My face struggled for a second trying to keep my eyes from rolling up to the ceiling. I had spent the previous day inside, hiding from the temptation to confront every pink p-ssy-hatted woman who passed me on the street. My fiancé and I had titled our engagement announcement Make Marriage Great Again, so I thought it might be best to keep my mouth shut.

“That’s cool,” I finally offered.

As we talked, however, I saw how passionate she was for the art of photography and for telling the story of our budding relationship. She would, after all, be responsible for creating the most important physical link between our future and that single day when we committed our lives to each other forever and ever, amen. So we put down a deposit.

Artistry Is Far More Personal Than Delivering Goods

We cut checks for many things for our wedding: the reception hall, the limo, flowers, food, and, of course, the booze. But as important as booze is to a big German-Italian wedding, there was a noticeable difference between calling up the local liquor store for a flatbed delivery of the good stuff and the meetings we had with the photographer, the cake baker, the reception hall owner, and my aunt, the florist, who has the most vibrant green thumb you ever saw.

Debate over laws such as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and the First Amendment Defense Act (FADA) is often reduced to a battle of rhetoric: is refusing to actively participate in or offer certain services to a wedding ceremony for LGBT persons an exercise of religious conviction, or is it merely a license to discriminate against them?

This is the central question of a case the Supreme Court has just taken up, involving a Christian baker in Colorado and a same-sex couple who requested a custom cake to celebrate their wedding.

I’ll lay my cards on the table. I do believe we need a balancing test between a citizen’s religious concerns and the sometimes conflicting interests of the state, and I’m open to arguments that proposed policies could be tweaked to create a truer test. I have always supported these policies intellectually. After interacting with the kinds of people they’re meant to protect, however, I realized that we need a deeper commitment to protecting the artists that photographers, bakers, and florists are.

Let’s All Step Outside Ourselves and Have Compassion

What planning my own wedding showed me is how hard it is to imagine anyone else’s concerns but my own. This is a sign that the freedom allowing us to be a truly liberal society — the freedom to disagree — is eroding faster than you can say “bigot.”

I will never know what it would be like to look through my photographer’s portfolio, to fall in love with her use of light and shadow and perspective, only to be told that I would have to find someone else. I hope I can have compassion for those who do experience this.

At the same time, I ask those who call religious freedom a “license to discriminate” to imagine the difference between purchasing alcohol and compensating another person for using her artistic, transcendent, and uniquely human creativity to help celebrate a marriage.

There were so many times throughout wedding planning that I simply deferred to my photographer, florist, baker, and reception host because I didn’t want to inhibit the artistry that seemed to just flow from their skilled hands and fertile minds. Interacting with them was a highly personal matter, much more so than the simple exchange of goods.

Art Comes From the Soul, and Should Never Be Compelled

We all need to bring more imagination to the public square because it is not access to these things — cake, flowers, pictures — that is up for debate, but the incredible capacities that we have as human beings, and the freedom that allows us to develop our talents in accord with our morality. To sue these artists out of business, frankly, is political censorship of art, and we should be terrified that this happens in America.

I’m sure I disagree politically with my photographer. Maybe she doesn’t see any problem with gay marriage. That’s the norm for my generation now, and supporting gay weddings has been integrated into most of my peers’ moral code. I know photographers who are deliberately making an effort to photograph more gay weddings, and they should have the freedom to do that. But either way, I don’t want my heady opinions — aesthetic or political — disrupting how my photographer practices her art.

There really are photographers, bakers, and florists who value marriage between a man and a woman as a human participation in divine creativity. Just as our photographer took a special interest in our relationship at least in a humanist way, other artists participate in weddings in a religious way, using their creative talents to help couples fulfill a piece of God’s plan. What has our society become if we will not let them do that?

How Fred Rogers Would Help An Eight-Year-Old Drag Queen,"Exploitation of children is rampant today. Just check out this video posted to the Facebook page of LGBTinthecity. It’s an interview with eight-year-old drag queen “Lactatia,” who tells the audience “If you want to be a drag queen and your parents don’t let you, you need new parents!” At about 3:00 in the video you can watch him dance provocatively—or “twerk”—surrounded by a crowd of raucous adults at an LGBT nightclub event in Montreal.

Some would say Lactatia is being authentic. No, he’s not. He’s projecting a persona. And it’s obviously a persona he’s been groomed to project. Insecure kids will imitate and recite practically anything that gets them positive reinforcement. This is especially true if they’ve never been taught to discern reality and think clearly.

Another example of such behavior is the little boy twerking at an LGBT pride parade a couple of years ago. Or the eight-year-old whose performance in a New York pride parade was praised by Perez Hilton.

Such performances aren’t enough to satisfy the LGBT lobby, though. Consider a new propagandistic “transgender toy” introduced to “teach” kids and parents that sex distinctions aren’t real. Trans activists are also pushing hard for laws that prohibit parents from even affirming their child’s biological sex.

This is echoed not only in Lactatia’s proclamation that such parents should be replaced, but in recent laws that have actually been passed under the guise of anti-discrimination, such as in Illinois and in the Canadian province of Ontario. Those laws serve to seek out and dismiss any public employee who works with children but does not affirm transgenderism and homosexuality. They also serve to prohibit placing children into foster families who affirm biological sex differences.

What Would Mr. Rogers Say?

All of this recent activity has me wondering how the late Fred Rogers would react if he could survey this landscape. As host of the beloved public television show for young children, “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,” he appreciated the simplicity, innocence, and wonder of being a child.

Ironically, Rogers continues to be a darling of the political Left, well beyond his death in 2003. About 80 folks from the Fred Rogers Center partnered with the Clinton Global Initiative Conference in 2013, per Hillary Clinton’s focus on early childhood education.

Indeed, Rogers had a soft spot for pacificism and environmentalism. As early as the 1960s, he helped kids explore hobbies and interests not traditionally associated with their sex. He is perhaps most admired for telling his little viewers, “I like you just the way you are.”

Some might interpret this to mean Rogers would have been a proponent of affirming transgenderism in children—perhaps therefore a strong proponent of injecting hormone blockers into them in preparation for an easier surgical transition. Or that he would support males using girls sports to tilt the playing field in their favor. Well, I beg to differ with such interpretations.

Despite the coziness of the Fred Rogers Center with advocates of left-wing politics, if you search for the terms “transgender” or “gender identity” or “LGBT” on its website, all searches so far come up with “no posts found.” Maybe that’s because the foundation claims to be “staying true” to his vision and legacy. But maybe it’s just a matter of time before they pop up, since gender ideology inevitably marinates everything.

After all, the Obama administration made a point of enforcing transgenderism in all aspects of life, including education, the corporate world, and the military. For the moment, anyhow, the Fred Rogers legacy and transgender advocacy are not hand in glove. In fact, there is overwhelming evidence that Rogers made a point of helping children affirm the sex into which they were born. Repeatedly.

‘Everybody’s Fancy. Everybody’s Fine’

Rogers wrote his famous ditty “Everybody’s Fancy” in 1967. He continued singing it on his show into the 1990s. It’s about children’s discovery of differences between themselves and others, specifically their discovery of sex differences. At some point in early development, children realize that some people have penises and others don’t. Or, as Rogers put it: “Some are fancy on the outside. Some are fancy on the inside.”

The point of the song is to reassure children that these differences are not only natural, but something with which they should be completely at peace. That’s because we were all born “as a boy baby” or “as a girl baby.” Either way, Mr. Rogers assures every child that he or she is special. Children should not reject the physical reality of their bodies, but simply accept the reality so they can place their focus outward, on all of the marvels of the world.

Unfortunately, the gender ideology being mandated into so much sex education today urges children to obsess on sex differences as something that is not real for anybody, but “assigned at birth” for everybody. That would make Rogers’ song heretical and very politically incorrect. Just consider these lyrics:

Some are fancy on the outside.

Some are fancy on the inside.

Everybody’s fancy.

Everybody’s fine.

Your body’s fancy and so is mine.

Boys are boys from the beginning. [Spoken: When you’re born a boy baby, you grow up to be a bigger boy, and then a man]

Girls are girls right from the start. [Spoken: When you’re born a girl baby, You grow up to be a bigger girl, and then a woman]

Everybody’s fancy.

Everybody’s fine.

Your body’s fancy and so is mine.

Girls grow up to be the mommies.

Boys grow up be the daddies.

Everybody’s fancy.

Everybody’s fine.

Your body’s fancy and so is mine.

I think you’re a special person

And I like your ins and outsides.

Everybody’s fancy.

Everybody’s fine.

Your body’s fancy and so is mine.

Will the memory-holing of “Everybody’s Fancy” begin soon? You can still hear Mr. Rogers singing “Everybody’s Fancy” on the PBSkids Website (as long as you have the proper sound software). You can also take a listen here. But the only video clip I can find of him singing it on YouTube is this badly out-of-synch and incomplete one:



A complete list of the 50 episodes in which he sang this song is on the Neighborhood Archive and all just ran in a May-June marathon of “Mr. Rogers Neighborhood” on TwitchTv.

But the political incorrectness of the song today is no doubt startling to leftist elites. Just consider that after singing the line “Boys are boys from the beginning,” Rogers speaks: “When you’re born a boy baby, you grow up to be a bigger boy and then a man!” Likewise, after singing “Girls are girls right from the start,” Rogers says, “When you’re born a girl baby, you grow up to be a bigger girl, and then a woman!”

The Pressure to ‘Evolve’ and Disavow

Fred Rogers died in 2003. But if he were still alive and didn’t disavow that song, would he be pressured with charges that the song’s message is “transphobic?” Sadly, the answer is likely yes, given today’s trans-saturated media and what we know of Rogers’ status with the Left. Hillary loved him. Rosie O’Donnell loved him. In his day, Mr. Rogers was wildly celebrated and made appearances on many talk shows, including David Letterman and Arsenio Hall.

Now that medical personnel are increasingly being trained not to use the term “expectant mother” so as not to offend pregnant “transmen,” we ought to pay special attention to the lines: “Girls grow up to be the mommies. Boys grow up to be the daddies.” The original version was even more explicit, stating: “Only girls can be the mommies. Only boys can be the daddies.” He later tweaked those lines, likely to be more in tune with more women entering the workforce.

But I’m not sure Rogers would cave to today’s pressures to conform to the transgender narrative, even though, like the Hotel California, once you’ve checked in with the Left you can never leave. A recent Salon article brought up the song, and speculated as to whether Rogers would have “evolved” to reject the “binary” had he been alive to see Bruce Jenner’s transition to Caitlyn.

Piloting the Line Between Reality and Fantasy

Nice try, but I don’t think so. Biological sex distinctions are what the song both recognizes and celebrates. It helps children accept their given bodies as the natural source of human creation and understand how they can become mothers and fathers themselves. Even then, sex differences per se are not the entire story of what “Everybody’s Fancy” is about. In a very general sense, it is a song that helps a child navigate reality.

Mr. Rogers was known for offering soothing reassurances to children that they could “never go down the drain” and that getting one’s hair cut doesn’t hurt a bit. He helped them regulate painful and confusing emotions. Even if he leaned left in his politics, he did not badger children into living in a fog of ambiguity, which is exactly what the “trans toy” does to children’s minds. Gender ideology requires gratuitous ambiguity, even at a time when children crave and need certainty and structure. Imposing that ambiguity on them is cruel.

Even if he leaned left in his politics, he did not badger children into living in a fog of ambiguity.

The world can be very scary for a child who cannot discern what is real from what is not. The message of “Everybody’s Fancy” offers children structure and a clearly defined line between reality and fantasy. In fact, you could say that the entire show of “Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood” was about discerning what is physically real from what is a product of the imagination.

For example, when Mr. Rogers was in his real neighborhood, he would visit shopkeepers and talk about how things were made: musical instruments, puppets, bread. Sometimes he’d give a tour of how things were manufactured by machine, like that favorite toddler food, graham crackers.

But when it came time to hear animals talk, or have an everyday conversation with a king, he would announce a visit to the “neighborhood of make-believe.” Then Mr. Rogers would describe to his audience what they would be pretending to do that day. He’d say, for example: “Let’s make believe” such and such about so and so. He even used a little trolley as a transition vehicle for leaving the real neighborhood and crossing the line into the land of make-believe.

After the make-believe session, the trolley would return back to reality. Indeed, in a Television Academy interview in 1999, Rogers stated, “I wanted the children to see that everything in reality was real. So I showed them, underneath, the switch that makes the trolley work. Of course, once it goes to make-believe, then anything can happen.”

How to Use One’s Imagination for Good

Today there is precious little talk about children actually using their imaginations. The difference between reality and fantasy is little noted. Maybe that’s because cyber technologies and devices create so many illusions, especially as we immerse ourselves in social media, cyber-graphics, and political correctness. Perhaps transgenderism is just a predictable outgrowth of our saturation with those illusions, an outgrowth of spending so much time obsessing within our own mental “neighborhoods of make-believe” without a healthy balance of time spent in reality.

A child’s healthy imagination cannot exist in the absence of respect for physical reality.

But the line has gotten so blurred and so confusing for children precisely because of today’s ideological agendas and polarization. Gender ideology doesn’t simply beckon children into a land of make-believe where they can change their physical sex if they just wish hard enough. It’s a one-way street that cuts off any escape hatch back to reality. This is not the exercise of healthy imagination, but more like cult programming.

A child’s healthy imagination cannot exist in the absence of respect for physical reality. Children must know that they are special and fine “just the way they are,” whether “born a boy baby” or “born a girl baby.”

I don’t know exactly what motivates gender ideologists to use children like “Lactatia” or “trans toys” to push their mindset so hard on all children and all families. But perhaps they should contemplate the following words from the Fred Rogers song: “What Do You Do with the Mad that You Feel?”

It’s great to be able to stop

When you’ve planned a thing that’s wrong,

And be able to do something else instead

And think this song:

I can stop when I want to

Can stop when I wish.

I can stop, stop, stop any time.

And what a good feeling to feel like this

And know that the feeling is really mine.

Know that there’s something deep inside

That helps us become what we can.

For a girl can be someday a woman

And a boy can be someday a man.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/07/05/mr-rogers-help-eight-year-old-drag-queen/,2017-07-05
Ultra-Rich Gay Activist On Targeting Christians: It’s Time To ‘Punish The Wicked’,"In a recent interview with Rolling Stone magazine, tech millionaire turned LGBTQ activist Tim Gill said he’s aiming to punish Christians who don’t want to participate in same-sex weddings.

For more than two decades, the software programmer has poured an estimated $422 million into various gay rights causes. After the Supreme Court ruled gay marriage legal in all 50 states in 2015, Gill turned his attention and resources to targeting Christians.

The election of Donald Trump, who claims to support gay rights but stocked his administration with anti-LGBTQ extremists, has only emboldened those looking to erase the gains of the past decade. Gill refuses to go on the defense. ‘We’re going into the hardest states in the country,’ he says. ‘We’re going to punish the wicked.’

Allow me to add some context. After the Obergefell ruling in 2015, which forced all 50 states to perform same-sex marriages, several state legislatures passed protections to ensure that those who object to participating in a same-sex wedding for religious reasons have recourse when hauled into courts or extralegal commissions for this belief. It’s these state laws that Gill and his various nonprofit entities have decided to go after — and persecute Christians along the way.

Here’s how Rolling Stone — a magazine with a history of throwing journalistic ethics and pesky things like truth and accuracy out the window to advance a narrative that fits their agenda — describes religious freedom restoration acts (RFRA): “Under the guise of right-to-worship protections, these bills offer legal cover for individuals and businesses to deny service or otherwise discriminate against LGBTQ people,” Rolling Stone‘s Andy Kroll wrote.

Except that’s not at all what religious freedom restoration acts are. For one thing, religious Americans still serve gay customers in myriad capacities, just as they do every other customer. Their objections are to being forced to use their artistic talents to proclaim particular speech they find fundamentally false or to be required to participate in a religious ceremony that conflicts with their consciences. As Sean Davis has explained, these laws simply ask that judges use a simple balancing test when ruling on cases involving a person’s religious freedom.

The laws state that the government may only substantially burden the free exercise of religion of a person or organization if the government 1) has a compelling interest to do so, and 2) is using the least restrictive means possible to further that compelling interest. In legal parlance, RFRA requires courts to use strict scrutiny when adjudicating these types of cases.

Nevertheless, asking a judge to think twice before demanding that a baker craft a wedding cake for a lesbian couple and stomping all over his freedom of expression is apparently a wicked deed that Gill intends to punish.

Last year, the Gill Foundation set up a group to wrangle corporate support in going after religious freedom proponents in Georgia. Called “Georgia Prospers,” the fake grassroots effort organized protests against a religious freedom restoration act that passed the state legislature. The pressure from the corporate-backed endeavor dissuaded Georgia’s governor from signing the bill — a victory for the wealthy activist.

The group also opposed North Carolina’s bathroom bill, which barred cities from passing laws that would force businesses to allow customers and employees to use restrooms that are not consistent with their biological sex.

Along the way, Christian business owners have been maligned and demonized for not wanting to participate in a same-sex wedding. In Colorado, a cake baker was forced to change his company’s policies and provide training to staff after he objected to baking a cake for a gay couple. A Christian couple was slapped with a $13,000 fine for refusing to host a same-sex wedding on their property. People threatened to burn a pizza shop to the ground after its owners answered that they would happily serve gay customers, they just wouldn’t want to cater a gay wedding should they be asked to do so.

Linda Sarsour Proves She’s An Unhinged Murderer Apologist,"When Jake Tapper, CNN’s chief washington correspondent, slammed Linda Sarsour and other progressive leaders of the anti-Trump Women’s March for honoring convicted cop-killer Assata Shakur, Sarsour proceeded to dismiss Tapper as “alt-right.”

Of all the possible ways to describe Tapper, “alt-right” is not one. Tapper is one of President Trump’s most vocal critics. And he’s Jewish. Someone should tell Sarsour this would likely disqualify him for membership in any white supremacist group. But Sarsour’s “resume,” Tapper’s condemnation of her, and their subsequent Twitter exchange illustrate the extent to which this darling of the progressive Left—and her progressive Left followers—are unhinged.

This Murderer Is So Awesome, Guys

Shakur is a felon, convicted in 1977 for murdering a New Jersey police officer, assaulting another police officer, and bank robbery. In 1979 she escaped prison and fled to Cuba. She remains on the FBI’s “Most Wanted Terrorist” list to this day.

Sarsour’s idolizing of Shakur follows on the heels of her presentation at the 54th annual convention of the Islamic Society of North America, where she called on Muslims to commit jihad against the American government.

“I hope that we, when we stand up to those who oppress our [Muslim] communities, that Allah accepts from us that as a form of jihad,” said Sarsour. “That we are struggling against tyrants and rulers, not only abroad in the Middle East or on the other side of the world, but here, in these United States of America.”

In an interview soon after with The Washington Post, Sarsour was quick to clarify that her speech at ISNA was advocating solely for peaceful, nonviolent dissent, and that her call for jihad only meant the use of words. In a later op-ed for the publication, Sarsour doubled down on her claim that she was only calling for “nonviolent” jihad.

“Yeah, and the swastika is just a Tibetan good luck charm,” as the late comedian Robin Williams so eloquently put it.

But I Also Love Mass Murderers and Their Inciters

Sarsour began her ISNA presentation by thanking her “favorite person” in the room, Imam Siraj Wahaj, praising him as her “mentor, motivator and encourager.” Wahaj, an unindicted co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, has called for violent jihad and replacing the U.S. government with an Islamic caliphate. Sarsour’s mentor has also denounced homosexuality as “a disease of this [American] society,” noting that the penalty for homosexuality under Islamic law is death.

But this doesn’t seem right. How can such a self-declared progressive proponent of social justice have such a violent homophobic bigot for a mentor? Maybe ISNA can shed some light on this glaring contradiction.

Federal prosecutors have said that ISNA is part of the U.S Muslim Brotherhood network set up to funnel money to the terrorist group Hamas. ISNA conferences have long featured radical Islamists, anti-Semites, Holocaust-deniers, and homophobes as keynote speakers. An exclusive video from PJ Media shows al-Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, just days before the 9/11 terror attacks, lecturing on “tolerance” at that year’s ISNA convention.

At this year’s ISNA convention, a pro-LGBT and feminist Muslim organization was expelled from tabling. Muslims for Progressive Values, whose pamphlets advocate for LGBT and women’s equality within Islam, drew the ire of an ultra-orthodox attendee, resulting in ISNA staff asking MPV to close shop and vacate the venue.

“We’re really sick and tired of the hypocrisy of them [ISNA] claiming to be LGBT allies,” said Ani Zonneveld, founder and president of MPV. “They’re only an ally when the camera is on.”

Strangely, Sarsour hasn’t uttered one word of protest, despite vocally leading a national march and “movement” against what the Resistance calls President Trump’s anti-LGBT regime. But to be fair, she may have been too busy swindling Jewish cemeteries out of their money. Back in March, an organization connected to Sarsour pledged $100,000 to conduct necessary repairs at a Colorado Jewish cemetery. The money has yet to arrive.

Also, People Who Disagree With Me Should Be Brutalized

The ever-so-peaceful, nonviolent Sarsour has called for the genital mutilation of women who disagree with her. In 2011, this self-described progressive feminist tweeted against Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Brigitte Gabriel, an Arab Christian survivor of the Lebanese Civil War, stating they did not deserve to be women and that she wanted to take away their vaginas.

This is especially vile considering that Ali was a victim of female genital mutilation as a five-year-old in Somalia. When a student confronted Sarsour about the tweet, she attacked him for being a white man.

Sarsour’s latest Twitter argument confirms that she doesn’t really care about racial equality, LGBT rights, or the rights of women. For all of her screeching at critics to “check their privilege,” a better idea would be for Sarsour to check her gigantic ego at the door.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/07/21/linda-sarsour-proves-shes-unhinged-murderer-apologist/,2017-07-21
Rolling Stone Confirms: Rich Gay Activist Is Targeting 'Wicked' Christians,"Last week, I wrote about how tech millionaire turned gay rights activist Tim Gill has been deliberately targeting Christians who believe participating in a same-sex wedding ceremony violates their religious beliefs. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Gill said:

The election of Donald Trump, who claims to support gay rights but stocked his administration with anti-LGBTQ extremists, has only emboldened those looking to erase the gains of the past decade. Gill refuses to go on the defense. ‘We’re going into the hardest states in the country,’ he says. ‘We’re going to punish the wicked.’

It’s obvious from the context of the piece that Gill is referring to his foundation’s efforts to legally compel Christian business owners to participate in same-sex weddings, which I pointed out. Then Rolling Stone’s Andy Kroll, the author of the feature piece on Gill, got defensive, and wrote that I “badly mangled” the millionaire’s words.

“Pointing to this solitary quote, conservative outlets say that Gill is ‘targeting’ Christians,” Kroll wrote in a response piece last week.

The Federalist writes that Gill is ‘aiming to punish Christians who don’t want to participate in same-sex weddings’ . . . This is complete nonsense. Not once in my profile does Gill talk about ‘targeting’ Christians. Not once does Gill so much as hint at singling out Christians or adherents of any other religion. Not once does the word ‘Christian’ appear. The authors of these cookie-cutter stories sprouting up across the conservative blogosphere either didn’t bother to read the actual piece or were blinded by their own biases.

To be clear, I did read the actual piece in full, of course. But let’s get to the heart of Kroll’s accusations — that I misrepresented Gill’s words and that my piece, which stated he was “targeting Christians,” was false. As it turns out, Kroll confirms just a few paragraphs later that I accurately represented Gill’s remarks (emphasis mine).

First, some background. Gill has used the phrase ‘punish the wicked’ as a rallying cry for years. ‘The wicked’ is anyone who stands in the way of progress on equal rights for LGBTQ people: politicians, activists, lawyers, some people of faith, and plenty more with no religious affiliation whatsoever.

Ah, so “the wicked'” whom Gill says need to be “punished” are indeed Christians, as well as everyone who agrees with them. Anyone who stands up for a Christian’s right to live in accordance with his or her religious beliefs will also be targeted for harassment in public and the legal system. Further, he clearly defines “wickedness” as adhering to centuries-old Christian (and Jewish and Muslim) beliefs on human identity and sexuality. To Gill, orthodox Christian beliefs comprise “wickedness.” Thanks for clearing that up.

Now would probably be a good time to explain what these often-maligned religious freedom restoration bills actually are. They are not, as liberals and those in the media like to paint them, bigoted, anti-gay pieces of legislation, nor do they legalize discrimination. As Sean Davis explained, these laws simply ask judges to use a balancing test when ruling on religious freedom cases.

The laws state that the government may only substantially burden the free exercise of religion of a person or organization if the government 1) has a compelling interest to do so, and 2) is using the least restrictive means possible to further that compelling interest. In legal parlance, RFRA requires courts to use strict scrutiny when adjudicating these types of cases.

Nevertheless, asking a judge to think twice before throwing the book at a Christian baker who doesn’t want to bake a cake for a lesbian wedding is a “wickedness” that ought to be stamped out, according to Gill.

For the quote in question, ‘the wicked’ refers to anti-equality lawmakers on the ballot in 2016, such as then-North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory, who signed his state’s infamous HB2 bathroom bill. (With Gill’s help, Democrat Roy Cooper ousted McCrory and then partially repealed HB2.) ‘The wicked’ refers to the lawmakers who, in response to the Supreme Court’s 2015 Obergefell decision legalizing same-sex marriage, have introduced dozens of so-called religious freedom restoration bills that would give legal cover for individuals and businesses to discriminate against LGBTQ people.

In other words, “the wicked” are people who introduced bills to offer legal recourse for people of faith at the state level after the Supreme Court ruled same-sex marriage must be legal in all 50 states. They are the people who support and work to strengthen America’s First Amendment protections of conscience for all people. I hate to be the one to say it, but I was right!",https://thefederalist.com/2017/07/24/rolling-stone-confirms-ultra-rich-gay-activist-chief-target-wicked-christians/,2017-07-24
Cake Wars And The Coming Conflict Over Religious Liberty,"There is an inquisition in America, and its plans for non-conformists are simple: to drive us out of our professions, shutter our businesses and institutions, bankrupt us and even put us in jail. I wish this was hyperbole. But case after case shows that the leaders of the LGBT movement and its allies are determined to hijack anti-discrimination law to silence all dissent. Consider the following parade of persecution.

Florist Barronelle Stutzman kindly told a customer whom she had served faithfully for nine years she couldn’t be part of his same-sex wedding ceremony. For this, the state of Washington has levied six-figure fines and is attempting not only to destroy her business, but to seize her retirement account. Jack Phillips of Colorado sold his baked goods to everyone, but turned down custom orders that would have required using his artistry is ways that violated his conscience. This wasn’t a problem when, for example, he refused to make lewd bachelor party cakes. But when he politely declined to make a custom cake for a same-sex ceremony, the government came after him—imposing heavy fines and demanding that he reeducate his employees, including his family.

Other laws are even worse. Angel and Carl Larsen of Telescope Media are challenging a Minnesota law that, in addition to heavy fines, could imprison them for 90 days if they decline to use their artistic ability to tell the story of a same-sex wedding. In Phoenix, Joanna Duka and Breanna Koski of Brush and Nib Studios are fighting a law that would require them to use their artistic talents to promote same-sex wedding ceremonies or face crippling fines and six months in jail—and that also imposes a gag order that prohibits them from even explaining their religious beliefs.

This persecution isn’t confined to the wedding industry. Atlanta fire chief Kelvin Cochran was fired for writing a Bible-study book that expressed the traditional Christian view of human sexuality and marriage. At least one Catholic hospital has been sued for refusing to remove healthy reproductive organs at the request of a trans individual. And so on. Column after column could be filled with examples of Rod Dreher’s Law of Merited Impossibility: “It will never happen, and when it does, you bigots will deserve it.” What the LGBT movement dismissed as “alarmism” yesterday is its preferred policy today.

Dignitary vs. Material Harm

This context makes the thoughtful and engaging book Debating Religious Liberty and Discrimination, by John Corvino, Ryan T. Anderson, and Sherif Girgis, timely and necessary. This book provides a good introduction into current debates over religious liberty, and offers genuine debate on these issues, with Corvino taking one side, and Anderson and Girgis, writing jointly, the other. Of course the authors are not in total opposition. They all proclaim that it is important to maintain religious liberty and to oppose unjust discrimination. But they differ dramatically regarding emphasis and implementation, illuminating the contours of debate over cases like those above.

A crucial difference is that for Anderson and Girgis, anti-discrimination laws are primarily pragmatic, while for Corvino they are principled. That is, Anderson and Girgis see these laws as proportionate remedies for injustices of a certain sort and severity, with state-enforced racial segregation being the classic example. In contrast, Corvino seems to see them as essential because of the message they send, regardless of the extent of existing injustice. He considers dignitary harm a significant justification for anti-discrimination laws, while Anderson and Girgis are mostly concerned with material harm.

To illustrate, a same-sex couple might be discomfited if their request for a wedding cake is turned down (dignitary harm), but they are not locked out of access to essential goods or services (material harm). Even though permitting a few non-conformist wedding vendors to opt-out of same-sex weddings does no real material harm to anyone, Corvino sees the potential dignitary harm as sufficient to justify government coercion. To the extent that he entertains possible exceptions, they are based not on religious freedom but on the artistic and expressive nature of custom work.

While Corvino is skeptical of religious exemptions, complaining that they make for “Swiss cheese” law, he suggests a sort of “Swiss cheese” enforcement, calling for LGBT activists and their allies to overlook some violations. But Stutzman, whom he singles out as deserving such forbearance, has been given none. Likewise, though he is “inclined to agree” that the six-figure penalty imposed on an Oregon couple for declining to bake a cake for a same-sex ceremony was excessive, he still wants them punished.

Through this legal two-step, where he supports the laws but deplores their implementation, Corvino tries to have his cake and eat it too. If Corvino doesn’t want Barronelle and others sued into financial oblivion, he shouldn’t support laws that turn all non-conformist wedding vendors into outlaws.

A Parade of Horribles

Corvino’s support for laws that he admits disproportionately penalize people is due to his desire to have the law protect LGBT people not only from unjust discrimination but also from psychological harm, and to “send a message about the harmfulness of anti-LGBT views.” Thus, he rejects even easy accommodation for religious believers when it could “reinforce sentiments that ought to be repudiated.”

Consequently, he moralizes in scandalized tones over possible abuses of religious liberty. Anderson and Girgis observe that he relies on a mostly-imaginary “parade of horribles” to bolster his case. He even worries about “morally unpalatable” outcomes for those few religious liberty exemptions he does favor. But the weakness of his argument is revealed by his persistent need to invent new religious wackiness because he can’t find a real example among the multitude of American sects and creeds. The current state of religious liberty and anti-discrimination laws isn’t causing the sky to fall, despite all the hypotheticals Corvino can dream up.

Furthermore, most of his parade of horribles (real or imagined) is pretty weak stuff. While there is plenty of stupidity, silliness, and even malice in Corvino’s examples of religious liberty run amok, few would inflict significant harm if tolerated or accommodated. In this debate, it is the conservative Catholics, not the gay professor, who are tolerant of diversity, including what they see as error.

This tolerance flows naturally from the philosophical and legal framework that Anderson and Girgis develop. Overall, they offer a much more comprehensive, detailed, and coherent argument than Corvino, whose unfortunate choice to frequently write in a “thinking out loud” manner handicaps his case. While his skepticism of “tidy system building” is not unwarranted, Corvino overcompensates, leaving his contributions meandering and lacking in rigor. On the other side, although the “New Natural Law Theory” that Anderson and Girgis rely on has a weakness for too-neat systematizing, they avoid it here.

Living With Integrity

They build a compelling case for freedom of religion and conscience on the foundation of the basic human good of integrity. To live with integrity is to harmonize one’s beliefs and actions, to live authentically with one’s convictions, social relations, and understanding of the transcendent. Such integrity is a basic experiential good, even if some beliefs are mistaken or imperfectly lived up to. But integrity is also particularly fragile, and therefore deserves special consideration from the government. If the government coerces you into violating your conscience and abandoning your integrity, where can you go to get it back?

Of course, freedom of conscience is not a blank check; there are legitimate reasons for government to punish certain actions, however authentic the convictions behind them. But the burden of proof in such cases rests with the government. Demanding that people violate their deeply held moral convictions, or disobey what they believe are the edicts of God, is not to be done lightly, and there are long-standing legal tests to weigh such cases.

Such conflicts between state and conscience can be resolved by limiting the scope of government, or by writing exemptions into the law for those whose conscience rights it would unduly burden, or by vindicating the conscience rights of non-conformists in court. In a society that values integrity and authenticity, all of these methods of protecting conscience rights will have their place.

And it is odd that Corvino doesn’t recognize the force of the argument for religious liberty based on personal integrity, given that the LGBT movement’s reliance on arguments rooted in personal integrity and authenticity: This is who I am, allow me the freedom to live and love in accordance with my deeply felt identity. But he and his allies seem disinclined to practice what they preach about tolerance.

While Anderson and Girgis do not support ideological libertarianism, their approach does have a great deal of live and let live in it, especially as regards the liberty to live authentically in civil society. They argue that it is not government’s role to purify every heart or eliminate all evils, only to prevent or punish them to the extent needed for the flourishing of civil society. Indeed, anti-discrimination laws, both current and proposed, still leave plenty of space for injustice, yet Corvino’s imaginary parade of horribles fails to materialize. So Anderson and Girgis conclude that the real concern of LGBT activists isn’t with remedying actual material harm, or even curbing widespread dignitary harm, but with crushing dissent.

Ironically, this will result in the sort of dignitary harm that Corvino claims to want to prevent. Surely Phillips will suffer dignitary harm if Colorado succeeds in compelling him to reeducate his employees, including his own family, to say nothing of the financial penalties. If Christians and others with traditional views of marriage are penalized (often heavily) if they do not check their beliefs upon entering the market square, then the government is declaring them to be morally inferior—the very definition of Corvino’s dignitary harm.

Free Speech Will Be Next

If religious and conscience freedoms are overridden for the sake of dignity, then free speech will be next, as it is often far more offensive to dignity. The groundwork for this is already being laid, and polls routinely show distressingly high levels of support for restrictions on so-called hate speech. Corvino tries to arrest this tendency by distinguishing between speech and action. But what he actually wants to punish is not action but inaction. Phillips and Stutzman are being punished for saying that they wouldn’t do something.

This is the heart of the matter. Anderson and Girgis argue that such cases, in which feelings are hurt but no one is denied access to essential goods and services, rarely justify government intervention. For Corvino, dignitary harm and the need to send a message necessitate government intervention and override religious liberty concerns. Anderson and Girgis hold that freedom of religion and conscience is a good in itself, essential to the good of personal integrity, which has value even for those whose convictions are wrong. Corvino mostly views religious freedom as an instrumental good that can ameliorate the potential for religious conflict, and he sees nothing of value in the integrity of those whose convictions are badly wrong. Error has no rights. So it is he, more than his debating partners, who views government as a tool of righteousness.

Some of his allies are even more direct about this. A recent Rolling Stone profile of Tim Gill, who spends vast sums bankrolling LGBT activism, says this about the movement’s plans: “We’re going to punish the wicked.” So much for “Love Wins.” Now it’s time to punish. That’s the voice of an inquisitor, a heretic-hunter. And that is what the LGBT movement and its allies are becoming.

Too many American Christians are ignorant of this. They don’t know that their brothers and sisters in Christ are being persecuted—losing their jobs, businesses, assets, and perhaps their liberty. Too many in other religious communities do not recognize that an attack on the religious freedom of one is an attack on all; conservative Catholics and evangelicals are the first targets, but we won’t be the last.

Finally, too many who support same-sex marriage do not notice the persecution that has begun in their name. It is possible to support same-sex marriage without seeking to punish non-conformists or erode religious liberty. Millions of same-sex marriage supporters would likely be horrified if they looked at the details of how anti-discrimination law is being perverted into a weapon of religious persecution. Despite disagreements, they don’t want their conservative friends and family to be destroyed for sincere religious beliefs that materially harm no one.

For them, I have simple questions: Will you tolerate us and stand up for our liberties? And if not, how far are you willing to go to try to force us to recant?

Why Are Lesbian Teens Having More Babies Than Heterosexual Peers?,"One thing you would think lesbians wouldn’t have to deal with is pregnancy. Seems like a solid assumption, right? Not so much.

Remarkably, research shows teen who identify as lesbian have significantly higher pregnancy rates than their heterosexual peers. I know what you’re thinking, but it’s true. It’s also true for teen gay males: they are substantially more likely to impregnate their sexual partners than are heterosexual males. The dramatic disparities are explained in these graphs from the Minneapolis Star Tribune.

Numerous studies across many nations find that sexual-minority youth aged 14 to 19 have pregnancy rates two to seven times greater than their heterosexual peers. And their pregnancy rates continue to rise at a time when the overall teen pregnancy rate is declining in the United States.

Only one study to date, published earlier this year, has examined the pregnancy rates of adult sexual-minority women. It reveals the same thing: unintended pregnancies are higher among sexual-minority women than their heterosexual peers. Their proportions for ending pregnancies by abortion are double that of heterosexual women.

How—And Why—Is This Happening?

After I presented this information to an acquaintance, he said, “That’s scientifically impossible!” But that’s only true if you assume that being gay or lesbian is a sexual absolute—the way someone is, unchangeably what they are. Unless biology has transformed overnight, it means women who identify as lesbians are having a whole lot of guy sex. And gay-identified youth are having a great deal of girl sex.

But being gay or lesbian is supposed to be absolute and unchangeable—like sex, race, or ethnicity. This pregnancy phenomenon confounds that narrative in a dramatic way, and it can’t be ignored. Could it be that being lesbian or gay is not quite as absolute or fixed as gender theorists want us to believe?

Sure, lesbians could occasionally veer off their path and get pregnant. Gays could do the same and end up making babies. It wouldn’t be that surprising. But think about what we have going on here: we know that as a whole, heterosexual youth are more sexually active than nearly every adult would wish, and their pregnancy rates are too high as well. It’s a national concern.

But gays and lesbians have a two to seven times greater rate of pregnancy, and double the rate of abortion. That’s a great deal of pregnancy-possible sex going on among teens and adults who are supposedly “born that way” to want non-pregnancy-possible sex.

First, we must ask what’s going in the emotional lives of these individuals that has them behaving in such a hyper-sexualized manner? What emptiness are they seeking to fill? Their own dignity and well-being demands honest investigation, free of ideological assumptions. Insisting it’s simply a lack of good sex education or social affirmation—which seems to be the left’s default answers for such things—is nothing short of malpractice. But one thing is for sure, it means that these categorical identities we call “gay” and “lesbian” don’t exist as we assume they do. They certainly do as political or social identities. But in functional actuality, where it really matters, these pregnancy rates greatly challenge that narrative.

They indicate far more is going on here than gay and lesbian folks simply coming to terms with their sexuality. It appears to make a case for a fluid mushiness in non-heterosexual sexual identities, doing great violence to the prevailing LGBT political narrative.

Is Sexual Orientation Fluid And Changeable?

Erotic plasticity. Sexual fluidity. These are terms coined by scholars to explain that the fixedness of non-hetero orientations is often illusory in adulthood as well. This fluidity is particularly true for women, making the L of LGBT a dramatically different animal at its very core than the G. Through his clinical research on the subject, Northwestern University’s J. Michael Bailey questions whether a female sexual orientation exists at all. He contends that we cannot miss that male and female sexual natures are markedly different things, so much so that the singular, lifelong lesbian is a rare creature. Female sexual interests and behaviors are shaped more by social, cultural, emotional, and situational developments than some deeper internal drive.

In her important book “Sexual Fluidity” Professor Lisa Diamond laments the mistaken assumption that lesbianism is fixed like male homosexuality and argues that this belief is the result of gay-normativity and male prejudice in gay research. She is hopeful that this has changed slightly in the last decade, revealing a picture of male and female sexual orientation as “distinct phenomena instead of two sides of the same coin.” It reveals that “one of the fundamental, defining features of female sexual orientation is its fluidity,” a “situation-dependent flexibility in women’s sexual responsiveness,” making it possible for women to desire either men or women under certain situations regardless of their generally identified “sexual orientation.” If this is true, it means lesbianism is not an orientation as we popularly understand the term today. Diamond concludes,

This is why a woman like Anne Heche can suddenly find herself falling madly in love with Ellen DeGeneres after an exclusively heterosexual past [and present], and why a longtime lesbian can experience her very first other-sex attractions in her forties.

Not only is female sexuality itself fluid, but so are the personal identifiers women choose for themselves. Remarkably, more than 50 percent of women who had both male and female partners in the last year identify not as bi-sexual or lesbian, but as heterosexual. Eleven percent of women who have known only female sex partners identify as heterosexual, and—remarkably—only 19 percent of women who’ve ever had sex with another woman consider themselves either “lesbian” or “homosexual.” A young woman recently told me that she is a lesbian, but her sexual attraction is to men. Apparently she’s not an outlier.

Lesbianism And Gayness May Differ In Important Ways

Lesbianism and gayness are more different than they are similar in very fundamental ways. The gay male is more likely to stay in one lane for life, even while his sexual desire is generally more aggressive and seeks greater diversity in partners than do women. However, by the pregnancy-risk data, younger men who identify as homosexual appear to be much more fluid in their actions than has been previously assumed. Does this mean that male same-sex attraction is more developmental than fixed? We don’t know.

This all has very important and deeply consequential policy implications for today. Increasingly, communities and entire states are levying life-crushing penalties against individuals who refuse to get on board with certain sexual relationships. It’s assumed this dissent amounts to the rejection of people because of what they are. The Supreme Court has agreed to take up one such case next year. This research further demonstrates that the “this is what I am” canard is precisely that.

"1,000 Leftists Gathered To Cheer A Convicted Murderer Who Hates Israel","More than 1,000 people packed Chicago’s International Union of Operating Engineers hall on August 12 for “A Farewell to Rasmea Odeh Featuring Angela Davis.” The event was described as a chance to say goodbye to Odeh, a convicted murderer who will soon be deported for lying to get U.S. citizenship.

Odeh masterminded a Palestinian terrorist group’s 1969 bombing of a Jerusalem supermarket that killed two Israeli college students. Her supporters on Saturday included dozens of progressive advocacy groups and anti-Israel organizations who sponsored the event, such as Code Pink, Jewish Voice for Peace, Students for Justice in Palestine and Black Lives Matter.

The convicted terrorist received well-wishers like the bride at a wedding and paused to meet children like a celebrity. Have your kid’s picture taken with a killer! Attendees appeared to be mostly young and of Middle Eastern descent. Quite a few of the women wore hijabs, but many others wore fully modern clothing. The room was generally young, energetic, organically diverse and united around a narrative that included a common enemy: Israel.

An Attorney Praised Odeh’s ‘Militancy’

Hatem Abudayyeh, executive director of the Arab American Action Network, began the program by welcoming Odeh and Davis. He then thanked Odeh for “her over 50 years of community organizing for the liberation of Palestine.” The bombing for which Odeh was convicted took place 48 years ago.

Odeh’s attorneys were honored and took the stage. Michael Deutsch, a Chicago attorney, said Odeh’s “militancy” had been an inspiration to him. At first, it seemed that word choice might have been a Freudian slip, but as he spoke, it became clear it wasn’t. Deutsch was the first speaker of the night to openly—if carefully—cast terrorism as morally acceptable. He was proud, he said, to “bring out in the federal court and in the public that the Israeli government systematically tortures political people… and most importantly, we were able to put forward the idea that Palestinians have the international law right to struggle against a brutal, illegal occupation by any means necessary.” The crowd cheered.

After a surprisingly good hip-hop act—with the usual messages of Israeli “apartheid,” mass murder, child execution and other crimes, as well as an opportunity for crowd participation by chanting the word “muqawama” (resistance)—the speeches continued. A woman from the Minnesota Committee to Stop FBI Repression spoke about the “injustices” of Odeh’s case and her own case from 2010. This was part of a theme of the evening—that American law enforcement and counter-terrorism efforts are racist and condemnable. The speaker never mentioned who was the U.S. president or attorney general in 2010.

Condemning Israel And Excusing Terrorism

Finally, Angela Davis was introduced. She gave the evening’s main indictment of Israel. Her speech was a disjointed mess of invective against the Jewish state, peppered with attempts to tie her Marxism and fringe non-sequiturs into condemnations of Israel. She criticized Israel for representing itself “as the paragon of democracy in the region. And specifically, the evidence it presents being that it is a haven for LGBTQ communities.”

This elicited a knowing groan from the crowd. Davis continued, “but Israel does not say that it is welcoming to queer Palestinians who call for justice for their people.” LGBTQ Palestinians do, in fact, seek refuge in Israel and often receive it. The cheering that followed her comment suggested this information was conveniently ignored. For a culture that literally kills LGBTQ individuals, that’s a curious argument to choose to go on offense.

While the cheering was muted somewhat when Davis claimed that attendees were gathered on stolen, colonized land (Chicago), it picked back up when she told the crowd that “Palestine, under Israeli occupation is certainly the worst possible example of a carceral society.” She name-checked—to thunderous applause—Assata Shakur, Mumia Abu-Jamal and Leonard Peltier. Odeh wasn’t the only killer the crowd was willing to celebrate.

By the time the woman of the hour was introduced, the crowd was ready for a different feel. Her speech was warm and personal. She left the anti-Israel invective to the previous speakers. But the repeated excuses for violence and terrorism left the impression that she not only has no remorse for her actions in 1969, but feels she is morally justified to be proud of them.

More Than 1,000 Cheered A Convicted Murderer

In the near future, Odeh will be deported from the U.S. The community represented at this event considers this one grave injustice among many perpetrated against them by a government—and society—that hates them. They are awash in victimhood and antipathy for the broader society in which they live.

It is easy and emotionally satisfying to dismiss them and their fringe ideas. But that is a mistake. More than 1,000 people gathered at a union hall in Chicago to cheer a convicted murderer. Ignoring that doesn’t make it go away. It lets it grow.

Trans Juggernaut Wants Your Kids. Public Schools Are Just The Beginning,"If you had argued pre-Obergefell that de-sexing marriage would lead to drag queens leading preschool storytime in public libraries and public schools hounded into hiding their mandatory sex ed curriculum from parents after a settlement requiring trans-friendly “education” starting in kindergarten, you would have been called an unhinged bigot. How could what two consenting adults do privately have any effect on whether five-year-olds are told they should consider cutting off their penises? Preposterous. Fear-mongering. Wild-eyed insanity.

School has started in my friend's city. Two kids in the second grade are transitioning. He's liberal, and wonders what the hell is going on. — Rod Dreher (@roddreher) August 16, 2017

Or not. Rod Dreher’s “Law of Merited Impossibility” strikes again: “It will never happen, and when it does, you bigots will deserve it.” As I’ve written before, Obergefell and related caselaw, which are still developing, are turning out not to be about what consenting adults do privately. They are the spear tip of a wholesale shift in law that is already negatively affecting children, because at its heart is the principle that sexuality is genderless.

As theologian N.T. Wright pointed out to the Times of London last week, “Nature…tends to strike back, with the likely victims in this case being vulnerable and impressionable youngsters who, as confused adults, will pay the price for their elders’ fashionable fantasies.”

This is likely why the transgender movement is targeting the young: They are vulnerable and impressionable, prepuberty pose better as either sex and therefore look less terrifying than adult transgenders, and once locked into the trans body morph will never truly be able to escape. Devastated people are prime candidates for exploitation by their pretend advocates. Also, locking in trans-policies now is a way to preclude debate before more extensive data and personal experience can fuel the inevitable backlash.

Of course this is bad for kids, but it’s not about kids. They’re just pawns, as usual. It’s about politics. Pushing transgenderism not only destabilizes a key component of a child’s identity but also contributes to early sexualization that is linked with mental illness and risky behaviors. Early exposure to and lack of clear parental direction about sex is also linked with increased gender confusion, which is precisely what we’re seeing as clinics for cutting and pasting children’s hormones and body parts explode inside a media environment that glamorizes this form of child abuse.

Parents are facing fewer and fewer ways to protect their children from being used as guinea pigs inside an experiment constructed by unelected bureaucrats. Here we’ll discuss two recent examples: one specific and one more general.

You Can’t Know What We’re Teaching Your Kids About Sex

Kelsey Harkness recently reported on the brewing situation at a public charter school in Minnesota. Charters are public schools often created and run by a board of a coalition of local parents and community leaders. Everyone who attends has to choose to do so rather than be assigned to attend automatically through geographic attendance zones, like most public schools. They usually provide a safe haven for families looking for a sound alternative to traditional schools, which are on average of lower academic quality because they do not have to compete for students.

Saint Paul’s Nova Classical Academy is ranked by U.S. News and World Report as the top Minnesota high school. But it has been transformed into a rainbow Trojan horse after Dave and Hannah Edwards sued Nova for not including pro-transgender materials starting in kindergarten to accommodate their five-year-old son, whom they claim is transgender. Parents began transferring their kindergarteners out of the child’s class when they came home saying things like, “Mom, I think you can choose if you want to be a boy or a girl,” according to interviews with The Daily Signal.

The little boy began wearing a female uniform and accessories, and classes began to include pro-trans picture books endorsing gender fluidity. This month’s settlement after 16 months of litigation requires the school to make all uniforms available to both sexes, pay LGBT organizations to “train staff” in politically correct behavior every three years, and “not adopt any gender policy that allows parents to opt out of requirements in the gender inclusion policy because of objections based on religion or conscience.” This lawyer and Federalist contributor, after reviewing the settlement, said it appears to ban the school from even notifying parents of its sex policies.

The settlement is actually broader than ""won't notify."" The school won't ""call attention"" means the school can't post the opt-out or if 1/2 — Margot Cleveland (@ProfMJCleveland) August 11, 2017

2/2 or learns of trans ""lessons""/affirmation can't even say to parents ""well you an opt out"" or even just point to the policy w/ wink & nod. — Margot Cleveland (@ProfMJCleveland) August 11, 2017

The circumstances are even more suspicious and shocking than a prohibition on telling parents what their children will be learning about human biology: Dave Edwards is an academic in the University of Minnesota’s Department of Psychology, whose pending PhD is being funded by a taxpayer-funded grant and who specializes in transgender education. As a school consultant and trainer on gender identity, he now personally profits from doing “training” of the kind his family’s settlement forces on Nova. Here’s from his website, GenderInclusiveSchools.com.

There are more curiosities in the family’s case. Edwards’ LinkedIn profile lists him as a “founding staff member of Venture Academy Charter School,” also in Saint Paul, a high-profile school funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which uses its deep pockets to seed “education reform” with far-left ideas and personnel. Edwards started his career in a heavily Gates-funded teaching fellowship known for its politically progressive staff.

Rather than enroll his son in the school Dave helped create, the Edwardses chose to apply for Nova at approximately the same time Dave stopped working at Venture Academy and began pursuing his doctorate with a focus on transgender school compliance. This was almost three years after the family decided the child was gender-fluid when he began emulating Beyonce’s dancing at two years old. In March 2016, after their son had attended Nova for seven months, the Edwardses withdrew him, but continued to press their lawsuit.

“The daily influence of this little boy, who very much looks like a girl, all the accessories … they’re really doing it up with him,” said a mother whose six-year-old was in kindergarten for those few months with the Edwardses’ son when he was five. Since lawsuit-induced policies have been adopted, Nova has lost a tenth of its students.

Nova Is Just a Tip of the Spear

Nova is a test case for what trans activists want to perpetuate nationwide — and not just in public schools, but also in private and home schools. An 8-year-old drag queen groomed by his parents says “If you want to be a drag queen and your parents don’t let you, you need new parents,” the underlying, totalitarian belief of the movement he represents. The easiest initial access point is private school choice programs, but activists are also targeting all private schools through accreditation bodies. The accreditation attack is currently most visible in higher education, but it’s spreading to K-12.

You read that right. Orthodox Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are morally equal to racists.

Since President Trump appointed school choice proponent Betsy DeVos as education secretary, Democrats have demanded to know why she supports giving parents freedom to choose their kids’s schools when so many hinterland bigots will choose schools that don’t let boys shower with girls or lie to developing minds about basic biology and its implications for their identity.

These questions led to a media divebomb this summer on a Christian school in Indiana that accepts voucher students and whose policies reflect the Ten Commandments’ prohibition against sexual immorality. Subsequently, Indiana outlets have begun investigating which in-state private schools are “anti-LGBT,” meaning require students to adhere to centuries-old prescriptions for chastity that apply to those of all sexual attractions.

Through reviews of publicly posted handbooks and phone calls, journalism nonprofit Chalkbeat Indiana found 27 “anti-LGBT” schools and created a comprehensive database of in-state private schools’ sexuality and admissions policies. Just in case, you know, rainbow protesters wanted to show up at a few, or know where to enroll their gender-dysphoric kindergarteners and then sue.

It also quoted a professor who says “allowing some schools to discriminate against LGBT students on the basis of religion is no different than racial discrimination.” You read that right. Orthodox Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are morally equal to racists. It’s not surprising, then, that in this political environment about 80 percent of Indiana private schools keep their sex policies off the Internet and don’t return reporters’ phone calls to reveal them.

In Indiana, private schools must be accredited by either the state or one of seven private accreditors approved by the state board of education to accept students through one of the state’s two private choice programs. Chalkbeat, another Gates Foundation grant recipient, singled out the Association of Christian Schools International, an organization with 3,000 member schools, for offering a sample sexual ethics policy that repeats standard Christian teachings about the proper use of sexuality — within marriage between two opposite-sex people.

Discrimination Based on Behavior Is Not Like Racism

Chalkbeat referred to sex-specific policies and safeguards as “discrimination,” implying an equivocation between racial discrimination and behavior expectations. But race is an immutable fact, not a behavior. This is one of the reasons discrimination on its basis is so unjust. Yet we as a society discriminate based on behavior all the time, and we must to stay civilized, as well as to preserve our constitutionally guaranteed rights to free exercise of religion and freedom of association.

None of us are safe unless we band together and stop this crazy train in its tracks.

We sometimes treat the sexes distinctly, and create special, sometimes separate, environments for those who are emotionally troubled. There are sensible reasons for these that are not in the same ballpark as racism. The leftists harping on this topic are essentially demanding a religious litmus test — the adoption of the moral belief that every sexual practice must be affirmed — as a precondition for educating children. It is starting with public and private schools, but will eventually encompass “outliers” such as homeschoolers. None of us are safe unless we band together and stop this crazy train in its tracks.

A key problem is that Republican-led statehouses are the ones guarding school choice programs, and these same statehouses can barely muster the votes to protect children in public schools from being forced into unisex shower and sleeping quarters. Just two days ago Texas Speaker Joe Strauss torpedoed a special session that was set to consider both a bathroom bill and a school choice bill, and the state is in desperate need of both. Despite the lack of federal laws banning sexuality-based policies even when rational, such as in public showers and sports competitions, courts are already busy writing this religious (and antiscientific and inhumane) litmus test into existing sexual-privileges laws for women.

Chalkbeat put its recent set of articles on these topics under the heading “Choice for Some.” It’s an ironic slogan given that the logical end of their rhetoric is choice for none. Eradicating all social and ethical policies based on the distinctions between the sexes herds everyone into an Potemkin genderless society whether we consent to that arrangement or not. Some may feel that’s progress; others may call it totalitarianism.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/08/17/trans-juggernaut-wants-kids-public-schools-just-beginning/,2017-08-17
Pro Sports To Christians: ‘We Don’t Want Your Kind Around Here’,"The rapid mainstreaming of homosexuality now has a powerful ally, whose most important employees could find themselves choosing between their consciences and their careers. Professional sports, both individual teams and entire leagues, seek to enhance their brands by connecting promotions with the LGBT movement’s Pride campaign. Teams organize “Pride Nights,” including rainbow-themed merchandise, not only as marketing tools but as signs of their acquiescence to leftist views of social justice.

The National Basketball Association embraces those views. The league and its subsidiary, the Women’s National Basketball Association, became the first professional leagues to have a float in New York’s Pride March. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver not only stood on the float this year but waved a rainbow flag and threw themed towels to the crowd. Some attendees wore black T-shirts with the NBA emblem or team emblems in rainbow colors, which were sold through the NBA’s website.

Silver demonstrated his commitment in July 2016 by moving the 2017 All-Star Game to New Orleans from Charlotte after the North Carolina legislature passed a measure that included prohibiting transsexuals from using public restrooms not corresponding to their biological sex. Two months later, the NCAA and the Atlantic Coast Conference moved scheduled championship events out of the state. One week before Silver’s appearance at the Pride March, baseball’s New York Mets staged their own “Pride Night,” complete with a color guard carrying a rainbow flag and scoreboard videos of same-sex couples in the stands kissing.

I Can’t Condone Things My Faith Says Are Wrong

The United States Soccer Federation had the national women’s team wear jerseys with rainbow-decorated numerals for June matches in Norway and Sweden. Two of the team’s biggest stars, Megan Rapinoe and the now-retired Abby Wambach, are lesbians.

One Christian athlete, however, took exception. Jaeline Hinkle, a defender for the North Carolina Courage in the National Women’s Soccer League, who played for the United States eight times, left the national team for “personal reasons,” a release stated, two weeks after the federation announced its plan for the jerseys. When the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in 2015, Hinkle wrote this tweet: “This world is falling farther and farther away from God… All that can be done by believers is to continue to pray.”

Hinkle elaborated on her Instagram page: “I believe with every fiber in my body that what was written 2,000 years ago in the Bible is undoubtedly true. It’s not a fictional book. It’s not a pick and choose what you want to believe. … My heart is that as Christians we don’t begin to throw a tantrum over what has been brought into law today, but we become that much more loving. That through our love, the lost, rejected, and abandoned find Christ.”

Hinkle’s position creates a dilemma for Christians in professional sports: Should openly Christian athletes capitulate to the mores of the current Zeitgeist or risk confrontation with the fans and the teams that pay their salaries?

‘An Obligation to Stand for What I Believe Is Right’

Lance Berkman, an outspoken evangelical during his baseball career, also confronted that dilemma. Berkman, who played nearly 11 seasons for the Houston Astros, made advertisements in 2015 against that city’s Proposition 1. That measure, which gave special legal preferences based on sexual practices, also could be used to require transsexuals to use restrooms of their choice. Proposition 1 lost 61 percent to 39 percent.

“All of the stuff that is good about the ordinance is already protected federally, so what’s the point of foisting this ordinance on our city?” Berkman told Houston radio host Michael Berry. ”The only answer that I could come up with it that it’s an LGBT-agenda type of thing. I’m not (for) depriving anybody of their civil rights. But by the same token, the ordinance is so poorly written.”

Why would a retired player even bother? “First of all, as a Christian, I feel like I have an obligation to take a stand for what I believe is right,” Berkman told Berry. “I’m not about pushing my belief system on other people. But I am about articulating my belief system and taking a stand on it when I have the opportunity.”

Two years later, Berkman’s stance still reverberates. The St. Louis Cardinals received criticism for allowing Berkman, who played two years for them, to speak at that team’s “Christian Day” on July 30, three weeks before the club’s “Pride Night.”

The Most Popular Religion In the World Is ‘Bigoted’

Landon Brownfield, co-chairman of PrideCenter of St. Louis, said in a statement that his organization offered to help the Cardinals “promote love, diversity, and inclusion” while calling Berkman “an individual whose words and actions towards the LGBTQ+ are divisive and demeaning.”

A writer for SB Nation’s “Beyond the Box Score” expressed her opposition more emphatically.

“The Cardinals hosting a pride night while continuing to support Berkman is the ultimate ‘sorry if you were offended’ non-apology,” Mary Craig wrote. “[T]hey are telling all of their LGBT fans that they are unwelcome in the Cardinals community, that what so many view as an escape or as a way to cope with the hatred they face is now yet another place telling them they shouldn’t exist.”

Contrast that opinion of Berkman’s remarks with his comments to Berry.

“Anything short of a full condemnation of Berkman’s stance on LGBT issues is an open endorsement of them and a message to the LGBT community that the Cardinals do not care about them except as PR devices,” Craig continued. “There is no such thing as toleration when it forces you to shake hands with a bigot. It should not be up to LGBT youth to constantly reach across the aisle to make peace with people who view their existence as a perceived threat while actually threatening LGBT people.”

Craig’s comments reflect the hysterical, self-righteous propaganda undergirding the LGBT movement. Thoughtful opposition is forbidden. Personal reservations are forbidden. Even legitimate questions about societal consequences are forbidden. The message is clear: Conform or else.

Why The Solution To School Trans Indoctrination Is Withdrawing Your Kids,"Last week brought news of three troubling incidents entangling children as young as five in the ever-sprawling transgender agenda. First, as The Federalist’s Joy Pullmann detailed, a California charter school, Rocklin Academy, began the school year with the kindergarten teacher reading students a book about transgenderism.

After story-time ended, a male classmate suffering from gender dysphoria changed clothing and reappeared in a “gender reveal” as his “real” self—a “girl.” Parents only learned of the “lesson” when their confused and upset five-year-olds returned home that day. The parents showed up in force at their school board meeting to chastise the administrators for failing to inform them of the planned events or offer them the opportunity to opt their children out.

A few days after this news broke, Rod Dreher shared details of a similar experience relayed by parents of a Washington DC charter school first grader. Dreher reprinted an email exchange between the school’s principal and student’s parents. The parents reached out after discovering that, without their knowledge, their daughter’s teacher had read the class the transgender picture book “I Am Jazz,” then discussed transgenderism with the young pupils.

‘I Will Not Exempt Any Child’

In the initial email to the principal, one of the parents explained: “[Our daughter] was confused by the discussion and book, and it required me to spend 20 minutes just to undo the odd and incorrect conclusions she drew about transgendered individuals from [the teacher’s] lesson and even the storyline of the book.” The parents expressed their disappointment and sought reassurance that they would be informed ahead of time of future “lessons” so they could opt their first-grader out.

After several back-and-forths and delays, the principal finally responded with a direct denial of their request: “I will not exempt any child from classroom discussions or instruction relating to the topics of gender identity, and ‘marital norms’.” The parents withdrew that child and an older one from the school, but did not want to publicly identify the school or themselves.

The week ended with yet another incident, back at Rocklin Academy: As Todd Starnes reported for Fox News, “during the first week of school…a first grader came across a classmate on the playground. She called the student by his given name – apparently unaware that the boy now identified as a girl.”

Karen England, with Capitol Resource Institute, a California-based public policy group assisting several Rocklin Academy parents, told Starnes: “This innocent little first grader sees a classmate, calls him by the name she knew him last year and the boy reports it to a teacher. The little girl gets in trouble on the playground and then gets called out of class to the principal’s office.” According to the Washington Times, “The little girl was told ‘you can’t do that, his name is this name,’ and ‘you need to call him a “her.”’

After an hour-long “investigation,” the principal determined the first grader had not bullied the transgender child by calling him by his birth name and she was not punished. But she went home from school crying, telling her mom she “got in trouble at school today.” The girl’s mother immediately called the school and “was told that whenever there is a pronoun mishap with this biological boy who now claims to be a girl—the school must investigate,” according to Starnes’ article.

What Are Parents’ Options?

With these stories in the news, parents understandably wonder what, if any, rights they have to protect their children from being taught in school that boys can become girls, or girls can turn into boys; and from being investigated or punished for “misgendering” a child when using the biologically correct pronoun for a child suffering from gender-dysphoria.

There is much to be written on this topic. The initial issue of import, though, concerns whether parents have the right to opt their child out of school lessons, discussions, or coverage of transgenderism or “gender identity.” Here are some preliminary thoughts on this question based on my current academic research for a work-in-progress article tentatively titled “Parental Rights, Free Speech, and Religious Freedom in K-12 Public Schools in the Transgender Era.”

Whether parents will have a right to opt their children out of “gender identity” lessons depends on the governing provisions of state law. Every state regulates public education, and in most states, parents may opt their children out of “sex-education” classes. Whether a discussion of “gender identity” and “transgenderism” would qualify as “sex education” depends on the specific statute.

Most States Have No Opt-Out Laws

My initial research indicates that the various statutory definitions of “sex education” contained in opt-out provisions focus on sexual reproduction and thus would not cover classroom discussions of gender identity. Further, some states, such as California, expressly provide that “gender identity” is not subject to the statutory opt-out provisions available to parents for comprehensive sex education.

At the other end of the spectrum are laws, such the law in New Hampshire, which allows parents to opt their children out of any specific course material that families find objectionable; parents, though, must pay for other instruction, as necessary, to meet the mandates of state law.

In the middle are states that do not provide for a right to opt-out of class coverage of gender identity, but also do not prohibit local school boards or individual schools from offering parents that choice. However, parents should recognize that if a transgender child attends the school, lawyers representing that child will likely demand that to protect the child from bullying, the school must not offer an opt-out option. Schools are extremely likely to comply with such legal demands.

Closely related is the question of whether a school will notify parents of coverage of gender-identity issues in the classroom. Most states require schools to provide parents notice only for curriculum discussions related to “sex education.” But schools are generally not prohibited from notifying parents of an upcoming discussion or event that is potentially controversial. A school, thus, may inform parents of an upcoming gender-identity discussion; however, as the examples above illustrate, there is no guarantee that parents will learn of the event before it transpires and if lawyers are involved, they may attempt to prevent the schools from providing notice.

Nonetheless, most states have passed statutes granting parents the right to review curriculum material. Prudent parents should consider asking to review any curriculum involving gender identity or transgenderism.

Legal Precedent Gives Parents No Opt-Out Rights

If the state’s education code does not provide an opt-out provision for discussions of gender-identity, the question then becomes whether there is a constitutional or other statutory opt-out right. Given the current landscape of the law, the most likely answer is “no.”

This conclusion may come as a shock to most parents, given the Supreme Court’s trilogy of cases establishing the constitutional dimension of parental rights. In Meyer v. Nebraska, the Supreme Court held the liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause includes the right of parents to “establish a home and bring up children” and “to control the education of their own.”

In Pierce v. Society of Sisters, the Supreme Court reiterated that the “liberty of parents and guardians” includes the right “to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control.” Then in Prince v. Massachusetts, the Supreme Court proclaimed: “It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder.”

While the Supreme Court has made clear parents possess a constitutional right to guide the upbringing and education of their children, that right has never been extended to provide parents a right to opt children out of public school curriculum. Rather, two federal appellate courts have rejected this argument. In Mozert v. Hawkins County Board of Education, the Sixth Circuit held parents did not have a constitutional right to opt their daughter out of a reading curriculum that required students to read stories about telekinetic and magical powers. And in Brown v. Hot, Sexy and Safer Productions, Inc., the First Circuit held parents did not have a constitutional right to opt their son out of an explicit sex education course conducted at his high school.

In rejecting the parents’ claimed opt-out right, the court in Brown explained its reasoning, as follows:

The state does not have the power to ‘standardize its children’ or ‘foster a homogenous people’ by completely foreclosing the opportunity of individuals and groups to choose a different path of education. We do not think, however, that this freedom encompasses a fundamental constitutional right to dictate the curriculum at the public school to which they have chosen to send their children. We think it is fundamentally different for the state to say to a parent, ‘You can’t teach your child German or send him to a parochial school,’ than for the parent to say to the state, ‘You can’t teach my child subjects that are morally offensive to me.’ The first instance involves the state proscribing parents from educating their children, while the second involves parents prescribing what the state shall teach their children. If all parents had a fundamental constitutional right to dictate individually what the schools teach their children, the schools would be forced to cater a curriculum for each student whose parents had genuine moral disagreements with the school’s choice of subject matter. We cannot see that the Constitution imposes such a burden on state educational systems, and accordingly find that the rights of parents … do not encompass a broad-based right to restrict the flow of information in the public schools.

Given this precedent, it is unlikely a parent will succeed in arguing for a constitutionally protected parental right to opt children out of gender-identity course work.

Further, while the U.S. Constitution guarantees citizens the right to freely exercise their religion, under Supreme Court precedent (in most circumstances), there is no right to be excused from generally applicable laws. Thus, it is unlikely a court would hold that a family has a right to opt-out of gender identity course material based on their religious beliefs and the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause.

Current Religious Freedom Laws Are Too Weak, Also

Finally, while approximately 20 states have adopted statutes protecting religious freedom, to obtain relief under these laws parents would need to prove the school’s curriculum imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of their religious beliefs. Courts will be unlikely to find that merely learning about “gender identity” and “transgenderism” imposes a substantial burden on religion.

Courts will be unlikely to find that merely learning about ‘gender identity’ and ‘transgenderism’ imposes a substantial burden on religion.

The key take-aways, then: There is no constitutional or statutory opt-out right, unless the state education code creates such a right. Only a few states do: New Hampshire, Texas, and Minnesota. However, school boards or individual schools might voluntarily offer parents an opt-out. Schools may also voluntarily inform parents of upcoming coverage of “gender identity,” but it is not required in the majority of states, and trans students’ lawyers fight these accomodations. Most states, though, guarantee parents a right to review the school’s curriculum, upon request.

At this point, if parents wish to shelter their children from the transgender agenda beginning to permeate the public school system, parents’ best choice will be to lobby states for a legislative expansion of the sex-education opt-out provisions, or to push the local school board to provide such a right.

However, parents must decide whether to subject their family to the battle-wounds likely to result from challenging the LGBT agenda. Lobbying either politicians or school board members is time-consuming, usually takes years of a child’s school career and ultimately fails, and in challenging the orthodoxy of transgender activists, families and their young children will likely face vicious public criticism, name-calling, doxxing, and more.

Opting Out of Public Schools Can’t Opt You Out of America

Private education or homeschooling may prove a more attractive alternative. But before making that choice, parents should also keep in mind that if they retreat from this fight, their children will merely face the same dogma later—at college, in the workplace, and in life—and by then, the population at large will have been socially conditioned to unquestioningly accept the gospel of gender-identity.

While their ignorance does not make it right to thrust gender-identity idolatry on our children, compassion should caution against vitriol.

Parents might instead decide to teach their children the truth at home while they continue to receive their formal education through the public-school system. However, parents who choose this option should craft a plan to avoid confrontations in school, keeping in mind that while a school may teach children gender-identity theory, it cannot require them to believe or profess a belief contrary to their faith, or punish them if they refuse to do so (i.e., if they “misgender” the transgendered child). This also presents peer-pressure and contradicting authorities difficulties for children, who are psychologically vulnerable by virtue of their immaturity. A follow-up article will discuss these points in more detail.

No matter which option parents choose, they should keep another point in mind: The school and transgender children and their families are not the enemy. Schools must legally protect children in their care and many state laws specifically include gender identity in their anti-discrimination laws. Families with transgendered children often enlist lawyers and LGBT activists to force schools to teach other students to affirm the dysphoric child’s gender-identity. And schools often believe they must do so, without allowing any student to opt-out, to comply with state and federal regulations.

Further, while some families may push a transgender agenda on their child, most children truly suffer from gender dysphoria and most parents’ sole interest is protecting their children. And most parents have doctors who have told them, as if it were settled science, that the proper treatment is gender affirmation. Most parents also do not know that a majority of children presenting as gender-confused or gender-dysphoric grow up to accept their true sex. While their ignorance does not make it right to thrust gender-identity idolatry on our children, compassion should caution against vitriol against the parents and school administrators, and most definitely against the suffering child.

Why ‘Fairness For All’ Legislation Actually Produces More Discrimination,"In July the U.S. Supreme Court announced it will hear the case of Jack Phillips, the cake artist in Denver whom the government ordered to “re-educate” his staff and file quarterly “compliance” reports for two years after he made a conscience-based decision not to create a custom cake for a same-sex wedding ceremony.

Jack’s case and the underlying issue—whether the First Amendment still protects the artistic freedom of creative professionals or is subject to the whims and demands of government officials—are sure to increase the attention paid to controversial “Fairness for All” legislation.

But first, a prefatory note: Lest your initial reaction to the legislation’s title be one of rapturous applause—finally, a law that takes everyone into account—remember that such monikers aren’t crafted to inform the public, but to persuade it. The “Affordable Care Act,” “Restoring Internet Freedom Act,” and the “USA Patriot Act” come to mind.

As Adam Liptak wrote in The New York Times, the old “boring names” have been replaced by “cute names,” ones that “seem focus-group tested.” Why not? As writer Harold Pinter once said, “It’s so easy for propaganda to work, and dissent to be mocked.”

Its cuddly name aside, careful study of “Fairness for All” legislation reveals that the proposed legislation is poorly conceived, demonstrably unfair, and wholly incapable of achieving its aims.

SOGI Laws Aim to Correct A Nonexistent Problem

To understand this new proposed legislation, we must first understand its ancestry. Such legislation is the immediate descendent of SOGI laws (laws that add the new classifications of sexual orientation and gender identity to existing “nondiscrimination” laws). I provide a more thorough explanation here, but in short, while SOGI laws purport to combat discrimination, in effect, they threaten every American’s constitutionally guaranteed freedoms. The operative word is “purport,” because available data reveals that systematic, widespread denial of housing, employment, or services to individuals who identify as LGBT doesn’t exist.

So without a significant, unresolved problem to address, these laws have functioned as Trojan horses, empowering governments to personally and professionally destroy individuals who seek to peacefully live and work in a manner consistent with their consciences (but at odds with the government’s views). One of the ways these laws operate is to silence those who hold to millennia-old views of marriage—views that the Supreme Court acknowledged in Obergefell are held “in good faith by reasonable and sincere people.”

Barronelle Stutzman is a prime example: This 72-year-old grandmother faces the loss of her business, savings, and home for declining a request by a long-time friend and customer to participate in the celebration of his same-sex wedding by designing custom floral arrangements.

Similarly, while Phillips gladly welcomes and serves anyone who enters his bakery, he can’t celebrate all events or convey all messages. In fact, Jack has a longstanding custom of not designing certain cakes that express messages with which he disagrees, such as cakes that celebrate Halloween, or contain racist, Anti-American, or vulgar messages. Ironically, the same Colorado commission that ruled against Jack held that three other nearby bakeries had the freedom to decline to design cakes with messages that criticized same-sex marriage.

Others who have faced personal and professional ruin because of these laws include Elaine Huguenin, Carl and Angel Larsen, and Blaine Adamson. These small business owners gladly serve people from all walks of life but choose not to participate in certain events or create custom art that would violate their consciences. Elaine’s desire to remain true to her faith led to a seven-year court battle that culminated in a New Mexico Supreme Court ruling against her and her husband, Jon. One justice stated that the Huguenins “now are compelled by law to compromise the very religious beliefs that inspire their lives” and added that this compulsion “is the price of citizenship.”

Recognizing the harmful effects of SOGI laws and lack of redeeming qualities, legislatures from no fewer than 15 states rejected such legislation in 2016 alone. Utah is the only state to pass a statewide SOGI law in the last six years, and its legislature did so because they believed a lie about SOGI laws—that such legislation was “fair.”

The Orwellian Nature of Unfair ‘Fairness for All’ Laws

Proponents of Fairness for All legislation don’t dispute the harm that can result from SOGI laws. Instead, they claim that SOGIs are inevitable, and therefore state legislatures must seek to mitigate those harms by inserting limited exemptions.

But these exemptions are nothing more than feeble deflections. They set forth who may enjoy constitutionally guaranteed freedoms and who may not. Laws like Utah’s, which its proponents trumpet as a model for other states, set forth only the most basic of First Amendment protections for a small subset of the population, leaving all others vulnerable and subject to lawsuits.

Suffice it to say, such laws do not bolster constitutionally protected freedoms for everyone. Instead, they empower the government to target viewpoints with which it disagrees, and invite activist courts to strip away the constitutional rights of individuals and organizations not explicitly exempted from the law. As I write elsewhere, such a voluntary surrender of fundamental freedoms is hardly a model fit for replication.

‘Fairness for All’ Legislation Disappoints Everyone

Another argument proponents make regarding legislation like the Utah SOGI is that it will satisfy both sides. In reality, it satisfies neither LGBT activists nor defenders of freedom, conscience, and true diversity. When Indiana introduced legislation similar to the Utah SOGI, Lambda Legal’s law and policy director, Jennifer Pizer, described the bill as “a wolf in sheep’s clothing” and argued it “aims to guarantee the right . . . to discriminate” and provides “lesser protections for LGBT people.”

Other LGBT groups were similarly dismissive and called for eliminating any religious liberty protections in future bills, even ones so basic as allowing religious institutions to adopt and enforce policies reflecting the core tenets of their faith on matters pertaining to marriage and human sexuality. Less than a year after the signing of the Utah SOGI law, activists introduced new legislation in Utah to strip away what little freedom the law left untouched.

Prominent religious and thought leaders are also unimpressed by the proposed legislation. More than 75 have signed a statement entitled “Preserve Freedom, Reject Coercion,” which “affirms every American’s freedom to peacefully live their lives according to their beliefs and opposes government coercion or censorship of fellow citizens who have different views.”

Proponents of “Fairness for All” legislation claim to desire a tolerant society, but true tolerance means respecting every person’s viewpoints and beliefs, even those with whom they disagree. It also means respecting constitutionally guaranteed freedoms and refusing to empower the government to demand that Americans sacrifice our national birthright. Freedom of conscience is not a token to be surrendered as the price of citizenship in a free society; it is the mark of citizenship and the fruit of a free society.

Why ‘Wicked’ Is A Sneaky Story That Celebrates A Free Society,"Spoiler alert: discusses plot points from a 14-year-old musical.

It can be challenging being a conservative fan of Broadway musicals. When I was growing up on Long Island in the ’80s and ’90s, I would regularly go to see Broadway shows with my family or on school trips. Perhaps it was just my perception, but it seemed to me that the vast majority of shows had broad appeal, despite the proposition of heading in to the gritty city—Times Square hadn’t been cleaned up yet.

Despite the seedy surroundings of Midtown Manhattan, you could take the family to most of the shows. Back then, we would snicker at well-placed expletives in shows like “Les Miserables.” Today, Times Square is safer than ever (barring the occasional aggressive Elmo), but you really have to do your homework to know which shows you can take your kids to. Generally speaking, unless the show is a classic revival (like “Fiddler on the Roof” or “West Side Story”); has been adapted by Disney (“Lion King,” “Aladdin,” etc.); or it’s explicitly marketed to kids (like “Matilda”), you’re probably better off staying home.

Broadway shows these days seem to revel in saturating in swearwords or rubbing the audience’s faces in the latest feminist or LGBT agenda item. (And yes, I realize that people like Bob Fosse were pushing the envelope in the ’70s, and shows like “Oh Calcutta” existed in the ’80s.) It’s enough to make you give up on professional live theater.

That brings me to “Wicked.” Here is your show of shows. It’s a blockbuster that has been continually running on Broadway since it opened 14 years ago. It’s smashed box office records many times over at its home at the Gershwin Theater. It’s broken box office records with its touring productions. It confirmed Broadway superstar status for its stars, Kristin Chenowith and Idina Menzel. Somehow I missed it. I think I just wasn’t convinced by the hype, and I had heard it got political, so I had stayed away.

A Reimagining of ‘The Wizard of Oz’

In Philadelphia, where I now live, touring productions of “Wicked” have visited five times over the years, and they have generally stayed for week-long runs. I always had something better to do. The most recent touring production took up a residence during the entire month of August at the Academy of Music, and I figured this was finally the time to see it. And I loved it!

In case you’re still with me, and you don’t know what “Wicked” is all about, it’s a musical based on the novel of the same name. It reimagines the novel and movie “The Wizard of Oz.” “Wicked” takes place before, during, and after the events of “Wizard.” In this reimagining, Glinda and Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, are friends who met as roommates in college in Oz. “Wicked” purports to give us the back story behind the flying monkeys, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion. It turns out that Elphaba didn’t really melt after Dorothy threw that bucket of water.

I was quite suspicious of it going in, because I sensed, from reading reviews, that it had a political slant. And the first few moments of the performance were a bit uncomfortable. However, I soon realized that there is a blue-pill way of viewing “Wicked.” That’s what most people will come away with, and probably what the creators of the musical intended. Broadway, and the theater community in general, is notoriously friendly to progressive, feminist, LGBT themes. However, there is a red-pill way to view “Wicked,” and once you start viewing it this way, you can’t un-see it.

All Their Points Turn Back on Themselves

Consider the character of Elphaba. She has green skin, and once she reaches college, is constantly made the butt of jokes throughout the show. She’s graceless and outspoken, and becomes an animal rights activist. She can be thus seen as a stand-in for whatever group of people are being victimized, bullied, and shamed—LGBT, overweight, or racial or religious minorities. However, that reading of Elphaba’s character isn’t mandatory. Who is being shamed and bullied in the public square these days by cultural gatekeepers?

Another example comes later in act one, when a history professor in the musical is dismissed from his job and arrested. These days, who is being driven from their jobs? Certainly not progressives. They’re running the show. People losing their jobs due to conscience issues are people who contribute to the wrong political campaigns (Brendan Eich) or write memos questioning ideological echo chambers (James Damore). People are losing their bakeries and flower shops due to conscience issues. And one of the authorities in the musical who is arresting that history professor explicitly claims to be on the side of progress! The kicker is that as the professor is being dragged away, he yells out, “You’re not being told the whole truth!”

One of the antagonists of the musical, Madame Morrible, becomes a press secretary for the Wizard of Oz, who is responsible for churning out fake news in the vein of CNN! At that point, I really started wondering if this is a conservative-friendly musical in disguise. So many of its themes are actually conservative themes.

For example, the progressives in the musical are busy trying to silence voices and reduce controversies to black and white Manichean categories. In the real world, conservatives these days are the ones who realize that people are complex, and evil resides in every heart, which is why government should be limited. It’s conservatives and libertarians who are defending the classically liberal right to free speech. What do you hear from illiberal leftists these days? Not “I disagree with what you say but will defend to the death your right to say it,” but “Shut up, bigot!”

Who in the real world is dividing up the world into Manichean categories? It seems to me it is the illiberal left that is interested in eliminating any hint of nuance in public life. It is the illiberal left that attacks even its purported allies in classical liberal circles for not being sufficiently ideologically pure. By contrast, “Wicked” recognizes that life and motivations are messy. “Wicked” turns the uninformed masses into an antagonist thatis easily whipped into a frenzy. But they don’t have all the facts. The audience is given all the facts and asked to make a moral choice: is Elphaba really as “wicked” as everyone says? Here, for certain, is some red-pilling.

Generally speaking, works of art should be apolitical mirrors that show us distilled deeper truth than we usually see in daily life. So it is with “Wicked.” For the moment, “Wicked” has renewed my hope that conservatives can still enjoy theater.

Why It’s Ironic That LGBT Groups Are Complaining About Title IX,"College Pride recently released its “Shame List” of colleges that are the “absolute worst campuses for LGBTQ youth” in the United States. These schools supposedly discriminate against LGBTQ people and have requested federal exemptions to “perpetuate the harms of religion-based bigotry.” That’s how Campus Pride interprets schools’ desire to, say, maintain single-sex dormitories and showers, or teach that man-woman marriage is God’s design.

Campus Pride and the LGBTQ lobby rip on private schools for opting out of provisions of Title IX that would otherwise require them to endorse sexual behavior that conflicts with their religious beliefs, although Americans have a constitutionally guaranteed right to free exercise of religion. Most ironically, LGBT lobbyists even abuse Title IX themselves by demanding legal interpretations of it that would destroy women’s higher-education advantages, which the law exists to promote.

To understand the irony of Campus Pride berating schools for opting out of Title IX, or even how it relates to transgender students at all, one must delve deeper into that particular aspect of the Education Amendments Act of 1972. It was originally written in following the Civil Rights Act of 1974 and aimed at sex disparities in higher education.

Title IX states: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” Although Title IX has since been known primarily for its effects on sports in high school and college settings due to interpretations of it essentially giving women preferences above men, there is no mention of sports in the original text.

Let Men Into Women’s Spaces Or Else

Some transgender people, of course, attempt to approximate femininity despite their male sex. Doing so while a college student, then, confers on men Title IX perks aimed at women, particularly in two areas: safety and sports. Further, the trans lobby is arguing in court and regulatory agencies that the word “sex” in Title IX should instead be understood as “gender,” giving transgender people the special privileges under the law without having to get Congress to actually change the law to encompass transgender people.

For example, a group called Safe Spaces for Women, which “provides survivors of sexual assault with care, support, understanding, and advice,” submitted an amicus brief to the Supreme Court, explained how Title IX regulatory changes transgender lobbyists want can harm women: “While Safe Spaces for Women bears no animus toward the transgendered community, it is deeply concerned that … survivors of sexual assault are likely to suffer psychological trauma as a result of encountering biological males—even those with entirely innocent intentions—in the traditional safe spaces of women’s showers, locker rooms, and bathrooms.”

These fears are not unfounded. There are numerous examples of men taking advantage of transgendered facilities to surreptitiously record women in locker rooms and restrooms. By allowing people to use the restrooms, locker rooms, and similar facilities of their choice, it creates an environment that can be hostile to women and open up pathways for abuse. Traditionally that would be grounds for a Title IX complaint on women’s behalf. But trans activists like Campus Pride are trying to use a law meant to protect women to instead strip women’s legal protections.

Men Using Women’s Advantages Against Them

There’s also a distinct athletic advantage for men who transition to women and play on high school and collegiate teams. It’s so clear one would have to be blind not to see how fraudulent this is, given men’s innately greater physical strength compared to women. Female-to-male transgender Mack Beggs made waves earlier this year because she won two girls’ wrestling championships in Texas while taking testosterone. It’s easy to see why testosterone injections might give someone an advantage over female competitors in wrestling.

The same thing happened this year with transgender sprinter Andraya Yearwood, who was born a male but won two races in the girls’ state championships as a transgender person. This story too created controversy and invoked a sense of inequality and unfairness. If a young person still has male body parts but is calling himself a girl and competing against girls, how could he not enjoy a physical advantage? This is an abuse of Title IX, to be sure, although the LGBTQ community is hard-pressed to admit it.

There’s actually already a huge debate about whether transgender people can even use Title IX to their advantage. After all, the text specifically uses the word “sex,” not “gender.” While in the past typically most of the public would have agreed biology dictates one’s gender, today many would like to propagate the myth that gender is fluid and a person’s sex is a personal choice detached from biological reality. So far, several transgender people have successfully sued companies and organizations to claim discrimination under Title IX, even though it’s an unprecedented legal stretch.

We Just Want to Live the Way We Believe

To avoid getting tangled up in the issues presented above, many faith-based colleges opt out of Title IX altogether. A cursory glance at Campus Pride’s list reveals many of these schools are faith-based. Many have either opted out of Title IX after being granted exemptions or are actively “against” LGBTQ views of sex and gender, both largely due to religious reasons.

Schools such Criswell College in Old East Dallas, Texas, and The Baptist College of Florida in Graceville boast enrollment sizes of fewer than 700 students. Their degree programs are built around curricula designed around ministry, Christian studies, and biblical studies. This might not be everyone’s cup of tea but neither is it harmful, just different—some might even say healthy, imperative, and a religious right.

Many of these institutions believe homosexuality is a sin and that while legal in the United States, gay marriage is not acceptable under Christian doctrine, thus they innately oppose the LGBTQ agenda. Similarly, a hard-core vegan might not go to a butcher’s or show her children how to cook steak because she’s vehemently opposed to eating animal products, even though both of these are legal activities: It’s not bigotry but a belief system.

To function in accord with their deepest beliefs and protect their students, especially women, these schools have opted out of Title IX via exemptions. Schools don’t have the flexibility to opt out for any reason they choose—exemptions are largely granted for religious reasons. With more than 5,300 colleges and universities in the United States, Campus Pride is engaging in a form of bigotry, targeting schools simply because they’re choosing to educate based on core beliefs that happen to have a basis in religion.

Peak Privilege

At first the LGBTQ movement promised same-sex marriage and “bathroom debates” were merely measures to ensure equality. Fast-forward a few years, and it’s clear they were nothing but paving the way to create preferences that give LGBT politics the power to trump any decision in which their desires conflict with others’ rights and beliefs.

The United States is a tolerant nation and, more often than not, people are willing to accommodate others. Unfortunately, there is a segment of society that doesn’t want accommodation. They want capitulation. They don’t want equality; they want privilege.

Campus Pride and other like-minded groups are not interested in access, accommodation, or even equality, but about shutting down dissenting voices and using the law as a sword rather than a shield. There is no better example than a group attempting to use Title IX to their advantage, but which then tries to eviscerate others who would opt out of Title IX because they feel it might hinder their ability to practice their own beliefs.

5 Big Fat Myths About LGBT Business Discrimination Laws,"Remember how LGBT activists promised that same-sex marriage would harm no one and infringe on no one’s freedoms? They lied.

Christians and other nonconformists now face financial ruin and even imprisonment if they decline to participate in promoting and celebrating same-sex wedding ceremonies. Consider baker Jack Phillips and florist Barronelle Stutzman, who faithfully serve LGBT customers in the ordinary course of business, balking only at custom work that conflicts with their deeply held religious convictions. For this, the LGBT left seeks to destroy their businesses.

The Supreme Court has now taken up Jack’s case, to decide whether the government can force artists to create against their will, and whether it can compel religious dissenters and other nonconformists to participate in promoting and celebrating ceremonies they abhor.

As the duplicity of this shift from “live and let live” rhetoric to compulsory participation in same-sex wedding celebrations has become clear, LGBT activists and allies have responded with further misinformation and deception, this time about the nature and purpose of the anti-discrimination laws being misused to target religious dissenters like Jack and Barronelle. The general line is something like this: you can believe whatever you want, but if you go into business you have to serve everyone equally in all circumstances.

This claim is entirely false. It misrepresents the reality and purpose of anti-discrimination laws and ignores constitutional rights. Although there is significant variation between local, state, and federal anti-discrimination laws, none of these laws require, or could require, all business to serve everyone equally all the time. Here are five myths about anti-discrimination law—and the facts.

Myth 1: Anti-Discrimination Laws Apply to All Employers

Reality: While anti-discrimination laws vary, none covers every business and employer. In Phillips’ case, the relevant regulations are Colorado’s rules for public accommodations such as hotels or restaurants. But not every business, or every service offered by a business, is a public accommodation.

Additionally, it is common, although not universal, for anti-discrimination laws to exempt small businesses. Other exceptions include expressive businesses, which are necessarily exempt on free speech grounds—for example, newspapers can’t be forced to publish material they object to. Likewise, religious institutions and employers enjoy broad protections from government interference, both as a matter of the U.S. Constitution and as a matter of legislature-created statutory exemptions.

Myth 2: Anti-Discrimination Laws Protect All Customers from Discrimination

Reality: Only certain classes of people are protected from discrimination, and only then in certain circumstances. Otherwise, it’s legal to turn down business, whether for complex reasons or a simple “I don’t like you.” Some artisans even become infamous for their pickiness in clients (think of haute couturiers).

A law requiring every business to serve everyone equally in all circumstances would be a terrible idea. Businesses have all sorts of legitimate reasons to turn customers away: customers can stiff a business, make unreasonable demands, harass other customers, and so on. Or, as in Phillips’ case, customers can try to force someone to create custom artistic work against his convictions. Phillips turned down a variety of custom orders over the years, and it is only the LGBT lobby that has taken him to court.

Myth 3: Limiting Anti-Discrimination Laws Will Bring Back Jim Crow

Reality: Although supporters of expansive anti-discrimination laws regularly bring up the Jim Crow regime that federal anti-discrimination law was a response to, the comparison actually weakens their case.

First, even if every anti-discrimination law in the nation vanished overnight, we would not return to Jim Crow. Legally, Jim Crow laws didn’t just allow racial discrimination, they required it. Nothing on the scale of Jim Crow would voluntarily, let alone legislatively, arise today. Nearly everyone would reject it, and most businesses wouldn’t want to lose their customers.

Even during the Jim Crow era, many businessmen would likely have eased up on discrimination to make more money, had the law allowed it. For example, after purchasing the St. Louis Cardinals, beer magnate Gussie Busch was reportedly surprised at the team’s all-white roster; excluding black players was both morally wrong and economically stupid—as he put it, “Hell, we sell beer to everyone.”

So, in the present, where no law excludes LGBT people from ordinary commerce, why do we keep arguing about wedding vendors? It is obviously because orthodox Christians don’t want to participate in same-sex weddings and are being targeted for it. But it is also because Christians don’t object to serving LGBT patrons the rest of the time—that is, any time their work is not a creative celebration of same-sex marriage. Phillips is happy to sell LGBT patrons anything he has in his shop, including regular cakes on display, but he cannot create a custom work of culinary art to celebrate a ceremony that his religion teaches him is wrong.

A few nonconformist wedding vendors like Jack don’t inflict material harm (i.e., locking people out of essential goods and services) on anyone, which is why those who want to hijack anti-discrimination laws constantly resort to a parade of hypothetical horribles like a return to Jim Crow to justify themselves. But anti-discrimination laws should be proportionate to the real injustices they seek to remedy, not those that activists can imagine. And who makes custom wedding cakes for whom does not warrant government intervention in the way that the significant material harms Jim Crow inflicted on black citizens did.

Myth 4: Anti-Discrimination Laws Override Constitutional Rights

Reality: Although this is rarely stated so explicitly, this myth is constantly presumed by those in favor of government compulsion of speech and expression (as in Phillips’ case), or government interference in the internal affairs of religious institutions. However, anti-discrimination laws are statutory law, and therefore are subordinate to constitutional law, such as enumerated constitutional rights. Local governments can’t suspend the Constitution.

Any anti-discrimination laws that abrogate the freedoms of religion, speech, assembly, and so on should be subject to the strictest of scrutiny. Artists, for instance, have a free speech right to refuse to create works of art because compelled speech or expression is by definition unfree. The religious have a right not to be forced to participate in actions they deem sinful, but instead to live peacefully in accord with their consciences.

However, as anti-discrimination laws expand in scope, there is more potential for conflict between their demands and constitutional rights. These clashes can be minimized by focusing anti-discrimination law on its core mission: ensuring that people are not materially harmed by discrimination by being locked out of essential goods and services.

Myth 5: Anti-Discrimination Laws Have No Downside

Reality: This myth too is more often assumed than explicitly stated. However, anti-discrimination laws are not without their drawbacks. Not only are there are the costs of enforcement and compliance, but anti-discrimination laws are prime litigation bait, with plenty of frivolous claims filed and threatened.

Additionally, the sort of anti-discrimination laws that threaten artisans like Phillips reduce their freedom to live authentically. Forcing Phillips to craft a custom cake for a same-sex wedding ceremony alienates him from his business and his art. Such involuntary servitude makes people into things, cogs in a machine to serve the whims and desires of others.

Also, the owners of small businesses like Masterpiece Cakeshop have a closer relationship with their businesses than do the stockholders of a large, publicly traded corporation. Ironically, many of the same people who complain about “soulless corporations” are trying to wrench the soul out of small businesses if they cross the LGBT lobby, and in the process they are stripping away everyone’s constitutional rights.

These myths and sloppy thinking about anti-discrimination laws encourage disproportionate responses that restrict freedom and constitutional rights over trivial or even non-existent problems. We may not always agree with a business owner’s decisions, but we should respect his freedom to make them, absent a compelling government interest otherwise. When a class of people is systematically blocked from purchasing lodging, food, medical care, or other essential goods and services, there is a strong case for government intervention. Minor inconveniences or hurt feelings don’t present the same problem, however distasteful some may find the motivations of those involved.

Ironically, many of the same people who complain about ‘soulless corporations’ are trying to wrench the soul out of small businesses if they cross the LGBT lobby.

As a matter of law, people should generally be free to do businesses (or not) with others as they see fit, with the government stepping in to compel service only when absolutely necessary to prevent material harm. However, as a matter of culture, people should also be willing to do business with everyone, unless reasons of conscience (not simply spite) or prudence preclude it. This is the situation that generally prevails in America, regardless of the specifics of state and local anti-discrimination laws. Supporters of same-sex marriage should return to the live and let live promises they made, and respect the rights of dissenters to decline to participate in promoting and celebrating same-sex wedding ceremonies.

Those on the Left cheering as anti-discrimination law is hijacked and turned into a weapon against the First Amendment freedoms of religion, speech, and association should consider whether they really want to weaken these constitutional rights. Today it is conservative Christians having their rights eroded, but it will not end there. Political weapons deployed by one side will quickly be adopted by the other, and the Trump-led populist Right is vengeful and not particularly concerned with constitutional niceties or a culture of freedom.

Ultimately, violating constitutional rights to punish religious dissenters will harm everyone. In the case of Stutzman, the attorney general of Washington argued in that state’s Supreme Court filing that the government could compel a poet to write a poem expressing ideas repugnant to the poet’s conscience. This is straight-up totalitarianism, but look on the bright side. The Koch-commissioned “Rage Against the Machine” reunion album praising cops and capitalism will be great.

It Shouldn't Be Easier For HIV-Positive People Like Me To Give Blood,"California recently passed a law that reduces the criminal charges related to knowingly exposing someone to HIV without consent. It demonstrates the power of narrative over reason. Scott Weiner, a Democratic state senator of California who co-wrote the law, penned an article defending his decision. It provides us with an in-depth look at how progressives not only view the law but the morality and ethics of disclosure.

He states, “Last week, Governor Jerry Brown signed SB 239, a bill I co-authored to modernize California’s HIV criminal statutes by treating HIV *exactly* the same as other serious and deadly diseases such as Ebola, SARS, hepatitis C, and tuberculosis: as a misdemeanor. Under current California law, only HIV is treated as a felony, and you don’t have to infect anyone — or even create a risk of infection — to be guilty and go to state prison.”

By “modernize” he means the law better reflects the liberal notion of what he describes. HIV is just another disease, no worse or more destructive than any other. It also assumes the issue at hand is infection rather than disclosure or consent. He is not alone in this thinking. The LGBT advocacy group Human Rights Campaign has advocated for the removal of HIV disclosure laws for quite some time. Zack Ford of ThinkProgress has devoted many pages and even an advocacy video titled “Criminalizing HIV Doesn’t Do Anything to Help Anyone” pushing this same narrative. All parties sincerely believe they are defending innocent people from discrimination and stigma and that the issue is criminality itself.

Can Someone Consent Without Knowing the Details?

Progressives tend to understand “illegal” to be contingent on social or identity status. As Weiner argues, “Who’s being prosecuted? An awful lot of women, particularly African American women and transgender women. Women constitute about 12% of HIV-positive people in California, but they account for 43% of prosecutions under these laws.”

The majority of these women engage in sex work. As the Los Angeles Times reported on a University of California School of Law study, “The vast majority of convictions were in prostitution solicitation incidents in which it is unknown whether any contact beyond a conversation or an exchange of money was initiated, the researchers said.”

The message is that the law disproportionately affects vulnerable populations—African-American women and transwomen. This alone is reason enough to find the law unjust regardless of the relevant behavior of the individuals involved. The other side of this argument is one of outcome. If an HIV-positive man does not disclose his status to a partner, the progressive argument reasons that as long as the HIV-negative partner is not actually infected there has been no harm inflicted. This is backed up by the reasoning that HIV medications now make it extremely difficult to transmit the virus.

The problem is not one of outcome but one of motivation and responsibility. I am HIV-positive, and I have an undetectable viral load. This means it would be close to impossible for me to infect another person sexually. But do I have a moral and ethical obligation to tell a potential partner this information and allow him to determine for himself that risk? I argue that I do. The question is, should I be legally obligated as well? The answer is one of consent. Can a person consent to sex without knowing the physical risks of the activity? I assert he or she cannot.

We’re Willing to Increase HIV to Make Some Feel Better

The primary motivation is politics. Since the 1990s the LGBT Left has been fixated on the idea of a stigma against HIV and, by association, homosexuality. The outbreak’s origin in gay sex resulted in mass panic and fear, and early patients experienced isolation and irrational hostility. The LGBT Left has been obsessed with righting this social injustice ever since. It is why part of the law in question includes blood donations.

The LGBT Left believes denying gay men the ability to donate blood at all is an act of discrimination, so HIV status should not be considered here either. Again, Weiner argues, “due to modern testing technology, it’s almost impossible to get HIV from a blood transfusion. If a blood donor knows he or she is HIV-positive — in other words, if he or she gets a test that comes back positive — that means that when the blood bank tests that person’s blood, which they always do, that test will also come back positive, and the blood will be discarded and won’t infect anyone. If the blood bank tests the blood and the test comes back negative but is actually positive (that could happen if the infection occurred within a few weeks of the blood draw), then the donor’s HIV test also would have come back negative, meaning he wouldn’t be guilty of a crime since he never tested positive.”

Blood donors are asked screening questions precisely to eliminate this risk. HIV is related directly to a very limited set of behaviors that can easily be screened for. The concern is not of risk, but of feelings and outcome. If the blood will be tested anyway, why does it matter if an HIV-positive person donates it?

The only rational conclusion is the senator is more worried about the experience of rejection felt by the HIV-positive person who wants to donate blood than the risk that person poses on whoever might receive the blood. The senator accidentally advocates for tighter restrictions on blood donations by admitting a window of uncertainty could expose blood donation to HIV. Unfortunately, the emotional plea behind the argument outweighs this risk.

This Is Simply Deadly Political Correctness

Advocates hope to inspire trust and medical treatment in high-risk populations by making HIV appear far more mundane and socially acceptable. Their theory says that if HIV is “criminalized” (and it is not), exposed individuals will fear seeking testing or treatment. But testing and treatment have been widely available, often for free, for quite a while now. People are simply not arrested upon testing positive for HIV. The statistics surrounding HIV tell us the story.

From the Centers for Disease Control:

Gay and bisexual men accounted for 82% (26,376) of new HIV diagnoses among all males aged 13 and older and 67% of the total new diagnoses in the United States.

Gay and bisexual men aged 13 to 24 accounted for 92% of new HIV diagnoses among all men in their age group and 27% of new diagnoses among all gay and bisexual men.

Among all gay and bisexual men living with HIV in 2014, 83% had received a diagnosis, 61% received HIV medical care in 2014, 48% were receiving continuous HIV care, and 51% had a suppressed viral load.

Nearly half the HIV-positive gay male population refuses treatment. This undermines the fundamental argument of low infection risk. Certainly, having sex with a responsible person who takes his medications and is healthy is less risky, but if no one is required to disclose, how can you be sure he is not one of the 49 percent who isn’t taking medication at all? How can you consent to sex without this information?

The primary concern surrounding this law is of its emotional narrative. The LGBT Left celebrates this as a progressive victory and is utterly disinterested in any argument about risks, as it validates stigma or negative stereotypes they believe they are fighting. As the pattern goes, other states will take this same path and soon several more progressive states will boast of their newly “modernized” HIV laws. In the end, gay and bisexual men, especially young men, will be at a higher risk. The cultural demand for HIV privacy as an entitlement will create a scenario of predatory behaviors, recklessness, and ruined lives.

What the Right Should Do

How can the Right respond to this? So far the Right has merely reacted to the insanity of the Left on this issue but has not taken direct action. We are at a disadvantage, as the advocates of this have successfully lobbied all HIV/AIDS organizations, LGBT organizations, many women’s health organizations, and other minority advocacy groups.

Republicans should be reviewing their state laws surrounding HIV disclosure.

The medical community is eager to celebrate advances in HIV medication and invested in marketing treatment as an infection-prevention method. These advocates are correct in their assertion that many of these laws are outdated. But this should not mean they are unnecessary.

Republicans should be reviewing their state laws surrounding HIV disclosure to ensure they reflect both modern medical advances and protect individuals from reckless or malicious behavior. Consent should be the main selling point to the general population as well as moral and ethical obligation to disclose. There should be a firm legal requirement to disclose your HIV status to anyone who is at risk of exposure, but this can and must be done with rational law.

Finally, it must be absolutely imperative that blood donations be protected. Of all the concerns here, this particular issue threatens truly vulnerable people the most. Laws should evolve when necessary, but society still requires them. The Right should be on the forefront of this battle.

The Final 3 Phases In The Slide From Freedom To Communism,"As we mark the 100th anniversary of the communist takeover of Russia on November 7, 1917 (October 25, according to the old Russian calendar at the time), it’s worth pondering how the road to communism is paved. After all, its legacy is the murder of more than 100 million victims in the twentieth century alone. What mileposts or trends might we identify on the twisted road to communism?

Obviously there are different factors at play in different cultures and eras. Russia at the time was on a path to great economic and social reforms. But the instability and suffering caused especially by Russia’s involvement in World War I created a window of opportunity for violent overthrow. Vladimir Lenin seized upon this immediately when he arrived out of exile in April that year to fire up the crowds in Saint Petersburg.

Once communism gained a foothold in Russia, it doomed its citizens to lives of scarcity, misery, social distrust, terror, and mass murder. The same goes for China. Mao Zedong, Pol Pot, the Castros, Che Guevara, Joseph Stalin, the Kims of North Korea—all of them were brutal dictators enabled by a system that always places too much power into the hands of too few people. It’s a corrupt and cruel system that allows an elite oligarchy—which Lenin called a “vanguard”—to enslave the entire population.

But what about a nation like America, which was built on the idea that every human being is endowed by our Creator with the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? We have a Constitution that guarantees these rights and separates the branches of government, placing restraints on government so individuals may live freely. Furthermore, this document intentionally contained the seeds of slavery’s destruction. Americans shed a lot of blood to protect the freedoms enshrined in that document for us and for our posterity.

So is it possible that we, a free people, could ever throw it all away? Could we sell ourselves into the slavery called communism? Sadly, of course we could. Anyone who forgets his birthright is more likely to squander it. And there has been a lot of forgetting. As Ronald Reagan warned, “freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction.”

This is the third in a three-part series that attempts to parse the conditions and trends that might lead a free people to succumb to totalitarianism. In the first article, I sketched six basic phases, or processes, on the road to communism, and summarized the trends of each: 1.) Laying the groundwork through the cultivation of ignorance; 2.) Propaganda; 3.) Agitating the masses; 4.) Consolidating control over society’s institutions; 5.) Coercing conformity; and 6.) Final solutions.

In the second article, I identified in more detail the trends of the three earlier phases. In this I will try to identify trends associated with the three latter phases. Of course, there is a lot of overlap, and I’m sure readers can add many trends, including major ones, to the list. My goal is simply to build some sort of a reference list that helps identify with some specificity the conditions through which totalitarianism can root itself into an otherwise free society. My hope is that we might be better able to see—then work to remove and reverse—some of the roadblocks to freedom that lead us, unwittingly or otherwise, into communism’s path of human cruelty and evil.

Phase 4: Taking Over the Institutions of Free Society

A free society has numerous and diverse institutions. Aside from the political and the military, there are economic, social, and cultural institutions that allow for a vibrant social life and the cross-pollination of ideas. A communist society, on the other hand, cannot allow any institution to be autonomous. They all must be absorbed by the state and serve the state.

The institution of family is an especially sharp thorn in communism’s side, since it allows parents to influence future generations. Edmund Burke aptly wrote that families are the “little platoons” of society. In the eyes of totalitarians, then, autonomous families are viewed as subversive cells. Activists for big government have placed enormous focus on undermining the family, as well as other mediating institutions of society such as the church and voluntary civic associations.

Consolidating the takeover. Nearly 100 years ago, the Italian communist Antonio Gramsci declared that the key to achieving global communism was through culture, not promoting socialist economic policies that had little appeal in the West. This would require a “long march through the institutions” of society, destroying them from within so communism could fill the vacuum.

Radicals of the 1960s like Saul Alinksy picked up on this theme, noting that “the system” (i.e., American freedom) could only be destroyed once radical operatives had secured control over society’s institutions. The deep state is one example of institutional takeover that’s been building through decades of bureaucratic bloat, with operatives embedded in the military and intelligence agencies. The cultural takeover of media outlets, academia, and entertainment is both broad and deep today, after decades of creep.

But it is the mediating institutions have been most relentlessly attacked—family, church, and voluntary organizations—because they serve as buffer zones of influence that help shield individuals from abuses by the state. Today they are more vulnerable than ever to total absorption by the Mass State, a prerequisite for communism.

State takeover of family. We should now understand that agendas like “marriage equality” are not really about social inclusiveness, no matter how people feel. The main effect of the Supreme Court’s Obergefell decision is abolishing any legal recognition of marriage as an institution that unites a man and woman, with any potential offspring, into an autonomous family unit. That opens the door to a Pandora’s Box that allows more state intrusion into family life.

Most folks weren’t even aware that transgenderism was such a big part of the package until the Obergefell decision was secured. As LGBT activist and journalist Masha Gessen accurately proclaimed in 2012: The goal was not gay marriage, but marriage extinction. That naturally means state control over families, and by extension, all personal relationships.

We see this happening in large school systems that dictate what parents must allow their children to be taught about sexuality and when. It happens as judges demand small business owners disavow their faith or face financial ruin. It happens when a voluntary association like the Boy Scouts denies its very name by bowing down to gender ideology. These are not so much changes in the institutions themselves, as signs that the state is absorbing those institutions.

Destruction of childhood. Radical education reformers are pushing for a national curriculum that focuses on “social emotional learning” (SEL) as the supposed path to better academic learning. It is a monolithic curriculum in which a group called the Consortium for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) aims to dictate exactly how children should feel and relate to other people.

Data mining and universal mental health assessments are part of the program. Identity politics feeds the curriculum. CASEL’s proposed programming of children demands 100 percent compliance with its methods, content, and monopoly, so it leaves virtually no room for the healthy development of independent thinking and unique personalities.

Attacks on church doctrine from within. The Catholic Church has long been infiltrated by socialist and communist clergy, as Bella Dodd attests in her memoir as a former member of the Communist Party USA. We see it in liberation theologies that date back to the 1950s in Latin America.

The biblical doctrine that seems most under attack today is God’s creation of humanity as male and female and God’s sanctioning of their union as one flesh in the sacrament of marriage. The LGBT agenda took over in the Episcopal Church more than 20 years ago, though clergy like Bishops James Pike and John Spong pushed it along in the 1960s and 70s. We now see a proliferation of what I call the “headgear brigade” of various rainbow-clad “clergy” and their lay activist allies working hard to plant the LGBT rainbow flag onto all places of worship.

By undermining the theology and doctrines within the churches themselves—with the double whammy of undermining family at the same time—the path to totalitarianism becomes even clearer.

Phase 5: Forcing Conformity

This is the phase in which people start waking up—late—to the many deceptions on the road to totalitarianism. This would include many who actually bought into the lies. When a free person actually sees what the enforcement of conformity looks and feels like, he or she starts to reassess and perhaps switch sides. This is why the enforcement is ironclad, fast, and furious. Its trends are as follows.

Ritual defamation. Laird Wilcox, a scholar of extremist movements, wrote up an excellent explanation of “The Practice of Ritual Defamation.” Read it to gain insight into some patterns of totalitarian operation. Wilcox writes that ritual defamation is “accomplished primarily through the manipulation of words and symbols. It is not used to persuade, but to punish. Although it may have cognitive elements, its thrust is primarily emotional. Ritual Defamation is used to hurt, to intimidate, to destroy, and to persecute, and to avoid the dialogue, debate and discussion upon which a free society depends. On those grounds it must be opposed no matter who tries to justify its use.”

We can see a growing trend towards ritual defamation, from hurling the epithet “racist” against scholars like Charles Murray on college campuses to tarring mothers as “transphobics” when they object to the teaching of transgenderism to their kindergarteners and must be interviewed incognito to protect them from social assault. (Here’s looking at you, Southern Poverty Law Center.)

Psychiatry as a political weapon. There is a history behind the weaponization of the profession of psychiatry to solidify compliance in communist societies. Most notorious was the confinement of political dissenters to psychiatric wards in the Soviet Union. Many of those abuses came to light in the 1979 book, “A Question of Madness: Repression Through Psychiatry in the Soviet Union,” by Zhores and Roy Medvedev.

Although such widespread abuse is not the case in America today, we can see signs that the political weaponization of psychiatry is growing. Consider the LGBT lobby’s drive to outlaw any conversations in a therapist’s office that do not enforce the LGBT agenda, including imposing transgenderism on any child who claims to be transgender. Laws that have been enacted against reparative or “conversion therapy” aim to prevent people from changing their minds about living out a homosexual orientation or a transgender identity.

But those laws don’t seem to apply when someone wants to move in the other direction, so they do seem to allow and encourage conversion in one direction only. Meanwhile, CASEL’s agenda of Social Emotional Learning aims to conduct mental health screenings on all children without their parents’ knowledge or consent. Several legislators would like to have mental health screenings conducted on anyone who buys a firearm. And, of course, there’s a concerted effort by various politicos and psychiatrists, with petition drives, to declare President Trump mentally unfit to hold office. The list goes on.

“Struggle sessions.” Chinese communist leader Chairman Mao was a big fan of communists getting together for “sessions of criticism and self-criticism,” supposedly to keep the party pure and active. During the murderous era of the Cultural Revolution, these sessions were very common.

The struggle sessions, however, were basically data-mining operations meant to expose participants’ private thoughts that could be used as ammo against them later, and to publicly humiliate as well as incriminate others in the session. The film “Angi Vera” shows how such sessions cemented social distrust and fear when the communists took power in 1940s Hungary.

Can we hear echoes of such “sessions of criticism and self-criticism” in the so-called “white privilege” workshops proliferating on college campuses? In them, students are directed to admit guilt and spill their guts about attitudes they may or may not have held that contribute to their “privilege” in society. Basically, they’re supposed to apologize for having happy childhoods and strong relationships. What misery.

False confessions. Regarding political correctness, we’re a society of wimps. Whenever a celebrity issues an apology for saying the “wrong” thing, I can’t help but think about the communist use of recantations to enforce strict conformity. The victims tend to hold out hope for “rehabilitation” and the relief of not becoming a non-person if they recant.

As long as they issue enough mea culpas, they tend to be allowed some penance, though now owned through extortion. This is what the enforcers are really looking for to build conformity with their agendas. However, when Mozilla honchos took CEO Brendan Eich to task in 2014 upon discovering his private contribution to California’s Proposition 8 in 2008—supporting the definition of marriage as a male-female institution—I believe they were invested in Eich giving a major mea culpa. Instead, Eich simply stepped down, which is refreshing given our PC culture. (By the way, Eich has since developed a new web browser that does not track you like Google does. It’s called Brave, and I recommend it.)

Surveillance society and cultivation of social distrust. The secret police in East Germany made a point of invading the private spaces of its citizens, as superbly illustrated in the film “The Lives of Others.” Despite the Internal Revenue Service’s abuses against conservative groups or the data mining of kids in public education, we still aren’t living in 1980s East Berlin. But consider how celebrities like Lena Dunham seem intent on leading us there.

For example, in August she modelled on Twitter how to eavesdrop and snitch on private citizens having conversations about personal matters. She reported two American Airlines flight attendants she claimed were having a transphobic conversation at a terminal in JFK airport. She later made a point of telling everyone that she would continue to listen for signs of politically incorrect talk in private conversations.

The idea, of course, is to dictate what we are allowed to say even in private. There’s a lot of relational aggression and invasion of privacy here. In the meantime, human resources departments direct employees to report overheard conversations that are politically incorrect.

Phase 6: Final Solutions

Communists, like Nazis and other totalitarians, will never give up power without a fight. This is argument enough for not allowing their foot into the door in the first place. Despite all of the mockeries of anti-communism that come out of the media and pop culture, the reality is that communism’s history is bloody because it is in a constant fight against people’s right to live freely. This impulse against others’ freedom tends to be ingrained in people who have a stubbornly materialistic or atheistic outlook on life. What else is there besides power?

Dehumanization leads to flimsy pretexts for eliminating the “other.” Totalitarians use all manner of pretexts to get their way. Their calls for “equality” and “justice” tend to morph into demands for removal of their enemies “by any means necessary.” As the slogans and memes of dictators get internalized by the populace at large, groupthink solidifies. This gives power elites greater and greater latitude in eliminating perceived enemies.

Especially interesting is how murderous dictators in history tend to project their own intentions onto their perceived opponents. (That observation is brilliantly made in the Learning Company’s course “Utopia and Terror in the 20th Century.”) For example, when Stalin forced the collectivization of agriculture, he accused the farmers in Ukraine of trying to starve the nation. He then starved out and murdered some seven million of them in the winter of 1933-34.

In like manner, Adolph Hitler accused the Jews of trying to destroy the Germans, then killed more than six million Jews. In the 1990s the Hutus in Rwanda ran an intense propaganda campaign accusing the Tutsis of being devils who had it in for the Hutus. Surprise: half a million Tutsis were slaughtered, answering the Hutu propaganda campaign by chopping up their Tutsi neighbors with machetes. As the granddaughter of Armenian genocide survivors, I’ve concluded that genocide always begins with groupthink.

Officially ending even the pretense of due process or free speech. We’ve been moving in this direction for a long time. When college administrators decide to consider any allegation of rape a de facto conviction, no trial necessary or allowed, we are well on our way to dispensing of due process, the right to face one’s accuser, or such quaint ideals as innocent until proven guilty. By the same token, the First Amendment is being attacked under the guise of preventing “hate speech.”

Growing justification of violence. Once communism is established, the dam breaks on the use of violence and murder to quell dissent. But prior to the consolidation of power, we see a growing justification for using violence as a means to social justice. The use of riots and violence to effect political change has not just increased, but some mainstream commentators are getting a lot less squeamish about promoting violence as the only means to achieving justice. Consider this passage from Ezra Klein’s interview with Ta-Nehisi Coates, who cannot shake his bitterness over the existence of evil in the world:

When he tries to describe the events that would erase America’s wealth gap, that would see the end of white supremacy, his thoughts flicker to the French Revolution, to the executions and the terror. ‘It’s very easy for me to see myself being contemporary with processes that might make for an equal world, more equality, and maybe the complete abolition of race as a construct, and being horrified by the process, maybe even attacking the process. I think these things don’t tend to happen peacefully.’

For readers unfamiliar with the French Revolution (since they weren’t taught about it in school), it was basically a time of revenge killings, mob violence, and guillotine executions, all promoted through groupthink. People actually marched through the streets of Paris with the heads of their perceived enemies on pikes. Thomas Jefferson was appalled, but since he was a slave-owner who helped put together a self-correcting system that would abolish slavery in all of its forms, the French Revolution mentality would have him discredited, his memorial in Washington dismantled, and perhaps even have his grave desecrated as well.

Let’s also note how the SPLC’s “hate map” motivated a gunman to enter the Family Research Center in Washington DC, and open fire with the intent of killing as many people as he could. Another gunman inspired by the SPLC was James Hodgkinson, who on June 14 attempted to assassinate several Republican congressmen when he opened fire on a baseball field where they were practicing. Nearly fatally wounded was House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. It’s interesting how quickly the media dropped the story. Another consideration on the subject of violence is philosopher Hannah Arendt’s thesis that “the greater the bureaucratization of public life, the greater the attraction of violence.”

Hostility towards religion and prayer. It’s never enough for communists to dictate the personal relationships in society, whether between co-workers, within families, between spouses, or any other type of relationship. They inevitably make atheism a state religion, which means you aren’t even supposed to pray or have a private relationship with God.

An interesting off-shoot of this mentality is the religion of transhumanism, which is the idolization of technology (another very old story going back to the Golden Calf of the Old Testament). Transhumanism seems very modern, of course, because it’s all tied in to artificial intelligence, melding humans with machines, thereby causing immortality and becoming our own gods. Transhumanists tend to feel they’re in a race against time to achieve immortality, so they seem likely to view as a deadly threat anybody who might stand in the way of the transhumanist agenda.

But ultimately, without faith in a Creator, we can’t look beyond ourselves and see others as human because we inevitably end up succumbing to the eternal temptation to play God. And playing God is always at the root of the quest for raw power.

Communism Means Never Having to Say You’re Happy

There’s no way to underestimate the misery that totalitarian systems inflict on their victims. I think those who manage to make peace with the monolithic bureaucracies endemic to communism are in it for the numbing effect. When merit is a dirty word and mediocrity rules the day, you can coast on inertia. When we absorb the propaganda of identity politics, there is a tendency to pat ourselves on the back for being on “the right side of history.” That’s perhaps one way to cope with the scarcity and the loneliness brought about by systems that cultivate social distrust, alienation, ignorance, and mass violence.

The nucleus of human power lies within us as individuals, in our personal relationships and private conversations.

I listed six phases leading to communism (and all forms of totalitarianism) simply to try to understand how we can get from there to here. How did we go from a nation devoted to self-correction of our sins to one that seems ready to accept totalitarian thought policing and violence against people we don’t even know—because identity politics does not even allow us to look at one another as unique individuals?

Let’s remember that building freedom actually doesn’t begin in the media or Hollywood or academia. It begins in the “hidden sphere,” as explained in Soviet-era freedom fighter Vaclav Havel’s essay, “The Power of the Powerless.” This means that the nucleus of human power lies within us as individuals, in our personal relationships and private conversations. If you haven’t noticed, the hidden sphere is the clear target of totalitarian weapons like political correctness. It is designed to evoke self-censorship and destroy your ability to reach out and express yourself with others. It’s anti-friendship to its core.

So our task should always be to reach out to others—one on one and face to face—to actually get to know them and to help them get to know us. This is the best way to show our common humanity and to dispel the loneliness, misery, and lies that infect our society as a result of the many trends enumerated above. It’s those personal relationships that create a ripple effect that will return us to the freedom and goodwill breathed into America by its founding documents.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/11/08/final-3-phases-slide-freedom-communism/,2017-11-08
Virginia Suburb Elects First Openly Trans Candidate To State Office,"On Tuesday, Virginia voters elected the first trans candidate to hold state office. Danica Roem beat Republican Bob Marshall, who has held office for more than 20 years in Virginia’s House of Delegates. Roem won in House District 13, home to Prince William County, one of the most politically left counties in America. It has also been ranked one of the top ten wealthiest counties in the country.

Before running for political office, Roem, a man who began approximating a woman in 2013, worked as a local journalist for The Gainesville Times and the Prince William Times, garnering several awards. Roem’s candidacy received multiple endorsements from well-known politicians like former Vice President Joe Biden, and was the focus of many fundraising efforts, particularly outside Virginia.

When Trump announced his policies for transgenders in the military, for example, Wisconsin politician Chris Abele, a major Democratic donor, donated $50,000 to Roem’s campaign on the spot. Most of Roem’s donations came from out-of-state donors like this, and the candidate out-raised Marshall 5 to 1.

Roem: America Has ‘Millions of Transgender People’

Roem’s candidacy was controversial because of his transgenderism. Marshall refused to call Roem by the pronoun “she.” Instead of shying away from that, Roem pounced on it in a campaign video. Although Roem never mentions Marshall in the ad, the then-candidate theorizes the speaker will announce Roem as “the gentlewoman from Manassas” and posits that there are “millions of transgender people in this country and we all deserve representation in government.”

Roem’s unofficial slogan was that the candidate’s transgender identity shouldn’t be political because it’s just “Who I Am.” Despite this, of course, it was a major talking point on the campaign trail. Clearly Roem’s “gender identity” was a selling point, both to donors and to the Democrat base in Virginia, which is quite leftist.

Prince William County, which is part of the House district Roem now represents, is very encouraging to transgenderism, particularly in the school systems. This year, the Prince William County school board extended sex-contrary policy preferences for LGBTQ students and staff. Gavin Grimm, the famous transgender student who sued her school because she couldn’t use bathrooms set aside for males, hails from Gloucester, also a county in Virginia. That legal case may well reach the U.S. Supreme Court.

Winning Based on Rejecting Reality

Roem’s win is of course a victory for Democrats, who successfully parlayed their party’s anger and moderates’ disappointment in President Trump into an upset, all across the state of Virginia. Democrats gained 14 seats in the Virginia House and Senate, producing a majority by a very thin slice.

The New York Times says “The state’s 100 House of Delegate races represent the purest test of grass-roots anger at the president, according to election analysts.” Yet it’s routine for midterm elections to result in similar political upsets.

This win is a boost to transgenderism in the public square. It will be interesting to see if Roem’s win produces more LGBTQ political candidates and affects how the state of Virginia handles LGBTQ issues. The state and nearby DC metro region have been deluged with high-profile tussles between parents and school boards over transgender-approved policies demanding that boys and girls shower, compete in sports, and take overnight trips together.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/11/10/virginia-suburb-elects-first-openly-transgender-candidate-state-office/,2017-11-10
Transgenders Celebrate Election Wins. Detransitioners Tell Different Story,"Democrat Danica Roem defeated incumbent Del. Robert G. Marshall (R) on November 7 and became Virginia’s first openly transgender elected official.

Roem’s fundraising numbers more than doubled Marshall’s, in part due to nationwide support from pro-LGBT groups, including the Human Rights Campaign (HRC). Roem’s top donor, who individually contributed $180,000 (almost a quarter of the total raised), was Chris Abele, a major contributor to liberal causes and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) advocacy groups.

The political power of the LGBTQ rainbow carried the day in electing Roem. If the candidate had been Dan Roem, few across the nation would have noticed his candidacy. This election result shows that the LGBTQ rainbow and the HRC are strong forces in the Democratic Party today. Roem was not the only trans person ushered into office on Tuesday. Minneapolis elected two openly transgender people to city council, Andrea Jenkins and Phillipe Cunningham.

Trans candidates can take advantage of the identity politics in play today. Social justice warrior appeal and the ability to gather national financial support makes it challenging for contenders in local races to compete. Candidates who don’t embody some “special identity” appear unappealingly old-fashioned and socially out of touch.

What Makes a Transgender Person?

The LGBTQ lobby is waving the rainbow victory flag and the U.S. media celebrates. But no one celebrates when a transgender person realizes that the trans life is not for him. No courage awards are given to regretters who want to leave their medically induced gender and live again as their genetically coded birth sex, a process called detransitioning or retransitioning. It typically is arduous, both emotionally and physically. Surgeries and years of taking cross-gender hormones have physical consequences that can’t be reversed.

In the ten years I have been interviewing and working with transgender people who regret their transitions, I have found, to my amazement, one common thread in the stories of all. Each has some form of unresolved childhood pain that contributed to the onset of gender dysphoria. Most are deeply depressed.

It was not some pre-natal hormone wash in the womb that affected their gender identity. It was deep emotional pain. One hundred percent of the time, people who write to me wanting to undo the gender change can identify the unresolved life-changing trauma that triggered the desire to change genders.

Roem also faced a traumatic childhood event that could result in deep pain and a sense of loss for anyone. Dan Roem was born September 30, 1984. When little Dan was only three years old, his father, John Paul Roem, took his own life. The loss of one’s father to suicide is deeply painful and could contribute to a fragile sense of gender identity.

The boy’s maternal grandfather, Anthony Oliveto, acted as a father figure and introduced the child to his favorite sport, baseball. But a grandfather, no matter how great, cannot be expected to make up for losing one’s father.

Young Roem played on Little League baseball teams, but the other boys teased him for being awkward and effeminate. He began privately identifying as female and trying on female hair accessories in secret. In his teens, Roem escaped to the basement and practiced guitar during stormy conflicts between his mother and her boyfriend. Rohm began his physical transition in 2012, then three years later legally changed his name to Danica.

Identifying as a trans woman can serve as an escape or reprieve for unresolved childhood pain. Whether this is the case for Roem, only he can know. But as people wishing to undo gender change report to me, and as evidenced in my own life as a trans woman, the gender change doesn’t always fix what’s broken and the desire to be the opposite gender doesn’t always last. I’ve heard from people who question their gender change as soon as three weeks after surgery up to 30 years later.

Detransitioners Tell Their Stories

Those who detransition generally don’t inform their doctors, so they aren’t counted in any reversal statistics. As I know personally from living as a trans woman for eight years and from interacting with detransitioners who contact me for advice, people who decide to undo a gender change are reluctant to share their stories privately or publicly. They don’t want people to find out. The emotional risk is too high.

I understand and respect their need for privacy and the freedom to navigate the detransition process in their own way and in their own time. But I also know that people who are considering detransition feel isolated. For someone questioning, reading stories of those who have traveled this path can be life-changing.

Over the years, a few courageous souls have overcome their fears and shared their experiences publicly out of a desire to help others who are amid the struggle. The reasons for retransitioning are complex and varied. Each person’s story deserves to be heard with compassion and given respect. Here are four people who have bravely offered their experience for others to consider.

Rene Jax had gender-change surgery from male-to-female (MTF) in 1980. He broke barriers when he became the first openly trans police officer in San Francisco. Now this history-maker has written a book, “Don’t Get On the Plane: Why a Sex Change Will Ruin Your Life,” in which he uses his experience to show the dangerous outcomes that result when government and medicine use political correctness instead of science as a guide.

He writes on the book jacket: “By embracing and supporting cross sex living and all the medications and surgeries that doctors are offering us, transsexuals are condemning themselves to a life of being a social pariah.”

Joel Nowak’s story was featured in The Sydney Morning Herald. Nowak went to Mexico to buy female hormones to start MTF transition when he was 32, and had the surgery three years later, becoming “Jennifer.” At first, life as a woman was exhilarating, but by the age of 40, Jennifer was having long bouts of depression and feeling isolated.

Step by little step, Nowak says he left Jennifer behind and returned to life as Joel. He was astonished at the lack of resources for retransitioning. Through his website at retransition.org, he shares his experience and lessons to help other post-operative transgender people who are, as he says, “desperate for an exit strategy.”

Elan Anthony, now age 42, told his story of transition and detransition for The Guardian this September. He transitioned to female at age 19 and detransitioned 20 years later. His story is like many others who swallow the idea “hook, line and sinker” that one can change genders. He now thinks he was rushed into transitioning by well-intentioned but ultimately misguided people. It took a long time and a lot of therapy to conclude that transitioning from male to female was, for him, a mistake.

This past September, The Economist 1843 Magazine told the story of Max Robinson’s detransition in a well-nuanced article about treating transgender children. Max was born female, but after years of feeling like a misfit in his sex, she came out as transgender to her parents around age 15.

Max saw a therapist, and against the therapist’s advice insisted that she had to have hormones and surgery. She started testosterone shortly before she turned 17, and had a mastectomy the following year. It was a happy time for Max. But six months after she began successfully passing as a male, she realized, deep down, that she wasn’t sure any more. When Max was 19, just more than three years after she came out as transgender, she realized she’d made a mistake and began detransitioning.

We Need More Public and Professional Discourse

With the topic of detransition off-limits for so long, it’s encouraging to see people speaking up because that helps others in similar circumstances. It’s also encouraging to see websites offering detransition information and safe forums, such as sexchangeregret.com (my website), thirdwaytrans.com, and retransition.org.

What is lacking, however, is professional help with medical, psychological, and legal questions. The medical profession needs to develop protocols to educate doctors and other health professionals in best practices of care for this neglected group.

The newly elected trans people can bask in celebrating their historic election victories, but my hope is, as they advocate for trans rights in their respective districts, that they will not forget the ones who aren’t happy with gender change and who also need an advocate.

Why I Don’t Want To Force Anyone To Bake A Cake For My Gay Wedding,"The Masterpiece Cakeshop Supreme Court case will be far more influential than it should be. The key question is fairly easily answered and agreed upon by all sides on most other issues concerning freedom of association.

We seem to agree that Twitter should be allowed to limit racists’ expression, as it does not wish to be associated with that message. We understand why they choose not to verify white supremacist leaders, as that may provide the appearance of endorsement. We do not blame any business choosing not to host or participate in hateful activities.

Without comparing the two, it should be simple to appreciate why religious people who deeply oppose socially changing marriage to include same-sex couples would not wish to endorse or participate in a same-sex wedding.

No gay person has been discriminated against or denied a service offered by any business in question within the last several years of cases. Twitter more directly denies its public services to individuals based on being identified as associating with hateful groups than cake shops have denied gay couples access to their services. Masterpiece Cakeshop, as with many caterers, florists, and photographers, has merely declined to participate in an event or associate their brand with that event.

Why do LGBT activists perceive this as a direct attack on the validation of their relationships? It seems logical that a person would not wish to give money to another person who morally disapproves of their behavior. I would not seek employment or request a table at a Planned Parenthood event and expect them to accommodate me. Why would I help them raise money or support their business model? If I encountered an individual morally uncomfortable with participating in an activity with me and my boyfriend, such as couple photos or planning a party, it would be uncomfortable for me to force her.

It’s Not About Logic, It’s About Validation

The issue at hand is not one of reason, but one of validation. The LGBT Left has become obsessed with complete acceptance from the public in all areas. It isn’t enough that same-sex marriage is legal, despite the wishes of many people in many states. Those people must celebrate same-sex marriages or be shamed in public. Many gay people genuinely feel personally attacked when faced with an individual who does not approve of their sexual behavior.

Let’s take a moment to look at the issue from the gay couple’s side. If I were to go into a photography shop and request a booking to capture a special event with my boyfriend, for example, and the cashier said “Oh, I’m sorry, but we do not photograph same-sex couples,” I would admittedly be taken aback.

For one, I would be completely shocked by the abnormality of the reaction. I traveled recently, and at many security points along the way authorities inquired about my relationship status. I used the word “boyfriend” without hesitation and absolutely no one blinked twice. I have come to assume normalcy in my day to day life.

It is this very emotion the Left is mostly concerned about. The moment of rejection and the realization one has been rejected solely on his sexuality is the most troubling aspect. The LGBT world has built itself on a foundation of overcoming rejection of its legitimacy, so is hyper-sensitive towards even the hint of it. Much of the LGBT Left’s inner-circle dialogue focuses on hypothetical situations in which rejection happens and the individual or group triumphs over it. When it happens in real life, it is a sudden and powerful validation of who they are, and winning in spite of bigotry is a valuable prize.

Yet this is such a rare event that when it does happen the LGBT world unites in outrage, each reliving what they imagine the rejection would feel like and contributing to the emotional outpouring of anger and support. It is why something as simple as “You could always go to another shop” enrages them so intensely. The very notion they should have to at all validates the hate they believe surrounds them daily.

Refusing Service to Gays Is Not Like Refusing It to Blacks

It is also fairly reasonable to assume that if an interracial couple reported similar treatment, the vast majority of the population would be outraged in exactly the same way. We have all grown up with imagery of black people being discriminated against by cruel shop owners, and if we were to hear of this happening would quickly relive the strong emotions we felt when first witnessing it in fiction. I can certainly recall the anger, sadness, and desire to protect I experienced watching civil rights movies as a child.

A fundamental goal of the Left is to associate rejection of LGBT with the rejection of black Americans and shame accordingly. The only problem is the rejection is in no way similar or rooted in the same source. The objection to homosexuality is profoundly different than racism and we cannot lump the two together due to our cultural evolution on both subjects.

We oppose both anti-LGBT bigotry and racism, but anti-LGBT bigotry and racism are not the same things. A person who religiously opposes same-sex marriage is not acting out of malice or bigotry. They are honoring their deeply held religious beliefs. Their personal feelings in no way obstruct the same-sex couple from pursuing their relationship or marriage.

Let’s look at the Christian cake maker. Why would baking a cake be such a profoundly significant act? The issue is, of course, not the act of making the cake but of associating with the activity the cake will be used for.

Orthodox Jews are careful not to drink wine from bottles held or sold by non-Jews. Why? Is it an act of prejudice or hatred? No. They believe the non-Jew is just as religious and faithful to their gods as the Orthodox Jew is to his, and they assume the non-Jew was thinking about enjoying his wine in honor of said gods. The Orthodox Jew does not want to drink that same wine and accidentally honor other gods in turn.

The Christian baker is not rejecting the gay couple, but politely declining to participate in a celebration he feels violates his promises to honor his god. The cake will be used to celebrate the event. Its only purpose is to honor and consecrate the union. Our culture views eating the wedding cake as public confirmation of the joy of marriage. It is why we share the cake with all of our friends and family who attend to celebrate with us. It is a meaningful cultural act. If it were not so, the same-sex couple would not be so offended.

These Rules Also Force Religious Folks Into Hypocrisy

Beyond that, if a Christian professes to support biblical ideals of marriage but is seen as associating his brand with same-sex marriages, it could be perceived as an act of hypocrisy. There is a Jewish prohibition against even appearing to break a commandment and possibly lead other Jews to sin.

A Jew is prohibited from eating shrimp, for example. Imitation shrimp is available, and is perfectly kosher. However, if other people were to see a good Jew eating what they believe is shrimp, it may undermine their opinion of the Jew’s dedication and faith. They may look poorly on all Jews and question Jewish religious tradition. Other Jews may choose to eat real shrimp believing it to now be permissible because they watched the good Jew eat the fake shrimp.

A Christian cannot allow the current culture to erode away her faith over time, little by little. She must stand strong for herself, for her god and for other Christians. Just because society wants her to celebrate same-sex weddings does not mean she should abandon her principles to do so. The baker would not be able to disassociate his business from the same-sex wedding and thus involuntarily be participating in it and associating his reputation and name with the celebration.

The Battle Between Faith and Feelings

This issue is a battle between the emotional reaction to being rejected and the personal desire to honor faith and religious obligation. In my example, although I would be taken aback by a rejection, I would feel it is my responsibility to choose another photographer rather than force another person to violate her faith for my satisfaction.

What if a security officer refused to allow me on a plane because he disapproved of my relationship? Wouldn’t allowing discrimination lead to this consequence? I do not believe we can restrict the rights of some to prevent an unlikely occurrence based on a hypothetical scenario. It is simply ridiculous for me to fear that reaction, and if it happened that person’s supervisor would quickly intervene.

The outcome of this case matters because it will determine how everyone is required to associate themselves regardless of how they feel in the future. As is usually the case, the Left cannot conceive of the cage they are locking themselves in to trap their enemies. This is not a civil rights issue, but one of freedom for all.

I do not want Twitter to be forced to endorse racists, and I do not want the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop to be forced to violate his faith for another person’s celebration. It really should be that simple.

"No, Lifting ‘Net Neutrality’ Doesn’t Hurt Gay People","Among the remarkable overreactions to the repeal of net neutrality rules, one of the most bizarre claims asserted that the decision placed LGBT people in harm’s way. I do not pretend to fully understand all the aspects of this topic, but I am certain that how an Internet service provider (ISP) coordinates traffic online is not a threat to me as a gay man. The loudest voice on the LGBT Left came from GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation), the largest LGBTQ media advocacy organization in the world.

Back in July of this year, they released a call to action titled “Join the Internet-Wide Day of Action to save Net Neutrality,” with this premise: “Without net neutrality, internet censorship that harms the LGBTQ community is not only possible, but inevitable.”

The article quoted, Lucas Grindley, editor in chief of The Advocate, a gay publication: “The Advocate has long benefited from absolutely ‘free’ speech that doesn’t come with a bill owed to the very people we’re protesting. The forces of intolerance are scared by a loud and organized resistance, and now they’re proposing weakening one of the tools it fears most — the internet. Creating an internet for the privileged and another for the rest of us is worse than losing neutrality, it’s about losing equality.”

The article asserted, “ISPs could make it more difficult for users to access political coverage they don’t like, or resources for marginalized groups, like the LGBTQ community” and “we could see network owners charge a premium for community spaces, like chatrooms, message boards, and social networks. This means that LGBTQ teens, or people in isolated areas, who depend on the internet as their primary source of information and community will suffer.” GLAAD listed a series of concerns, including claims larger corporations threaten LGBT organizations for media attention, marketing, Google placement, and other forms of visibility.

On the day of the decision, GLAAD President Sarah Kate Ellis tweeted out: “Stripping away net neutrality is the latest attempt by the Trump Administration to silence voices of already marginalized communities and render us invisible.” There are many layers of profoundly ludicrous assumptions made by all parties involved here.

Guys, It’s Not the 1890s Anymore

To begin with, the underlying assertion is that somehow LGBT media is the target of censoring efforts from major online sources only held back by the federal government. It goes without saying that this is manifestly absurd. Hundreds of major, worldwide companies, including nearly every recognizable brand in America, promoted gay pride month this year, as they have for more than a decade.

They created rainbow-themed versions of their products for this event and each released gushing praise for LGBT equality and acceptance on social media and in advertising. Ellen DeGeneres has the second-highest rated daytime TV show, featuring every celebrity guest imaginable including President Obama and Michelle Obama. President Obama awarded Ellen the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor.

LGBT issues dominate the news cycle and political discourse, and touch every corner of media from sports to movies to award shows. It is simply impossible to view the current media attention given to LGBT people and walk away believing we are at risk for being censored online by major ISPs.

It is equally disingenuous to argue LGBT people experience anything close to “invisibility” or are at risk of being pushed into the background. LGBT people cannot objectively be considered a “marginalized” community at all. We are not only mainstream, we are heavily promoted and given preferences.

The Media Will Never Say Anything About Throttling?

Asserting that “ISPs could make it more difficult for users to access political coverage they don’t like” is a willful ignoring of current events. It is maddening to witness the Left continue to pretend that their political side is the one fighting for freedom of expression and battling censorship. Again, this notion would require one to accept the idea that left-wing political views, which dominate the mainstream media, are at risk of being censored by ISPs.

Arguing for the safety of teenagers is a common tactic of the LGBT Left, but in this case, they seem to be imagining teenagers from 20 years ago. LGBT teens are not seeking out “chat rooms” in darkened corners of their house hiding from their parents. An ongoing narrative is that LGBT teens, widely celebrated in media and openly expressing themselves in school and online currently, are somehow still hiding in the closet in fear.

This is false, and obviously so. All social media is openly left-wing. All social media companies cater to diversity and social justice and provide special protections for LGBT youth.

The Advocate article assumes the enemies they are protesting are Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T. Yet if any consumer will pay more for anything, it will be to the ISPs themselves. Plus, these companies are out and proud. For gay pride month, Comcast provided a week-long freeview of award-winning LGBT programming. Verizon has a page on their official site dedicated to their pro-LGBT advocacy titled, “Verizon: A Champion for LGBT Rights Every Day.” AT&T partnered with GLAAD for their fifth annual Live Proud Campaign designed to “encourage[] the LGBT community and its allies to declare ‘We Are Bold’ in various ways.”

Let’s Be Real: Media Companies Are Pro-Gay

The final layer of argument relies on the idea that those who pay more will get a faster lane than those who pay less. Alvin McEwen of the anti-Christian LGBT blog titled “Holy Bullies and Headless Monsters” described this as an intentional way to keep LGBT people ignorant and afraid. Again, given the current social climate, this is preposterous.

If anybody will be getting a faster lane, it’s most likely to be media and major corporation-approved diversity websites that will, of course, include LGBT organizations and media. Conservative websites or anything labeled a “hate site” will find themselves in the slow lane with far more difficulty gaining attention from average Internet users, regardless of how much they pay.

It is unnerving to realize that the leaders of the LGBT movement seem to believe average gay people are utterly dependent on them for seemingly everything. Yet the information they provide is typically widely available on most other websites. All media reports on major LGBT policy agenda goals, HIV/AIDS, and anti-LGBT threats or hate crimes. Media is no longer carefully segregated by theme or topic. Everyone reports on absolutely everything in this domain that appears newsworthy. No LGBT issue or advocacy will be ignored or missed.

The LGBT Left Feeds on Making Gay People Afraid

Yet since fear generates more political action, we will likely see more of this kind of mentality. But all LGBT media is telling us here is they require a government body to manage their content and audiences and provide them with special priority statuses. They require major corporations to promote their otherwise small and highly niche media. Their influence directly depends on artificial boosting by politically driven ideologues in mainstream media. Why would they otherwise be concerned that removing this prioritization would result in their near obliteration from the mainstream media and news cycle?

LGBT media is saying they require a government body to manage their content and audiences and provide them special priority statuses.

Identity politics thrive on this kind of tribal fear and belief in an all-powerful demonic force just on the horizon from which they must protect you. They have held privilege and position unearned and out of proportion to their societal presence for so long that they cannot function without it. They cannot blend into society as normal and equal citizens interested in the same things most average people care about. They frantically hold onto extremely niche corners of the information marketplace and fear they will go out of business without help from the government.

Net neutrality may result in no recognizable change to our daily experience online. We certainly enjoyed the Internet before 2015, when it was established, and it is difficult to imagine comfortable ISPs having an interest in dramatically changing how people use and pay for Internet services. But if any censorship or deprioritization will affect any ideological group, it will not be LGBT folks by any stretch of the imagination. The conservative movement, the enemy these groups cite, is far more likely to face that uphill battle.

Fortunately, we are used to it, and rely on more than identity-affirming websites to find purpose and validation online. Sadly, even with an overwhelming majority share of media coverage and social celebration, the LGBT world will never accept that reality. They will continue believing they are victimized by the only group in America actively censored online.

The Top 4 Anti-LGBT Myths Of 2017,"In a year of nonstop crisis, scandal, violence, and political unrest, it is easy to understand how many people across the country feel on edge. As we well know, fear is often an effective tool to motivate the masses in a desired direction.

LGBT media would have us all believe that LGBT people are in a near-constant state of danger in the United States and under assault from the police, Republicans, and the president himself. But a closer inspection tells us this simply isn’t true. Let’s take a look at the top anti-LGBT myths of 2017.

1. 2017 Was the Deadliest Year for Transgender People

If you have been paying attention to the media, you will have noticed a series of headlines stating, “Transwoman is the 17th…19th…22nd…murdered so far this year!” The dramatic statement with an escalating victim count gives the impression that transgender people, specifically transwomen of color, are being intentionally targeted for hate crimes across the country. The panic of each news story validates feelings of victimhood and fear and causes those scrolling by to believe in an epidemic of violence.

This narrative inspires government policy and initiative to curb the violence and demands to demonstrate intolerance for hate crimes. In September, Rep. Keith Ellison introduced a congressional resolution titled “Recognizing the violence and other challenges faced by transgender women of color in America.”

Ellison and several other congressional leaders signed a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions in March pleading for him to do something about transgender murders. The letter stated, “We write to urge you to investigate the recent murders of multiple African-American transgender women around the United States. Transgender women are over four times more likely to be murdered than the general population of all women, and 2017 is on track to be the most deadly year for transgender women, particularly those who are African-American.”

In “2017 has been the best year for trans people; it’s also been the worst,” Salon wrote, “According to sociologist Nielan Barnes, a professor at California State University, Long Beach, the very visibility and increasing acceptance that helped lift Roem [the first openly transgender to win state office in America] and others into office may lie at that heart of what can feel like a deadly backlash. ‘More attention is directed to the LGBT population, and transgender individuals, because they’re non-gender-conforming, and they’re far more visible, tend to be a target.’”

It is important to recognize the value of each life and empathize with the tragedy the families of these victims face. However, it is equally important to recognize that there is not a single thing law enforcement, or certainly the federal government, could do to prevent them. Why? Because the murders have absolutely no pattern or consistent motivation. Despite the headlines and the rhetoric, there is no indication any specific threat towards transgender individuals, of any gender identity or race, exists.

A close examination of each case provides insight into the real causes of these tragedies. Human Rights Campaign compiled a list of the known transgender murders in 2017 with details about each individual. Each can be linked back to local reporting and police statements. While major LGBT news sites reporting on the murders tend to fixate on the police “misgendering” the victim and devote most of their articles to quoting positive things said by the people who loved them while lamenting the rise in violence, these articles contain clues to the origins of each case.

After researching the known 28 cases, it becomes clear that these individuals are the victims of robberies, domestic violence, police use of lethal force, sex work, and drugs or random acts of violence rather than targeted anti-LGBT motivation. In fact, not a single case listed in 2017 can be directly linked to the victim’s gender identity. The most brutal murders were committed by partners or other people the victim knew personally. Others remain unsolved with no indication of a motive. Three involved the victim physically attacking or threatening the police before being killed.

LGBT media chooses to attribute anti-LGBT bias as a motivation for a political purpose. These are simply transgender people who were murdered, not people murdered for being transgender. The HRC admits this as much in their report: “While the details of these cases differ, it is clear that fatal violence disproportionately affects transgender women of color, and that the intersections of racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia conspire to deprive them of employment, housing, healthcare and other necessities, barriers that make them vulnerable.”

The goal appears to be to fabricate a narrative to encourage fear without recognizing the true threats are more mundane and common-sense. We all know that sex work is dangerous, as is drug use. We know the threats of domestic violence and why reporting and escaping are vital for survival. We also know that if you walk down a darkened street at night in Chicago, bad things can happen. This affects us all equally, and depends entirely on the situation at hand, not one’s sexual status.

2. LGBT Hate Crimes on The Rise

Throughout 2017 we saw increasingly dramatic headlines warning of the rise in anti-LGBT hate crimes. BuzzFeed, for example, used the headline “This Report Says More LGBT People Were Killed So Far In 2017 Than In All Of 2016” to denote an increase of LGBT murders from 28 to 33 from 2016 to 2017. This trend continued from the previous year, when The New York Times declared: “L.G.B.T. People Are More Likely to Be Targets of Hate Crimes Than Any Other Minority Group.”

This article cited the most recent FBI hate crimes statistics from 2014 and a poll that asked Republicans and Democrats what they thought was most likely the motive of the Pulse night club shooting in 2016. The choices were “Mostly Terrorism, Mostly Hate Crime, or Both.” Thirty-seven percent of Democrats described it as a hate crime, and only 8 percent as a terrorist attack. The majority of all respondents said “both.”

The article quoting the statistics stated that one-fifth of all hate crimes were anti-LGBT-motivated. The 2016 FBI hate crimes report, the most recent available, said 17.7 percent of all hate crimes were anti-LGBT-motivated. This, as the “epidemic of transgender murders” narrative, implies a high risk to LGBT Americans.

But a closer look at the data provides proportion and perspective. According to the Pew Research Center in 2017, LGBT people make up roughly 4 percent of the American population, about 10 million people. There were 1,255 reported anti-LGBT hate crimes in 2016. This means that in 2016, 0.001 percent of the American LGBT population experienced hate crimes.

Even with claims of “underreporting” and accusations of police not correctly labeling hate crimes, multiplying the number by 100 (125,000 anti-LGBT hate crimes) would represent a risk to 0.1 percent of LGBT people. The numbers simply do not reflect the narrative. In truth, hate crimes overall are remarkably low for a country and population of the United States’ size and diversity.

3. Religious Liberty as a License to Discriminate

A popular rallying cry this year was against the “license to discriminate,” the way the Left describes religious freedom legal standards. As the Los Angeles Times puts it: “If you thought 2016 was a nasty, brutish year for LGBT rights across the country, 2017 is already shaping up to be much, much worse. Over the holidays, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) announced that he would be reintroducing the First Amendment Defense Act, a bill first put forward in 2015. It would prevent the government from taking action against businesses that discriminate against LGBT people based on their ‘religious belief or moral conviction…’”

Masterpiece Cakeshop did not discriminate at all or deny service to anyone based on his or her sexuality.

This year the Supreme Court heard the Masterpiece Cakeshop case, about a Christian baker who refused to create an artistic wedding cake for a same-sex wedding. The case inspired many frantic headlines warning of an impending wave of anti-LGBT discrimination should the court rule in favor of the baker. The LGBT world was aflame with hypothetical concerns of where, when, and how they may find themselves shunned from public life.

The truth, of course, is that Masterpiece Cakeshop did not discriminate at all or deny service to anyone based on his or her sexuality. In the last few years, we have seen many small business owners accused of this based solely on their opposition to participating in a same-sex wedding. At no time did we witness any owner or advocate declare a desire to not serve gay people. As is true with most of the cases, the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop offered to make the gay couple a different cake for any other occasion. His only objection was designing an artistic expression for the purpose of celebrating an event he religiously opposes.

The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, signed by President Bill Clinton, demonstrates the absurdity of the overall claim. Businesses all across America were not actively limiting or removing gay customers or denying them service during that time or since. American business owners have always had the freedom to discriminate against gay customers, and they simply have never chosen, as a general rule, to do so. There is no reason to believe they will start now.

4. The Anti-LGBT President

Of course, no discussion of liberal mythology would be complete without looking at how they represent President Donald Trump. Trump is a unique figure because he has been a well-known media icon for decades and has long publicly supported LGBT rights. He is arguably the most pro-LGBT president ever to be elected and the first to openly support same-sex marriage upon election. Yet, as this Newsweek headline proclaims: “TRUMP IS WAGING OUTRIGHT WAR AGAINST LGBTQ AMERICANS,” the media narrative would have you believe otherwise.

Trump is arguably the most pro-LGBT president ever to be elected and the first to openly support same-sex marriage upon election.

Besides openly embracing his LGBT supporters during his campaign, President Trump demonstrated his preference for equality when he appointed Richard Grenell, an openly gay man, as ambassador to Germany. His general disinterest in identity politics as a whole represents his inclination towards natural diversity and actual equal treatment. He appears to treat LGBT individuals exactly as he treats everyone else.

A close examination of the accusations against Trump reveals a political agenda to label any opposition to currently popular left-wing initiatives as “anti-LGBT.” This is evidenced by claiming everything from the newest tax bill to the Obamacare renovations to net neutrality are designed to intentionally harm gay people.

It can be argued that President Trump has opposed the current transgender social agenda to push gender identity politics onto the nation’s schools. He rescinded President Obama’s pro-transgender memo sent to all U.S. public schools. Trump also famously sparked outrage by announcing a ban on transgender service members.

Yet the military ban appears to be more practical than malicious. Transgender individuals have an extremely high suicide rate, with 40 percent reporting attempting suicide during their lifetimes. Transgender women (biological males) are up to 3.6 percent more likely to face crippling depression or anxiety than the general population is.

While it can be argued transgender service members are qualified and it is wrong to discriminate against them, it is tough to argue the motivation is pure bias.

NPR reports: “Four in 10 of the women had a mental health or substance dependence disorder, and 1 in 5 women had at least two diagnosed psychiatric conditions. More than a third of them had experienced depression, and 1 in 5 women had contemplated suicide in the past month. Rates of anxiety, post-traumatic stress, alcohol dependence and other substance dependence also was higher than average.”

There is also a high cost associated with this population. Military estimates put sex-change costs upwards of $8.4 million dollars annually. The military has a long list of medical conditions that bar entry into service. This includes drug or alcohol abuse, a history of psychiatric disorders, anemia, asthma, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and many more conditions. While it can be argued transgender service members are qualified and it is wrong to discriminate against them, it is tough to argue the motivation is pure bias. There is a legitimate medical concern.

Mythology is difficult to counter, as belief intertwines with emotion and identity. But the truth matters, and it should always be stated without hesitation. A comforting lie helps no one. Sadly, much of the current LGBT media appears to be more dedicated to constructing a useful narrative than simply celebrating everyday equality and natural diversity.

The truth is, America is an amazing place to live if you are a gay or trans person. We enjoy abundant freedom and true personal choice and expression. The victimhood narrative simply cannot survive examination, and we must continue to expose it.

Georgetown University To Offer ‘Jesuit-Approved’ LGBTQ-Only Housing,"From down the ages comes a common children’s game called “You-show-me-yours-I’ll-show-you-mine.” Surely, sweet reader, you never played it. But just as surely you have heard of it. After all, it does still exist. It comes now with upgrades.

What was once a forbidden pastime among prepubescent kids has been reimagined for young adults by cultivated minds at Georgetown University. Persons old enough to marry, vote, and go to war can amuse themselves with the old game, this time with grown-up approval. The revamped version includes one highly significant improvement: If I like yours better, I can have it. Or, at least, pretend to while I get used to the idea.

It is a timely, empirical diversion designed to keep customers coming. Georgetown already earns four out of five stars on the Campus Pride Index. Here is a chance for the full monty.

Campus Reform informs us that the once-eminent Jesuit university has approved a residential housing option reserved exclusively for students interested in exploring gender-and-sexuality conundrums beyond the confines of a seminar room. “Associate Director of Residential Education Katie Heather informs student Grace Smith, leader of the LLC [Living Learning Community] effort, that her proposal [for a queer-only campus residence’ has ‘been approved and accepted for the 2018-2019 academic year. Congratulations!'”

Heather’s email to Smith, who heads the student government’s LGBTQ+ Inclusivity Policy Team, adds that logistics are being finalized: “This includes the location of the community, marketing, and the application process.”

Note the emphasis on marketing. Georgetown will promote the LLC dorm as a selling point. With an annual price tag of about $72, 214 (base tuition of $52,300 plus room, board, and standard add-ons), the university’s expanded excursion into non-judgmental, fictive experience will—it is hoped—broaden consumer appeal and be good for box office.

Dude, I Think You Need to Read a Catholic Catechism

Vice President of Student Affairs Todd Olson croons that this new residence—a leading-edge safe space—upholds “Jesuit values of community in diversity and educating the whole person.” He continues: “It is in keeping with our Catholic and Jesuit values to provide a language, perspective, and sense of inclusion for deepening our sense of cura personalis.”

Georgetown already permits students to live—and shower and pee—with those who identify themselves however they choose, regardless of their biological sex. Which Catholic and Jesuit values accord with facilitating student petitions to inhabit in real-time the dystopian eroticism encouraged in “Brave New World”? And what, precisely, are the duties of a director of residential education?

The office suggests that education as a function of the classroom is an idea that no longer holds. Cocooned behind her title, Georgetown’s Heather sounds as cheerfully forward-thinking as Aldous Huxley’s director of Hatcheries and Conditioning. The DHC, on a tour of the garden, observes a small group of kidlets at play:

‘That’s a charming little group,’ he said pointing. . . . two children, a little boy of about seven and a little girl who might have been a year older, were playing very gravely and with all the focused attention of scientists intent on a labour of discovery, a rudimentary sexual game. ‘Charming, charming,’ the DHC repeated sentimentally.

The director is interrupted by the sound of crying:

From a neighboring shrubbery emerged a nurse, leading by the hand a small boy who howled as he went. An anxious-looking little girl trotted at her heels. ‘What’s the matter?’ asked the Director. The nurse shrugged her shoulders. ‘Nothing much,’ she answered. ‘It’s just that this little boy seems rather reluctant to join in the ordinary erotic play. I’d noticed it once or twice before. And now again today. He started yelling just now . . .’

We’re Happy to Have You in Lifelong Therapy

In a sane culture, any applicant for Georgetown’s pandering experiment in educational living would be directed to therapy for counseling. But that is all past us now. Therapists are in on the scheme.

Mystification of sexuality, with its kaleidoscope of fanciful genders, opens a valuable new stream of lifelong clients seeking affirmation. Pathology attaches now only to those who cling to an outmoded understanding of normalcy and, like Huxley’s tyke, resist the game: “[Nurse says], ‘I’m taking him in to see the Assistant Superintendent of Psychology. Just to see if anything’s at all abnormal.’”

You might think that care for the entire person—cura personalis—would demand countering the long, institutional march against established norms, particularly sexual ones. That charity in its fullness would deny efforts to override the concept of normalcy and of nature itself. Instead, a Jesuit institution has permitted LBGTQ militants to turn a gracious phrase into a slogan of infiltration with a religious gloss.

Note the hashtag Smith appends to her exultant email crowing about the group’s ideological inversion of the Latin phrase: #queerpersonalis. It is almost tempting to view Georgetown’s docility from the perspective of George Orwell’s remark: “There’s always room for one more custard pie.” Only this pie is toxic.

Their Refusal To Tolerate Is Creating Global Backlash On LGBT People,"Last December, Politico published a leaked memo by State Department senior aide Brian Hook, on the importance of realism in U.S. foreign policy. Extensively citing speeches of President Ronald Reagan, Hook argues that instead of seeking to impose human rights, democracy, and liberal values, the United States should lead by example and incentivize good behavior.

This return to pragmatism breaks with the Obama years’ rigid ideological dogmatism about human rights and clearly rattled the bureaucrats who leaked the memo. But his arguments cannot be easily shoved aside. Promoting a rigid leftist agenda internationally is a form of social engineering.

It is not only politically fraught, it is an ethereal goal that cannot be quantified. And it demands untold expenditures for unforeseeable amounts of time without any way of measuring the effects.

Nowhere is the obtuseness of this idealistic approach more evident than in U.S. promotion of LGBT policies abroad. Without applying any moral calculus, a realist approach to foreign affairs requires accepting that LGBT rights likely will never be accepted by all the people of the world, no matter how many millions of dollars we pour into foreign LGBT organizations.

It is difficult to fathom U.S. expenditures significantly changing minds in Africa and Asia about homosexual marriage or LGBT legal preferences. But even aside from pragmatic concerns, promoting LGBT preferences abroad is more likely to cause backlash against the very people it is intended to help, besides harming our standing in the world, as recent events show.

The Human Costs of the LGBT Political Pressure

Regardless of where you stand on LGBT issues, everyone agrees human beings should be protected from violence and unjust discrimination, including when they subjectively identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or otherwise. But international coercion from the United States on LGBT issues can only lead to more violence and unjust discrimination.

Sadly, extreme LGBT ideologues do not accept reality. As the Masterpiece Cakeshop Supreme Court case shows, their goal, domestically and globally, is to impose social acceptance of homosexuality and transgenderism even on those unwilling to celebrate it. Inevitably, they are running into some roadblocks.

The Human Rights Campaign is enraged that Egypt may enact a law that punishes waving the rainbow flag or otherwise promoting LGBT behavior. Yet Egypt is just the latest example in a global streak of laws and enforcement actions to chastise sodomy, homosexual lewdness, and LGBT advocacy, as the Washington Post reported last fall. African countries, Russia and ex-Soviet nations, as well as Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, and other Asian nations with significant Muslim populations, have all responded to increased pressure about LGBT policies during the Obama administration with punitive laws, policies to protect children from homosexual propaganda, and even police crackdowns on LGBT establishments and social circles.

Although socially traditional, most of the countries where the backlash is hardest were never hotbeds of anti-gay sentiment, or especially dangerous for individuals who led an LGBT double life. They became so as a result of the relentless international pressure on LGBT issues from the U.S. State Department during the Obama administration, United Nations (UN) bureaucrats, the European Union, huge corporations, and LGBT groups backed by billionaires and western governments.

Some LGBT advocates want to blame this crackdown on U.S. evangelicals who “export homophobia.” But this is simply false. Not only is U.S. evangelical influence abroad grossly exaggerated, the backlash is visceral and from the grassroots. In Africa, it is immediate, spontaneous, and self-sustaining. The LGBT issue is highly politicized instantly, as Tanzania’s recent “crackdown” arrests of gay people show. And the reaction was immediately severe even in countries that are generally quite tolerant of LGTB lifestyles, as in Latin America.

This agenda antagonizes populations with traditional social norms and creates dangers for individuals who identify as LGBT. In some cases, U.N. and U.S. support for advocates makes them a target.

Local Advocates Say Western Pressure Is Dangerous

Indeed, all along, LGBT advocates in Africa and Asia denounced international pressure for LGBT policies as dangerous to the very people these policies are intended to protect. A comprehensive New York Times report on the backlash in Africa quoted LGBT-identified individuals saying “U.S. support is making matters worse.” But such warnings have fallen on deaf ears.

Indeed, the Maccabean reaction aggressive LGBT advocacy elicits in these countries was entirely foreseeable, as cooler heads realized during the Bush presidency, when U.S. LGBT diplomacy was prudently overshadowed by a broader concern for civil and political freedom.

If individuals who identify as LGBT in Egypt end up in prison or dead as a result of this backlash, LGBT advocates have only themselves to blame. Did LGBT activists really think the entire world would simply acquiesce to their demands? Incredibly, the answer seems to be yes.

The LGBT agenda is “unstoppable,” unrealistic activists like to say. They actually believe all of the roughly 70 countries that still punish sodomy will at some point embrace and promote homoerotic propaganda. They even seem to believe all countries will legally recognize homosexual unions. They should know better.

Christianity and Islam, and even Buddhism, Confucianism, and Hinduism to some extent, just to name the most populous of world religions, do not look upon homosexuality favorably and are unlikely to ever change on this matter, even if popular western culture seeks to undermine them. Just this week Pope Francis condemned “ideological colonialism” in his annual speech to ambassadors to the Holy See from all around the world. Everyone understood this as criticism of the United States and Europe promoting LGBT ideology abroad.

Not all Is Well at Foggy Bottom

Under Obama’s presidency, LGBT policies seemed to became the highest priority of the U.S. State Department. We have pressured countries to stop opposing LGBT policies at the United Nations. We have boasted of twisting diplomats’ arms to get them to back off defending their laws and social norms, sacrificing other U.S. foreign policy priorities and further widening the democratic deficit at the UN.

We’ve poured millions of dollars into organizations that promote LGBT policies abroad. We have proudly flown the rainbow flag and hosted pride events in our embassies all around the world, even in countries where it is considered offensive. Our ambassadors parade in LGBT pride events, causing consternation and offense.

We have boasted of twisting diplomats’ arms to get them to back off defending their laws and social norms, sacrificing other U.S. foreign policy priorities.

We have stood silently by as UN bureaucrats and legal experts misrepresent and lie about international law. They say it protects unfettered sexual autonomy in the same way it protects religious freedom. In fact, international law only protects sexual autonomy in the context of the right to marry and found a family. Sodomy is simply not protected by international law, and will likely never be, regardless of what UN bureaucrats say.

Most egregiously, during the Obama years the United States asked repeatedly to scrap the part of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights about the family as “natural and fundamental group unit of society” in U.N. documents. The reason is simple. Under this standard, international law does not recognize homosexual relations as capable of constituting a family.

Although LGBT advocacy has lessened under the Trump administration, the United States has yet to officially change position on most of these matters. Those pushing this agenda are deeply embedded in the U.S. State Department and still carrying the momentum of the Obama years, dictating many U.S. positions in international negotiations.

Just last summer, the United States voted against a Human Rights Council resolution on the role the family plays in assisting children who are disabled, because it included the language from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The U.S. Missions to the UN in both Geneva and New York have made several unguarded statements in support of the LGBT agenda at the United Nations.

The United States is still part of the “LGBT Core Group” at the United Nations—a group of two dozen states committed to keeping LGBT issues on the UN agenda. On December 10, to mark International Human Rights Day, the State Department once again promoted transgenderism as a marquee human rights issue.

The Institutional Costs of LGBT Advocacy

Until fairly recently, LGBT advocacy from western governments was sporadic. Although there have been attempts since the 1990s to create a protected category of “sexual orientation” alongside sex, race, and religion at the United Nations, they never went far. To this day the only UN General Assembly resolution that includes “sexual orientation and gender identity” is a resolution on extrajudicial killings. Even though it is hardly something states want to be associated with, 60 countries voted against including this terminology in 2016.

During the Obama administration, especially in the final two years, LGBT issues became more public and politically divisive at the United Nations and in capitals around the world. Delegates routinely complained about the relentless LGBT pressure from the Obama administration.

This acrimony is bad for the United Nations and bad for human rights. It is hard enough to hold UN member states accountable for established human rights obligations.

Now, LGBT policies are increasingly no longer only addressed behind closed doors in small rooms at Foggy Bottom and Turtle Bay. They are debated in UN conference rooms. Politicians and UN diplomats are held accountable for their positions. It should have been self-evident that once the LGBT issue came out it would be weaponized politically. The backlash we have seen last year alone, both domestically and internationally, is highly indicative that countries are treating this as an important political issue.

This global politicization makes it impossible and entirely unrealistic to hope that continuing to thrust the issue either bilaterally or at the United Nations will lead to a pleasant resolution. It will only contribute further erosion of goodwill. It will also result in more acrimony between UN member states and undermine international law. It will also lead to more antipathy, violence, and unjust discrimination against individuals who identify as LGBT.

Already, the issue has polarized the UN system like never before. Last year, the Human Rights Council established the first UN post with a mandate to address violence and discrimination on “sexual orientation and gender identity.” That mandate was contested all the way to a very close vote in the General Assembly, despite an herculean effort of the Obama administration to get countries to not show up to vote according to their own laws. Nearly half the General Assembly subsequently declared it does not consider the mandate legitimate.

This is a very bad precedent. This acrimony is bad for the United Nations and bad for human rights. It is hard enough to hold UN member states accountable for established human rights obligations. Playing fast and loose with international human rights to elevate unfettered sexual autonomy as a protected human rights category hardly helps. If UN experts and a few powerful nations can manufacture, through international pressure, new human rights obligations that countries never agreed to, it simply gives bad actors a further reason to check out of human rights altogether.

It is Time to Cut Our Losses and Get Out

The State Department should not be peddling LGBT fantasies as legitimate foreign policy. It should severely dial back the LGBT pressure and reset on more attainable and less controversial goals. All-out LGBT diplomacy was always a losing proposition. It should have never happened. Cleaning up this mess will require significant changes.

Ultimately, promoting LGBT rights internationally is a social engineering feat the likes of which has never been seen. It is not feasible politically, culturally, or fiscally. Regardless of how one feels about Obergefell or Masterpiece Cakeshop, it is bad foreign policy to expect the rest of the world to submit to Justice Kennedy’s interpretation of the U.S. Constitution as if it were binding international law.

Holding the entire world hostage until we get international recognition of homosexual relations is not only pointless because such recognition is unlikely to ever happen, it is not endearing the United States to the rest of the world, including countries we need as allies. The U.S. State Department should be pragmatic. We need to cut our losses and bail out of this global LGBT fiasco before more people get hurt.

The ‘First Trans Murder Of 2018’ Was Not A Hate Crime,"A homicide in Massachusetts during the first week of the new year has caused a great deal of anxiety. The murder, the first in the town of North Adams since 2013, occurred at the victim’s home. Mark Steele-Knudslien, the husband of 42-year-old Christa Leigh Steele-Knudslien, confessed to murdering Christa. He was arrested after turning himself in at the police station.

No motive has been released. A detail in the case has, however, made it stand out far more prominently than it otherwise would have: Christa was transgender. The Human Rights Campaign tweeted out on the murder, stating, “A tragic start to the new year. We mourn the loss of Christa Leigh Steele-Knudslien, whose death is now the first reported murder of a trans person in 2018.”

The comments to the tweet included pleas to end “hatred and ignorance” and the hope that 2018 will be less dangerous for transgender Americans than 2017 was. 2017 has been labeled the “deadliest year for transgender people” due to its 28 murders of transgender individuals. But like the above case, the person’s gender identity was not a known factor in any of the murders. The killings were an assortment of homicides ranging from random acts of violence to robbery to domestic violence. In the same way, Christa’s murder appears to be domestic violence.

In a strange interpretation of community identity, LGBT media and advocacy groups connect all violence or insult towards anyone LGBT as a direct attack on all LGBT people, regardless of the motive. If a transgender person is murdered, it is presented as a hate crime and collected with other transgender murders. The list becomes evidence of an overall threat, to transgender people specifically and LGBT people generally, requiring awareness and action.

If Disparity Is the Issue, Why Ignore Domestic Violence?

The HRC is well aware of the effects of tweeting “the first reported murder of a trans person in 2018,” as LGBT people have become accustomed to outrage and anxiety over anti-trans violence. Taken at face value, it appears some LGBT advocacy groups consider even the most remote possibility of a hate crime important enough to rally around. They believe in an outside threat with such conviction that they report any evidence that can be construed to support this belief.

From their perspective, it is vital these murders are well-known and widely reported to highlight what they believe are ongoing problems of equality and safety. Thus it becomes relevant to ask why much larger concerns of violence within the LGBT community do not receive the same attention.

The rate of domestic violence for LGBT people is astonishingly high. From The Advocate, a gay-oriented publication, in 2014:

The National Violence Against Women survey found that 21.5 percent of men and 35.4 percent of women living with a same-sex partner experienced intimate-partner physical violence in their lifetimes, compared with 7.1 percent and 20.4 percent for men and women, respectively, with a history of only opposite-sex cohabitation. Transgender respondents had an incidence of 34.6 percent over a lifetime according to a Massachusetts survey. In 2010 the CDC reported that 43.8 percent of lesbians, 61.1 percent of bisexual women, 26 percent of gay men, and 37.3 percent of bisexual men experienced sexual assault, stalking or other physical violence from intimate partners.

The Advocate recognizes a concern here: “Myths about domestic violence, victims’ fear and shame, a silence that stems from a desire not to harm perceptions of the LGBT community — all these together contribute to making the problem invisible to others.”

LGBT people as a whole faced extremely low hate crime rates, at 0.001 percent yearly according to FBI reports. About 1.4 million Americans identify as transgender, and 28 transgender people were murdered in 2017. But more than half of all women who engage in same-sex relationships report domestic violence.

It is shocking that LGBT media and advocacy groups obsess endlessly over hate crimes, bullying, and anti-LGBT attitudes when such a dramatic issue is directly in front of them inside their own community. As The Advocate article implies, PR concerns appear to influence this decision.

The Persecution Narrative Serves a Political Purpose

Identity politics involve a remarkably vital need to maintain a specific public narrative to remain important in the national discussion. LGBT organizations would have very little to do if most gay and transgender people stopped looking to them for guidance and simply lived their lives. These organizations need to focus on threats that inspire action, outrage, and, most importantly, attention from the media. The high rate of LGBT domestic violence invites unwanted scrutiny, whereas “the deadliest year for transgender people” inspires sympathy and a continued seat at the national table.

The LGBT movement was founded to battle outside threats to members’ freedoms and rights. Later it became fundamentally important to gain widespread social acceptance and legitimacy. Today the focus seems to be loudly shouting at the smallest offense or reporting the most remote and isolated act of violence as an immediate threat to all LGBT people across the nation.

While there is nothing particularly wrong with highlighting the murder of a member of one’s tribe and mourning together in solidarity, it does matter when that murder is used for political purposes. LGBT media and advocacy groups will include Christa in their annual list of “transgender murders” to perpetuate the false narrative of a dangerous environment for transgender individuals in our country. Christa’s death will be included in the statistics that influence public policy.

Lying About Their Stories Does Victims No Justice

We require accurate statistics, and those who do face genuine hate crimes are diminished by linking their stories with random violence due solely to a shared sexual or gender identity. More importantly, victims like Christa get ignored in the domestic violence discussion when their deaths are politicized. Instead of focusing on funding, advocacy, and awareness campaigns that may have helped Christa, LGBT groups will instead continue fighting a threat that simply does not exist.

Every murder is tragic, and each victim deserves to be remembered, just as their murderers deserve just punishment. But no one is honored by having his or her name associated with a lie. Sadly, the LGBT world will view this crime as another attack on them, ignoring the relevant context and details, and experience a personal sense of tragedy and fear.

Perpetuating fear keeps advocacy alive and well-funded. Intentionally misleading the public for a greater cause currently has no consequence or repercussion. Despite the reality that this murder is likely a case of domestic violence, something a large portion of LGBT Americans report experiencing, very few will recognize this as a legitimate concern.

Somehow, the specter of anti-transgender hate and violent intent inspires more outrage, advocacy, and anxiety than the truth of LGBT domestic violence and the threat of intimate partner abuse. As profoundly disturbing as it sounds, it is entirely political. The political narrative thrives on fear more than action, and that is the motivation behind all LGBT organizations today.

LGBT Activists Can’t See What’s Wrong With A 9-Year-Old Drag Queen,"Brandon Hilton, owner of an online clothing store specializing in erotic clothing, recently announced that nine-year-old drag queen Lactatia was his company’s newest “cover girl.” He tweeted, “I think this new generation of drag kids is brilliant and inspiring! @Desmond_Amazing and Lactatia are the future! @TheHouseofMann is just making sure they look SICKENING! People will talk no matter what, might as well give them something FIERCE to look at!”

Hilton received an immediate and overwhelming backlash as people reacted angrily to the appearance of him sexualizing a child. He responded, “woke up to countless tweets telling me to ‘kill yourself’ and calling me a ‘pedo’ after we announced 9 year old drag superstar Lactatia as our new HOUSE OF MANN covergirl… if you can’t handle a kid in a sequin onesie, maybe the future isn’t for you.”

Hilton messaged me on Twitter after I challenged him to explain why he would encourage the sexualization of a child as an LGBT activist. Although his tweets seem to celebrate children engaging in these adult activities, he seemed profoundly disturbed by the accusations. He believed the outrage came from ignorance and hatred by “right-wing propaganda.” While I think he did not intend to sexualize the child or promote pedophilia, I also think he cannot understand how his actions did just that.

Why Kids Are So Important to the LGBT Left

The images of the young boy are undeniably adult in nature, from the make-up to the posing, to the facial expressions. The boy is emulating an adult woman being sexually provocative. He has seen this behavior and body language in his drag queen mentors.

Drag is an inherently adult form of entertainment, meant to exaggerate female sexuality using humor and vulgarity. The sexuality within the artform cannot be separated out and therefore many oppose minors, and certainly children, participating in it.

Since LGBT people first celebrated the boy, he has been a symbol of a movement crossing a line. While those on the Right are quick to assert pedophilia as a motivation behind this movement, it is more rooted in sexual and gender theory that relies on children for validation.

Children expressing sexuality or gender identity that deviates from the norm are viewed as proof that this deviancy is inborn. And society is more likely to accommodate inborn traits than freely made adult choices. While LGBT Americans have full rights and are arguably widely celebrated in every sector, the LGBT Left has fixated on encouraging sexual expression in ever younger children. They genuinely believe they are helping these children by allowing them to “be themselves” in an environment free from judgment or repression.

The LGBT Left also believes denying one’s “true self,” which is often revealed in childhood, leads to homelessness, drug abuse, and suicide. They believe they are saving these children from a life of bullying, fear, and crippling anxiety. So any child who emulates LGBT culture is widely celebrated and promoted. A nine-year-old boy dressing and behaving as an adult drag queen is seen as beautiful and progressive.

An Identity Defined by Sexuality Struggles to Express Itself Differently

In June 2017, The Advocate, a major LGBT advocacy website and magazine, celebrated Lactacia. The boy has become a celebrity in the LGBT world. Hilton believed he was promoting and celebrating a young boy he considers inspiring to his identity group.

The LGBT world often struggles to separate its sexually explicit culture from its advocacy for equality and rights. In many ways they are incapable of understanding why the outside world would be appalled by explicitly sexual public displays. For them it must be out of malice, hatred, or ignorance rather than reasonable aversion.

Gay pride parades have long been extreme public displays of every form of sexual deviancy imaginable. Gay liberals see no distinction between their sexual selves and their everyday selves. They celebrate the merger of the two as identity and culture.

The consequence here is that Hilton and the LGBT world will never be able to fully appreciate the damage being done to a generation of children pushed to grow up faster. The LGBT Left’s intense focus on labeling then exploiting LGBT children holds incredible risk and threatens their futures. Early sexual activity and expression can be devastating to young people, especially LGBT youth. High rates of drug abuse, sexual abuse, and risky sexual behavior are common. HIV rates are extremely high for gay and bisexual young men aged 13 to 24. Nearly 40 percent of homeless youth identify as LGBT, with higher risks of drug use and sex work.

While the LGBT world may not be intentionally trying to harm children or put them at risk, it is time leaders of the movement fully recognize the dangers of using young children to validate their sexual politics. To help further this discussion, we must be careful not to abuse the term “pedophile.” Overuse will diminish the impact of our message and make it more difficult to fight the legitimate scourge of child sexual abuse rampant around the world.

What we must do is call out the dangers of sexualizing children too early, making them vulnerable to people who do wish to exploit and abuse them. LGBT advocacy groups have a responsibility to recognize that every form of sexuality and gender identity can be freely enjoyed by adults in private, but should never involve children regardless of the context or motivation. While they intend to celebrate the uniqueness of the child, they in effect steal the child’s innocence and impose an adult identity onto him, all to validate their own insecurities. We cannot stay quiet and allow more children to lose their childhood to the dreams of progressives who only imagine the future while failing to grasp the trauma they impose in the present.

"District Pays Teen $800,000 For Refusing To Let Her Sleep With Boys","A Wisconsin school district will pay a transgender student $800,000 to settle a lawsuit she filed in a successful attempt to share bathrooms and overnight sleeping quarters with male high school students. Ash Whitaker’s attorneys will get $650,000 of that amount, and she gets the rest. The money will be paid out by the district’s insurance company, after using taxpayer dollars for their $25,000 deductible.

Before the settlement, the case had been appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court after the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Whitaker’s favor. The court agreed that Kenosha Unified School District “illegally singled Whitaker out for discrimination because he [sic] is transgender.” Whitaker also demanded to be allowed to run for prom king, and won that fight last year as well.

“[Whitaker’s] claimed fees were $1.7 million, so we estimated if we went up to the Supreme Court, and/or back down to trial court to try the case and go through anything, that their fees would be somewhere between $4 million and $5 million,” Kenosha’s attorney, Ron Stadler, told media. “So, it becomes a real economic decision in terms of balancing risks and the downside of being given an adverse decision.”

The Seventh Circuit unanimously decided that a “policy that requires an individual to use a bathroom that does not conform with his or her gender identity . . . violates Title IX,” a law requiring educational institutions that take federal money to treat males and females the same. It was the first time any federal appeals court concluded that the 1972 statute’s phrase “sex discrimination” means “gender identity discrimination.”

LGBT activists have targeted the courts and regulatory agencies as vehicles to rewrite federal laws, primarily by changing the definitions of words in this same fashion. President Obama’s Department of Education issued regulatory guidance similar to the Seventh Circuit’s reading, telling schools they had to interpret the word “sex” to include “gender identity,” which inserted LGBT preferences into laws that Congress did not intend to include LGBT preferences.

“Sex,” of course, refers to biological sex — i.e., the fact of being male or female. “Gender identity” is fundamentally opposed to the concept of biological sex because it is a philosophical system that declares sex distinctions — XX and XY chromosomes and the myriad biological effects they create — invalid and meaningless. The two phrases not only do not mean the same thing, they often mean opposite things. Yet courts and regulatory agencies are beginning to substitute one for the other with no legal grant of authority to do so from Congress.

Making national rules in this fashion, of course, upends representative government, because unelected officials run courts and regulatory agencies. So using both avenues unelected officials have been overriding the will of the people as expressed in law through their elected representatives.

This sort of regulatory law-rewriting also ends the rule of law. In a free and just society, laws are few, imposed by the consent of the governed, apply equally to all people, and come into existence by a set and known system of rules. This allows for people to govern themselves through a free and fair process, rather than be ruled by others in a secretive process in which only some have the power and the rest of us must obey. This regulatory rewrite of Title IX uses the latter style of government, and our administrative state doesn’t just exhibit these characteristics regarding Title IX, either. This is its main mode of governance.

The rule of law is one of the fundamental conditions for a free society. Arbitrary rule is a core hallmark of tinpot dictatorships and banana republics. It is unjust and unequal because it privileges the wealthy and well-connected. Its only alternative is tyranny — either the petty tyranny of unelected bureaucrats or the dramatic tyranny of dictatorship. Guess which one the United States is now.

Only heightening this core problem of process, of course, is the one of content. Whitaker is not a man or a boy and never will be. She’s a teen who has gotten herself local and national notoriety, set both counterfactual and un-American legal precedents, and is now $150,000 richer, all by selling lies about human biology. That’s another thing rule by bureaucrats fosters: not just state coercion, but a higher likelihood of that coercion consisting of harmful untruths.

When it is possible to use government power to force people into actions or beliefs, especially those against common sense and cultural tradition, abuse of that power is more likely. Human history proves repeatedly that perfectly normal people will do perfectly horrible things when given too much power over others. Consider the legacies of slavery and the Holocaust. Rank-and-file slave owners and Nazis were ordinary people with families, pets, hobbies, neighbors, and jobs. Yet they did horrible things to fellow human beings when given the power and the opportunity, just like the famous psychological tests showing ordinary people will administer homicidal electric shocks to innocent fellow men at the direction of an authority figure.

Humans cannot be trusted with power. We all abuse whatever power we have in some way or another, and the more we get, the bigger the temptation to abuse it. This is why we need the rule of law: to restrain our inherent tendencies to abuse others, even with benign intentions. The rule of law under a system of self-government forces people with power to justify their actions to those they are supposed to serve. It keeps them honest. Destroying it, with which Whitaker’s lawsuit assists, will lead to real abuses of our fellow Americans far beyond letting a girl hang around urinals.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/01/16/school-district-pays-teen-800000-refusing-let-sleep-micturate-boys/,2018-01-16
Let’s Get Real: There Are No Risks To Traveling The U.S. While Queer,"I recently took a road trip with my boyfriend from West Virginia to the Gulf Coast of Florida, traveling through Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia, then back up through Tennessee and Kentucky. I discovered many inconvenient truths about the people I encountered. First, let’s consider the perspective of another LGBT couple in a similar situation. Joanne Spataro wrote a New York Times article titled “The Risks of Traveling While Queer.”

“When my girlfriend, Lara, and I travel on the road, we have to take precautions,” Spataro writes. “We’re constantly on guard against strangers. Lara is a transgender woman of color, and at rest stops I’m never far from her side…Lara doesn’t want to stop at gas stations, and she’ll have me pump gas so that no one can see her and try to size her up.”

Joanne writes of an emotionally disturbing experience when stopping at a gas station felt extraordinarily unsafe: “As I filled the tank and Lara sat in the car, I saw a group of people who could have been extras on ‘Duck Dynasty’ gathered by two pickup trucks. I could feel them glaring at us.”

After leaving the station, Joanne noticed one of the trucks pulled out behind them and followed them down the highway. They turned on their high beams and apparently got off the same exit. At the exit, Lara begged Joanne to stop until the truck disappeared. The truck turned to the right, no longer following them.

They quickly got back on the highway where, Joanne says, “I allowed myself to cry and smack the dashboard in angry relief. In that moment, my life more than flashed before my eyes; it was almost gone in the flash of a headlight.”

She goes on to describe this experience of “harassment” in context of the rise in LGBT hate crimes amid Donald Trump’s presidency. She argues that LGBT travelers need “traveler’s guides that provide information on a county-by-county level about what travelers may encounter while they’re driving in these areas.” She concludes her essay longing for a day when “Lara and I – and countless other L.G.B.T.Q. people – can enjoy safe travel across the United States.”

This Was Impossible for Me to Replicate

In comparison, what was my experience like traveling through the same parts of the country? I stopped at multiple stores that displayed Confederate flag memorabilia, and drove past a very large and prominent Confederate flag along the highway in Georgia. In North Carolina, I stood nearly 10 feet away from several men who sported country attire. One had a rebel flag on his T-shirt.

I passed dozens upon dozens of Christian billboards, signs, and other public displays in every state in which I traveled. I saw the phrase “Jesus Loves You” everywhere I went, and multiple billboards asked, “Where Will You End Up?” with images of Heaven and Hell below.

I traveled alone through Virginia, down through the Carolinas, into Georgia, and through rural Florida, wearing my yarmulke the entire way. After picking up my boyfriend from the airport and spending some time at several theme parks, we drove back up through Georgia, Tennessee, and Kentucky before returning home to West Virginia.

Alone, I walked into multiple gas stations along the highway, and several rest stops. During the trip we visited local attractions, held hands through a theme park and two aquariums, showed affection along the way, and even posed to have a couple portrait drawn. The way home featured a stop at a rural antique shop, more gas stations, restaurants, and rest stops.

While checking out in a North Carolina gas station, a man standing behind me greeted me and asked where I was headed. I told him, without thinking twice about it, “I’m headed to Florida to pick up my boyfriend and spend a week’s vacation along the Gulf Coast.”

It should go without saying that I experienced absolutely no problems. The inconvenient truth I mentioned relates to the difference between how those on the Left imagine average America and what average America is really like. The truth is, while not everyone agrees with how I choose to live or how they perceive who I am, very few choose to express their disapproval. Certainly no one seems particularly interested in intimidating me for the sheer enjoyment of it.

This Scary Incident Could Easily Have Been Made Up

Reading Joanne’s account demonstrates to a liberal a fearful confession of helplessness and trauma caused by intimidation and bullying. While simply wishing to travel freely in their own home state, they encounter cruelty and discrimination.

But from a rational perspective, it appears the entire encounter happened exclusively in their own minds. The women described how they perceived the others around them while assuming malice and hatred. They spot living stereotypes, precisely as they described them, engaging in behavior and motivation exactly as they imagined they would.

As they drive, they imagine the truck is following them and its lights indicate intentional threats to their safety. They break down under the stress of what they have just hallucinated was a life-threatening encounter with the exact type of enemy the LGBT media obsessively warns is waiting for them around every corner. This one experience reveals and validates very fear and anxiety they hold.

It is more likely the travelers they encountered did not even notice them. Joanne stated she “felt” the others were glaring at her and Lara, but describes no actual engagement. Two women in a car is not particularly interesting to most people. Lara, perpetually paranoid about others’ potential reactions, never indicates how random passersby even know Lara is transgender.

As for the truck’s intimidating behavior, this sounds far more like a classic narrative trope from civil rights-era films of southern racists intimidating black individuals. The reality is, on a dark highway in rural America, everyone uses his high-beams to better see the surroundings and watch for deer. It is common to see a car approaching from behind with high-beams on that switches lanes and passes if the driver feels you are going too slow. Certainly, the fact the truck driver turned onto the exit they randomly chose for an escape without continuing to follow them should have indicated a simple misunderstanding. I would bet the truckers involved never even considered this couple at all.

In Psychology, This Is Called Projection

The Left has a profoundly disturbing habit of asserting their personal perception of their surroundings is proof of some grand truth about society. The writer describes a rise in LGBT people reporting harassment immediately after describing as “harassment” a perfectly innocent encounter on the highway with an unknown driver who never once engaged with her and her partner. She was clearly prepared to be victimized and therefore was easily susceptible to confirmation bias when a nicely-fitting scenario presented itself.

Joanne imposes the very judgement and prejudice she fears onto them based solely on how they look to her.

Sadly, she never considered the individuals she accuses of such disturbing and malicious behavior. In her worldview, they were already guilty. Joanne imposes the very judgement and prejudice she fears onto them based solely on how they look to her.

The people I encountered throughout the South were perfectly average individuals in every way during our encounter. Cashiers, waiters, retail staff, the artist drawing our photo, and every other person we came across behaved politely and within the normal limits of engaging with strangers. My yarmulke and boyfriend never seemed to affect the equation. He and I are neither shy about our affection nor overly demonstrative, but it is easy to tell we are a couple. We never once felt threatened.

For me this is the fundamental difference between minorities on the Right and on the Left. While the Left assumes guilt, the Right assumes normalcy unless proven otherwise. I also do not expect most people to be cruel, homophobic, or anti-Semitic, so if I happen to encounter a person who is any of these things I view him as a strange outlier. Joanne and most of the LGBT world view it as proof of their overall belief in the generalized bigotry of the American population.

Suspicions Can Create Animosity Where There Was None

It is possible that two women cautiously approaching a gas station, one darting her eyes and head back and forth, eyeing her environment while the other runs around the car to frantically get gas as quickly as possible, might raise some eyebrows. If people behave strangely, other people will notice and be suspicious. If these women were to simply approach each new situation with an assumption of normalcy, they would likely find most people friendly, polite, or generally uninterested in them. Attitude matters, and when a person is looking for a fight, he or she will generally find conflict.

The more the LGBT Left spreads fear like this, the more LGBT individuals will anticipate hatred and bigotry in otherwise innocent strangers.

The more the LGBT Left spreads fear like this, the more LGBT individuals will anticipate hatred and bigotry in otherwise innocent strangers, behaving suspiciously or hostilely. Naturally this will cause others to respond with equal suspicion and possible hostility, validating the self-fulfilling fears of the LGBT individuals. The LGBT Left is so determined to see the worst in humanity, they manufacture it from whole cloth and report it as repeated, factual experience.

The vast majority of people are good, kind, and perfectly normal individuals who simply do not care about the various minority statuses of those around them. Routine normalcy should outweigh the far rarer report of outrageous intimidation or abuse. I challenge people to think back to the last time they witnessed a bigoted, hateful, or outright abusive attack on a minority in an otherwise everyday situation.

If this continues, people will begin to resent being the anonymous villains of liberal victim fantasies used solely to perpetuate political narratives. In the meantime, LGBT individuals’ obsession with victimhood denies them the simple joy of enjoying normalcy and equality in everyday life. They miss out on the comforting realization that few care who you are and only care who you are to them.

In the most free and accepting time for LGBT people in our nation’s history, they choose to imagine what oppression must be like instead. They create their own anxiety, fear, and sense of discrimination. In my experience, the only person aware of my minority status is me. Everyone else could not care less.

California's LGBT Travel Ban Bars Students From NASA Competition,"Students belonging to a rocketry club at a California community college won’t be allowed to compete in NASA’s highly competitive Student Launch project due to a the state’s new LGBT-spurred travel ban. It appears the Citrus College Rocket Owls — who qualified to participate in NASA’s project in Huntsville, Alabama — won’t be able to make it thanks to AB 1887, which bars taxpayer dollars from being spent on travel to states with laws with “discriminatory legislation.”

What constitutes LGBT “discrimination” appears to be up to state agencies to decide. So far, they’ve decided it includes laws allowing private foster agencies to prioritize placing children with married heterosexual couples. In some states, such agencies, which are primarily religious, provide large numbers of foster placements for distressed children and banning their charitable efforts means huge overloads for social services. A Kentucky law allowing private student organizations to uphold teachings about sexuality in line with their stated religious beliefs also got it placed under California’s travel ban.

Teams from three other California universities will travel to the competition in April, but use private funds to do so, according to Arleigh Davis, at the Citrus College Clarion. Math professor Paul Swatzel has donated $500 to the Owls in hopes they will be able to attend the event if they can pay for travel expenses out of pocket, ABC7 reports.

It is unclear if Citrus College will allow these students to compete and if they will be able to privately fund their attempt to represent the school.

“I respect the California Department of Education for taking a stand against discrimination, but it doesn’t benefit the people in the eight states with the ban, and it is only hurting California students,” Rocket Owl team member Austin Langrehr told the Clarion.

"To Placate LGBT Lobby, Harvard Ends Single-Sex Student Clubs","Harvard University is seen widely as one of the preeminent higher-education institutions in the country. But away from the books, the college is taking a highly political stance targeting Greek life that only regresses its offerings to students and the country.

The school recently banned single-sex organizations. That means sororities and fraternities may cease to exist in the traditional sense. In fact, it’s already happening. Under the threats of sanctions from university officials, Harvard’s Kappa Kappa Gamma has disaffiliated from its national chapter.

Now, recruits can join Fleur-de-Lis, “a gender-neutral” group focused on self-identified females. The school newspaper, The Crimson, published an editorial in December lauding this forced change. Editors claimed it emboldens fraternities and sororities to combat the power and influence of all-male student groups on campus, referred to as “white, male, and affluent.”

Nothing champions diversity more than stereotyping on the basis of sex and race, I guess. One would have hoped scholars who’ve scored in the highest ranges on college entrance exams to understand that truth. Fortunately, some of them have. Three sororities have refused to comply with the new edict. Those strong-willed women, however, risk forfeiting the opportunity to captain athletic teams and becoming ineligible for campus leadership positions and school endorsements for academic fellowships.

Forcing People to Agree Is Just Plain Wrong

Props to those who resisted. Yes, there’s that word: resistance, the term championed by social justice warriors displeased with the current White House administration. Now, like karma, it’s coming back around.

Here’s a thought: if you want to focus on females, keep the storied sorority chapters that actually focus on females. Sorry to break it to the extreme Left, but there is no such thing as “gender neutrality.” There is, and always will be, just two human sexes.

Transgender activists often find themselves at odds with conservatives because many insist that respecting and loving a person requires agreeing with his or her views in every detail. That’s not true, however, and I’ve experienced this personally. One of my closest friends for ten years just transitioned from a female to a male.

It’s my friend’s life and decision, and the struggles my friend faced in making that choice came with heavy burdens. I remain this person’s friend because it is possible to exhibit inclusion and respect individual freedoms, no matter one’s beliefs. You can accept someone’s choices without being forced to agree with him.

During college, I was both a Tri Delta and a student athlete. Both entities taught invaluable lessons on camaraderie, friendship, and tolerance. It goes without saying that 40 young women in one room presents a fair share of disagreements. But that’s one of the beauties of Greek sisterhood. You learn to come together despite your disagreements, and shame on Harvard for trying to rip that apart.

Students Are Capable of Sorting This Out Themselves

I held leadership positions both in my sorority and athletic team. Having to balance those responsibilities ingrained a work ethic that’s lasted into adulthood. The young women who reject Harvard’s ridiculous social rules may not have that same opportunity.

I played soccer alongside a few lesbian teammates. Newsflash, Harvard: nobody in that locker room cared. We all cared about each other as sisters, just like sorority members do. According to the school, only dismantling sex-specific association can make possible what we accomplished naturally. What’s next? Will intercollegiate athletic match-ups now be called “gender-neutral?”

If that happened, wouldn’t Title IX, a federal law that states, “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance,” cease to exist? If there’s no basis for sex identification, then why have a law that’s expanded female athletics for the better part of 36 years?

Harvard should see the bigger picture from another angle, too. Look into the philanthropy these sororities and fraternities do for their communities. Tri Delta raised $7 million in 2015 for St. Jude Children’ Research Hospital. Kappa Kappa Gamma, the sorority Harvard’s chapter disaffiliated from, has chapters across the country. Some have partnered with Amazon to raise money for book donations, for their Reading Is Fundamental campaign. Harvard should be ashamed of actively trying to break apart young women contributing to great causes simply because they are women.

LGBT Left Attempts To Stamp Out Dissenting Medical Professionals,"The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recently proposed a rule that would allow medical professionals to opt out of performing procedures that may violate their consciences.

In response, the Human Rights Campaign’s legal director, Sarah Warbelow, stated, “Every American deserves access to medically necessary health care, and that health care should not be determined by the personal opinions of individual health care providers or administrative staff.”

The Left has long attempted to coerce people into their beliefs about sexuality by repeating the claim that sex-change treatments are “medically necessary.” By asserting elective medical options are “necessary” and nesting them in the generalized notion of “health care,” the Left effectively marginalizes any criticism. Repeating this theme with indignant passion and assumed authority removes responsibility from the Left to justify their arguments.

The Left wishes the general public to view all aspects of transgender medical options as positive and healthy. Unable to convince the public through open discourse, the Left has chosen to simply overwhelm opposition using emotionally powerful phrases and outrage.

The Question Is Whether a Sex-Change Is Elective

The issue is complicated. On the one hand, it seems reasonable that a medical professional who morally opposes certain elective medical procedures should be free to refuse to perform them. On the other hand, it is unnerving to imagine being denied necessary medical treatment based solely on the personal choice of your physician.

It comes down to an issue of semantics. The Left strongly opposes referring to sex-reassignment surgery as “elective” and insists on placing it in the same category as heart surgery. In doing so they intercept any argument of personal conscience. However, if understood as elective, it becomes much easier to advocate for personal choice in the matter.

The language from the LGBT Left is clear: if President Trump is allowed to impose this new rule, doctors across the country will begin freely denying LGBT people access to health care they need. This concept exploits fears about the Trump administration. The Left has assigned the phrase “anti-LGBT” to the rule change, as they have imposed onto every religious freedom bill proposed in recent years. Back in 2014, the Huffington Post wrote of an Arizona religious freedom measure, “pharmacists could refuse HIV and hormone replacement therapy drugs.”

In truth, the rule is largely designed to protect medical doctors who oppose abortion, religious organizations opposed to birth control, and medical professionals opposed to a wide range of transgender procedures. The transgender procedures in question fall into the realm of surgeries, hormone treatments, and transitioning children.

The Presented Dangers Are Highly Unlikely to Materialize

Framing this as “medically necessary treatment for LGBT people” presents it as something profoundly affecting all gay and transgender Americans. Oddly, the LGBT Left often refers to LGBT health care as though gays, in particular, frequently require specialized medical treatment. In truth specialized treatment for LGBT falls exclusively in two categories: HIV/AIDS care, and transgender procedures. Both areas are generally staffed by specialists, so it is unclear why any other kind of doctor would encounter either issue.

If a person wishes to undergo surgical transition, he or she would not go into a family doctor’s office and request it. He or she would seek out a doctor who specializes in the surgery. Logically, if a doctor has trained to perform sex-reassignment surgeries, he or she has no moral or ethical objections to them. Thus the likelihood of a trans person being denied transgender surgery based on a doctor’s conscientious objection is essentially zero.

The issue comes down to possibility and paranoia. What if a transgender person goes to his family doctor to request a referral to a surgeon, and his doctor refuses based on moral grounds? What if an HIV-positive gay man seeks medical treatment but is turned away because a doctor believes his lifestyle is sinful?

Ironically, demands LGBT people be provided any medical procedures they wish from any doctor rely on irrational thinking about hypothetical situations. It is simply unreasonable to expect any medically trained professional, anywhere in the country, to turn away a person seeking medical care for any reason, let alone for being LGBT. Further, since transgender treatments are highly specialized, it is equally unreasonable for a person interested in them to expect widely available access as well. This is a preference of the progressive Left that seeks to normalize transgenderism and believes all doctors should agree with them.

A Desire to Ban Dissenters from Medicine

In the same way, simply because LGBT advocacy groups believe transition should be easily obtainable, paid by insurance or taxpayers, and widely available, individuals do not have a right to demand any services from any doctor, just like they can’t go into an auto parts store and demand to be sold something that store does not carry.

So why is it necessary to specifically protect doctors who do not wish to perform these services for religious or personal reasons? If transgender activists were content to work with doctors who supported their identity and cosmetic preferences, there would be no issue. But because this group demands absolute, universal service from all medical providers under threat of legal action, protections suddenly become relevant and necessary.

There are no “anti-LGBT” medical practices, just as there is no “license to discriminate.” Medical professionals have no desire to turn away gay or transgender patients for routine medical issues. But many do have a profound opposition to participating in any action that may contribute to what they believe will harm the patient.

The American College of Pediatricians, for example, has stated concerns about stalling puberty or introducing cross-gender hormones in children. Michelle Cretella, M.D., president of the American College of Pediatricians stated, “Last summer, the federal government stated that it would not require Medicare and Medicaid to cover transition-affirming procedures for children or adults because medical experts at the Department of Health and Human Services found the risks were often too high, and the benefits too unclear.”

A Refusal to Accept Professional Disagreements

Transgender therapy was, at one time, entirely dependent on the personal preferences of the doctor involved. Often multiple psychiatric authorities were required to approve surgical options before a doctor would perform them. This process to ensure a person’s mental well-being with full understanding of their decision offends the LGBT movement. They wish for an individual to be recognized by whatever identity he or she presents, without question.

The concern is not about denying a service to an individual based on gender identity, it is an issue of requiring a medical professional to take an action and hold responsibility for something he deeply and morally opposes. What is required of a medical professional for a sex change can hold significant ethical and moral considerations. By threatening the universal requirement of providing specific, controversial services the Left directly threatens medical professionals’ freedom.

Often the necessary response to a progressive social crusade is aggressive constitutional protections for those most vulnerable to their attacks. We have always taken for granted that people will respect the choices of others and simply seek alternatives if necessary. Sadly, we can no longer rely on such open-minded tolerance. So, since one purpose of the federal government is to protect citizens’ constitutional rights, including religious and conscience rights, this seems a situation where that protection is needed.

How ThinkProgress’s Review Of Transgenderism Book Proves Its Points,"Ryan Anderson’s new book on America’s new “transgender moment,” “When Harry Became Sally,” is a comprehensive, analytical look at the arguments and data regarding transgender issues. Predictably, it has been targeted by the usual suspects, who seem to view any intellectual disagreement on these issues as a sign of hatred. On the contrary, the book makes an important contribution to the substantive discussion and models the kind of honest analysis that reasonable people of good will, on both sides, should welcome.

Unfortunately, it is easier for some to mischaracterize than to engage the issues. Zack Ford of ThinkProgress recently reviewed “When Harry Became Sally.” He purports to respond to its arguments and expose its logical flaws, highlighting “the many weaknesses and contradictions” in Anderson’s book. Instead he only reinforces many of the points he intends to dispute.

Ford accurately highlights many of the points of contention in the transgender debates, however. It is useful to consider them in turn.

‘The Compassion Myth’

Ford categorically rejects what he describes as Anderson’s “clai[m] to be motivated by compassion.” His proof? Anderson’s description of transgender teen activist Jazz Jennings as “a biological male.”

Regardless of one’s stance on the wisdom of recognizing a transgender individual’s internal sense of being male or female instead of his or her biological sex, describing someone’s biological status as a male or female is purely objective (i.e., the person either possesses both an X and a Y chromosome or does not). In fact, one of the transgender movement’s own slogans, “biology is not destiny,” implicitly acknowledges the reality of biological sex (even if it disputes its lifelong implications).

Anderson affirms the reality of biological sex and points out “biology is not bigotry.” This distinction cuts to the core of our controversies over the “transgender moment”: it is impossible to have a reasonable discussion about rights and responsibilities if we cannot even agree to name biological realities without resorting to fictions and euphemisms.

What De-Transitioning Means

Ford also reacts poorly to Anderson including stories of “de-transitioners,” people who regret their decisions to undergo medical or surgical transitions to the opposite sex and eventually return to living in accord with their biological sex. Anderson’s book brings much-needed attention to these stories, which much media have roundly ignored or dismissed.

Why? Because these real-life stories upend the narrative. Like many of his fellow activists, Ford would have Anderson focus only on the “real-life accounts of those who have benefited by transitioning,” rather than the “small handful of individuals” who de-transition. All “lived experiences” may be equal, but some are apparently more equal than others.

In an ironic twist (and presumably with a straight face), Ford uses one of Anderson’s points about the transgender phenomenon as a way to dismiss de-transitioners. He argues that the de-transitioned individuals profiled in “When Harry Became Sally” “may not have been transgender” to begin with, and instead “largely convinced themselves that the problems they were experiencing meant they were transgender.”

Ford points out that individuals who de-transition frequently were victims of childhood trauma, and posits that many could simply have been suffering from dissociative disorders instead of being “actually” transgender. In the space of a few paragraphs, Ford apparently forgot that he has branded Anderson a “bigot” for raising similar points.

Ford never addresses—perhaps because there is no logically consistent way to do so—why his reasoning should apply to individuals who regret their transition but not to those who have not de-transitioned or who plan to transition in the future. Indeed, studies have noted that the transgender population has significantly higher rates of childhood trauma than the rest of the population — the same experiences Ford uses to discredit those who have de-transitioned. According to Ford’s logic, childhood trauma is evidence of dissociative disorders for gender-dysphoric individuals who transition then de-transition, but not for gender-dysphoric individuals who transition but have not (or, in some cases, not yet) de-transitioned.

Here again, Ford perhaps unwittingly undermines his own defense of the idea that young children can “know” they are transgender, and thus should be encouraged to transition, first socially then potentially with puberty blockers and hormone therapies. If, as Ford acknowledges (and the research shows), there is a correlation between childhood trauma and dissociative disorders that may lead people to transition, the recent push to allow children as young as four to begin transitioning begins to look like medical malpractice.

Anderson makes these points, with careful explanations: the “four-stage course of treatment [social transition as early as four, puberty blockers as the child approaches puberty, cross-sex hormones at sixteen, and sex reassignment surgery at eighteen] is the current standard of care promoted by transgender activists. But the ages for each stage to commence are getting lower,” and there are currently no U.S. laws regulating ages at which treatment can be administered.

Omitted Research and the ‘Desistance Myth’

Ford’s final substantive criticism of Anderson’s work consists of a frontal attack on the book’s sources, studies, and data. One of his targets is the American College of Pediatricians, which he describes as “an anti-LGBT hate group” that “peddle[s] anti-LGBT junk science.”

He also takes umbrage with Anderson’s citations of Dr. Paul McHugh, who served as the chief psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins Hospital for more than 26 years. Ford criticizes McHugh’s work as non-peer reviewed—an apparent reference to a 2016 article McHugh wrote with a colleague in The New Atlantis that summarized other peer-reviewed studies. After a quick Google search, I was able to find a list of at least 125 peer-reviewed publications McHugh has authored.

Ford also criticizes Anderson’s decision to dedicate a chapter to transgender children, an editing decision that is self-evidently reasonable, given the many lawsuits parents of transgender schoolchildren have filed over the past few years and recent events like an LGBT clothing designer’s decision to feature a nine-year-old boy dressed in drag. Ford quarrels with Anderson’s references to studies that show that nearly 80 percent of children who exhibit gender dysphoria eventually grow out of it. Ford calls these findings “the desistance myth,” citing a previous article he wrote that claimed the studies “did not adequately distinguish transgender kids from those who simply violated gender norms.”

That article also claimed that “children as young as 18 months can articulate” gender-nonconforming behavior. How exactly one determines an 18-month-old’s internal sense of being male or female is unclear, nor is it clear how one would distinguish a “real” transgender toddler from one who might simply be exhibiting signs of the dissociative disorders Ford attributes to individuals who have de-transitioned.

“When Harry Became Sally” presents a step forward in how to have necessary discussions about rights and responsibilities in our society in an honest—if not always comfortable— manner. Ford’s refusal to engage the arguments it contains is a telling signal of its effectiveness.

Why Americans’ ‘Comfort Levels’ With LGBT People Dropped Last Year,"America’s comfort level with the LGBTQ population is declining, according to GLADD, one of the oldest and largest LGBTQ organizations. GLAAD reports a drop of 3 to 4 percent drop in people’s reported “comfort levels” with several scenarios, such as learning a family member is gay. “This year, the acceptance pendulum abruptly stopped and swung in the opposite direction,” the report states. “More non-LGBTQ adults responded that they were ‘very’ or ‘somewhat’ uncomfortable around LGBTQ people in select scenarios.”

The decline is paired with a significant increase in LGBTQ people reporting discrimination because of sexual orientation or gender identity,” the report continues. “This change can be seen as a dangerous repercussion in the tenor of discourse and experience over the last year. 2017 brought heightened rhetoric toward marginalized communities to the forefront of American culture.”

The survey incorporated 2,100 respondents over the age of 18 and has been in place for several years. The survey asks for their comfort level with scenarios such as, “learning my doctor is LGBT” and “learning a family member is LGBT.” From 2014, in which comfort levels were the lowest, to 2016 where they were the highest, the change fluctuates under a 4 percent difference.

For example, in 2014, 31 percent felt uncomfortable with their doctor being LGBT. In 2015 and 2016, that was 28 percent, and in 2017, it hit 31 percent. “Learning my child has a lesson on LGBT history in school” represented the least comfort level in all four years, staying steady at 37 percent discomfort in 2014, 2015 and 2017 and only dropping to 34 percent in 2016.

If we put the shift in context, it appears the LGBT focus on transgender advocacy may have an impact on how average Americans view LGBT as a whole. Of U.S. Christians, for example, 63 percent believe sex is determined at birth rather than dissected between a changeable gender and ‘assigned’ sex. Of the same group, however, 54 percent believe homosexuality should be accepted. Roughly half of Americans believe sex is determined at birth at 54 percent, while 62 percent support same-sex marriage. It is clear that even in traditionally unfavorable populations, gay people are more easily accepted.

It is not difficult to understand why. Reasonably, before 2015, when transgender activists began demanding access to sex-segregated private spaces based solely on how they identify, transgender issues seemed largely resolved. Transgender reassignment surgeries were occurring in the mid to late 1950s, with Christine Jorgensen becoming a celebrity in the United States in 1959.

The first case that found post-operative transgender individuals could legally marry as the opposite gender was ruled in 1976. Most states have a process for recognizing a new legal gender and are willing to update the birth certificate. By the late 2000’s and into the second decade of the century, many major businesses were offering health insurance coverage of sex reassignment surgery.

But the media cycle began fixating on the idea of transgender bathroom access around 2015, and relentlessly pursued every conceivable social comfort and safety concern associated with access. From high school locker rooms to public restrooms and gym changing areas, America watched aggressive transgender activists impose new policies and regulations, and win lawsuits.

With fears of non-transgender predators taking advantage of the new policies, many states began implementing laws requiring a person to use the bathroom of their sex at birth. During that time as the rhetoric and demands rose, conversation among many on the right turned to concerns about women and children’s safety.

Shortly after, the news cycle moved on to children and gendered clothing, toys and costumes. Starting in 2015, Target led the way by announcing an end to gender-specific signage throughout the store. Disney stores followed announcing an end to “boys” and “girls” costume and toy labels. By 2017, we saw drag queens and other gender-nonconforming “educators” presenting gender identity classes to elementary school children.

January 2017 also saw the cover of National Geographic with a young boy dressed in pink with the title “Gender Revolution.” The series featured multiple 8-year-old boys and girls cross-dressing and identifying as the other gender. Jazz Jennings, a male child who became the star of a TLC program titled “I Am Jazz,” was followed through his transition, chemical puberty blockers, and social struggles.

We have witnessed an 8-year-old drag queen celebrated by LGBT media and culture and featured as the “covergirl” of an adult gay men’s erotic clothing shop. We have seen a sharp spike in child referrals in Europe for transgender treatment options. Parents are growing more aware that their ability to intervene in their child’s gender identity decisions made at school can lead to shaming and accusations of child abuse.

When a teenage boy who referred to himself as Leelah committed suicide at age 17 by running into traffic after his parents asked him to wait another year before beginning transition, LGBT advocates accused them of murdering their son. Writing for ThinkProgress, LGBT activist Zack Ford wrote, “I learned about Leelah’s death while traveling and expressed my grief on Twitter as such: ‘Rejecting the reality of LGBT identities is a form of genocide, an attempt to erase whole communities. Unfortunately, sometimes it works.’”

While many do not care if adults transition, the concern surrounding the consequences of transitioning children is growing. Very recently it was reported that Jazz Jennings is suffering from a profound consequence of hormone therapy. Jennings was placed on puberty blockers and now, as a 17-year-old, has prep-pubescent genitalia. As a result, Jennings is unable to go through “confirmation surgery” to form Jennings’ penis into a vagina. Jennings is likely to be infertile and unable to function as a sexual adult in the future. We have also watched as trans activists shame teenage and adult straight men for not wishing to date them or engage in sex with them.

Gay Americans have also contributed to many social concerns. Shortly after the Supreme Court decided that states could no longer limit marriage to one man and one woman, gay activists began demanding wedding cake bakers, caterers and photographers participate in their services. With highly publicized court cases in which small business owners found themselves losing everything they worked for with hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines, gay activists took on the role of bully rather than victim.

HIV activists too created uncertainty by demanding an end to HIV disclosure laws and limitations on blood donations. The LGBT media recently and widely celebrated a movie featuring a gay adult man sexually seducing a teenage boy titled, “Call Me by Your Name.” The movie is up for several Oscars in 2018.

Many people have watched the LGBT community and feel they are growing ever more hostile and bigoted towards them without just cause. In the survey itself it was reported that 55 percent of LGBT experienced discrimination as opposed to 44 percent a year before. A Center for American Progress report declared 1 in 4 LGBT Americans face discrimination. Most people don’t see examples of this in their daily lives, and yet average people are being increasingly accused of perpetrating oppression.

The left has a strange sense of entitlement to not only acceptance from the larger society, but also a universal embrace of their ideology. It is not enough to hold legal and civil equality — society must celebrate them as well. As a result, their rhetoric and activism become ever more petty and vindictive and naturally, the majority they accuse becomes more resentful.

Although a movement of a few percentage points is not indicative of a wide-sweeping change in public opinion, the reaction to it demonstrates something important. The LGBT movement is deeply reliant on social acceptance and approval and wishes to micromanage how we perceive them. But their efforts to coerce, impose and enforce radical policy and ideas onto the culture appear to be resulting in the exact opposite of what they wish to achieve.

Americans grew to accept gay people and even gay marriage through friendships, normalcy and time. They never cared about the personal choices of transgender people. Most simply do not care what adults do in private. But the more the LGBT movement imposes their demands on the daily lives of average people with threats of losing their livelihood and reputation if offended, the less acceptance they are likely to find. This is especially true when their ideas directly threaten the safety of children or vulnerable populations.

The Reported Spike In Anti-LGBT Homicides Is Fake News,"LGBT media outlets are implying the Trump administration is responsible for reports that the LGBT homicide rate doubled from 2016 to 2017. The media reports are citing an 86 percent increase in homicides, indicating a disturbing and sudden rise in violence. The details are laid out in a report from the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs titled, “A crisis of hate a report on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and Queer Hate Violence Homicides in 2017.” But a closer look at those details, as is often the case, reveals some problems with the conclusion drawn in the headline.

In 2016 there were 28 murders of LGBT Americans. This increased to 52 murders in 2017. Remarkably, the 2016 Pulse Night Club Islamic terrorist attack, always referred to as a “shooting,” in which 49 members of the LGBT community were intentionally targeted and murdered, is not included in these statistics. The context of the murders, however, suggest most of them were not necessarily motivated by the victim’s sexual orientation.

“We are releasing this report during a time when our communities are witnessing the few civil rights protections and policies being rolled back and discrimination being instituted into law,” the report begins, “when media organizations and organizations working with survivors are receiving an unprecedented number of stories of hate fueled attacks.”

The murders are referred to as “hate violence” and “anti-LGBT homicides” throughout the report, which helpfully includes a comprehensive list of all the murder victims and a brief description of the details surrounding their deaths. Each individual has multiple news reports associated with their murder, including the original local report as well as larger media pieces. Although many lack sufficient information to determine a motive, a majority provide enough details to understand some of the context surrounding the murders.

There were 27 transgender victims included in the report. The LGBT media tends to give a special spotlight for transgender murder victims in yearly collections meant to persuade the reader of a unique threat to this community. But according to the report, roughly 15 of the 27 crimes against transgender people have no suspect, motive or resolution. A victim is simply discovered in an ally or a street with no indication of what occurred. Fewer than half of all violent crime and property crimes (burglary or theft) are solved in the United States. Without sufficient evidence, the police are simply unable to make any clear determinations.

Of the remaining transgender victims, three were killed during police altercations. In all of those scenarios, the transgender individual was behaving erratically and aggressively towards police officers with a weapon. Of the others with murder charges associated, none were apparently motivated by the victim’s gender identity. Most of the crimes against transgender people appear to be random acts of violence, associated with sex work, or altercations between people who knew each other. One 17-year-old victim was killed by a romantic partner and their friends.

The next largest grouping of murders in the report relates to gay hook-up websites or apps. The report cites 45 percent of the known homicides of gay men were the result of online hook-ups. This scenario reflects the gay male community’s long-held fear of violence during anonymous sexual encounters going back to movies like “Cruising” (1980) and the death of Hollywood icon, Sal Mineo. “Cruising” featured a gay serial killer who targets gay men in known areas where gay men “cruise” for anonymous sex. Mineo was murdered in 1976 during a sexual encounter that turned violent in a cruising spot in Hollywood.

In 2016 there were several examples of gay men being lured to their deaths by men attempting to rob them or intentionally kill them. An Idaho man lured a gay man into the woods with the promise of sex before beating him to death, and four Texas men lured multiple gay men into robberies. One was sentenced to 15 years in prison. In another disturbing trend, as detailed in Vice in an article titled, “I Tried to Score as Much Free Stuff as I Could Using Grindr,” young gay men attempt to manipulate older gay men with the promise of sex for gifts. The article discusses three writers intentionally trying to scam people on hook up apps for fun.

Sadly, many young gay men listed in the report were last known to have met someone online and were later found murdered. The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs rationalizes this by stating, “Furthermore, there are ways that stigma, shame, and societal pressure may be contributing factors in hook up homicides where both individuals are queer, bi, or gay men.” In other words, it is well known that many gay male homicides are committed by other gay men. One victim was a lesbian murdered by a lesbian woman she met online.

Many on the list were killed by people they knew personally or in domestic violence. Roughly 11 of the 52 murders were committed by individuals the victim knew personally. Domestic violence is astonishingly high in the LGBT community. In 2010 the CDC reported that 43.8 percent of lesbians, 61.1 percent of bisexual women, 26 percent of gay men, and 37.3 percent of bisexual men experienced sexual assault, stalking or other physical violence from intimate partners. While it’s possible the murders committed by people the victim knew personally were motivated by a hate for their sexual orientation or gender identity, it’s much less likely, particularly in the case of loved ones and romantic partners.

After reviewing each of the 52 cases individually, it seems there are four pretty definite cases of anti-LGBT motivated homicides. Giovanni Melton, 14, was shot by his father during an altercation. The father, a convicted felon on previous battery charges, was vocally opposed to the young man’s sexual orientation. Rap icon, Kidd Creole, was charged with the murder of a homeless man when he stabbed him after interpreting the man’s greeting as a sexual invitation. He was walking with a large steak knife up his sleeve when he encountered the man.

Brandon Alexander Lyons and Jerrett Jamal Allen have been charged with the murder of one gay man and the possible abduction of another missing man. Both men were Asian, and the police believe the two men were targeting Asian men specifically. The two men themselves are Black. The dating app used was not specified so the homophobic motivation is speculation.

Juan Javier Cruz, 22, a straight man, was fatally shot in an altercation outside a night club in Lake Worth, Florida. He was with a group of gay friends when Nelson Hernandez Mena, 48, reported as an Honduran national, confronted them. As detailed by The Advocate, “Juan and Pedro Cruz stood side-by-side when Hernandez Mena and four other men confronted them. One of the men in the other group said that in other nations, men like Pedro and his friends would get killed. Hernandez Mena then said, ‘In my country I kill them like rats,’ according to Pedro Cruz.”

One final example that stands out is the murder of two lesbian women and their children in a brutal and intentional home invasion and murder. Two suspects were arrested and one of the suspects knew the women. According to the police, the suspects tied up the family and brutally killed them to steal their TV and Xbox.

While each life is valuable, and the goal of our society should be to end violence, random or intentional, there’s simply not enough here to claim a dramatic rise in “anti-LGBT” hate crimes in the United States. Reports like these, titled “A Crisis of Hate” propagate fear and paranoia in a specific community for the sake of political goals. LGBT media and organizations are stretching the narrative extremely thin when reporting these events. The new standard seems to be that if a victim is gay or transgender, their murder must be “anti-LGBT” in nature.

It’s important to continue researching and challenging these claims, but no victim listed here is necessarily honored or avenged by the positioning their murder as a larger political act. No future victim is potentially protected by perpetuating an exaggerated narrative of homophobic hatred and violence. Data must be accurate and reports like this must present a true picture of events.

On closer examination it appears that 4 of the 52 cases in 2017 were possibly anti-LGBT driven, and yet the headlines will continue to shout an 86 percent increase in anti-LGBT hate crimes. The more the LGBT media manipulates the narrative to perpetuate politically convenient fear, the less average Americans will appreciate true violence towards the gay and transgender community. This unethical behavior in journalism and advocacy organizations only harms the people it is attempting to protect.

LGBT-Flavored Textbooks Illustrate Growing Politicization Of Curriculum,"Late last year, the California board of education ended a decades-long campaign to emphasize lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender historical figures in state social-studies textbooks, approving K-8 volumes that place identity politics of all kinds at the heart of teaching and learning.

California has had enormous influence on the nation’s history textbooks for decades because of its large education market, and single-interest groups have long flocked to Sacramento to try to gain favorable inclusion. The LGBT lobby has been notably assertive. At 1990 hearings, an early textbook activist waved a huge rainbow flag, shouting that Julius Caesar, Michelangelo, Alexander Hamilton, and Eleanor Roosevelt were all gay. Based on correspondence between George Washington and Marquis de Lafayette, he declared: “The father of our country may have been its first queen.”

Pressure in the state capital has persisted. In 2006, Sen. Sheila Kuehl of Santa Monica, the state’s first openly gay legislator, introduced a bill that would require textbooks to include LGBT contributions to state and national history. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed the bill, calling it redundant and unnecessary, citing previous anti-discrimination laws and state guidelines for recognized interest groups, including LGBT. Five years later, a second bill similarly required texts to highlight LGBT issues. Gov. Jerry Brown signed it into law.

“Most textbooks don’t include any historical information about the LGBT movement, which has great significance to both California and U.S. history,” argued Sen. Mark Leno of San Francisco, this law’s author. “Our collective silence on this issue perpetuates negative stereotypes of LGBT people and leads to increased bullying of young people” He added: “We are censoring the history lessons,” denying students “the facts of the struggle for equal rights.”

Leno is now the front-running candidate for mayor of San Francisco.

Highlighting Historical Figures for Their Sexuality

In 2016, when California officially added LGBT mandates to the state-approved curriculum, the San Francisco Chronicle called the event “a landmark move that puts the ongoing LGBT civil rights fight into the mainstream of public education.”

Publishers duly responded, as they have with previous state laws and guidelines. They created schoolbooks that, among many instructional tasks, select, recognize, and feature historical figures based on their sexuality. Outing historical figures, often based on thin speculation, is new to school-level history, and many historians and textbook editors are uneasy with the trend, but California authorities rejected non-conforming submissions.

Several Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (HMH) books didn’t meet California reviewers’ requests for explicit references. The publisher’s middle-school text failed to sexualize historical figures Emily Dickinson, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, and James Buchanan, for example. The HMH rejection is ironic since, in 1990, Houghton Mifflin gained what amounted to a state monopoly, creating textbooks to match California’s daring new content framework.

The “achievements of people who experience or express sexual desire for their own sex as well as those who do not conform to conventional gender norms are central to both United States history and culture,” the publisher argued. “However, HMH feels that the terms lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer are contemporary terms that may not map well on past lives and experiences.”

Not good enough, the state’s review commission responded: “The absence of specific labels regarding sexual orientation creates an adverse reflection because the identity of these individuals is not honored and demeans their contributions to history.”

Do Subjective Labels Matter, or Deeds of Significance?

McGraw-Hill reportedly agreed to most corrections the commission suggested. However, it challenged sexualizing some historical figures, as “they raise complex issues related to academic integrity, including factual verification, language and readability.”

In its first-grade volume, instead of referring to Ellen DeGeneres as “a lesbian and humanitarian,” which reviewers recommended, McGraw-Hill specified instead: “Ellen DeGeneres … works hard to help people. She and her wife want all citizens to be treated fairly and equally.” Its second-grade volume identified astronaut Sally Ride as living with a partner, since that’s how she described herself, not as a lesbian. McGraw-Hill said the commission “may require identifying individuals in a manner that does not reflect their self-identity.”

But arguing over labels misses the point. What in the world is a television personality like Ellen DeGeneres doing in a first-grade social-studies textbook?

If you ask, many educators will look at you funny. If you exclaim that these are little children, that lesbian is a complicated word for six-year-olds, or that age-inappropriate might be an understatement here, heads will shake. If you say that sexualizing historical figures like Emily Dickinson or Florence Nightingale marginalizes their achievements, they will think you are the problem to overcome.

LGBT awareness is one of several themes reconfiguring K-12 history programs. California mandates study of “Native Americans, African Americans, Mexican Americans, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, European Americans, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans, persons with disabilities, and members of other ethnic and cultural groups.”

State law prohibits the state board and the governing board of any school district from adopting textbooks or other instructional materials that contain any matter that “reflects adversely upon persons because of their race, sex, color, creed, handicap, national origin, or ancestry.” Only textbooks assembled according to diversity’s catechism need apply for state approval.

Not just in California but nationwide, curriculum supervisors at all levels, by law or partiality, won’t consider volumes unless they align to multicultural premises. Old-style textbooks have been taken out of print. As a result, teachers and parents find it almost impossible to avoid lessons saturated in identity politics.

"Despite The Hysteria, There’s No Proof Mike Pence Is Anti-LGBT","The LGBT Left keeps insisting Vice President Mike Pence is not only “anti-LGBT” but a direct danger to LGBT rights in America. This idea gained traction again when U.S. Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon announced he’d turn down the vice president’s invitation for a meeting due to Pence’s “anti-LGBT” views.

“You mean Mike Pence, the same Mike Pence that funded gay conversion therapy?” Rippon said. “I would absolutely not go out of my way to meet somebody who I felt has gone out of their way to not only show that they aren’t a friend of a gay person but that they think that they’re sick.” He concluded, “Mike Pence doesn’t stand for anything that I really believe in.”

Pink News, a major LGBT news organization, reported that openly gay Olympic athlete Gus Kenworthy lamented Pence’s presence at the Winter Olympics to Ellen DeGeneres.

“So many people have paved the way, but then to have someone leading the delegation that’s directly attacked the LGBT community, and [is part of] a cabinet in general that stands against us and has tried to do things to set us back—it just seems like a bad fit, and I feel like the Olympics is all about inclusion and people coming together, and it seems like it’s not really doing that,” Kenworthy said.

The same news source complained that Pence attacked Rippon in response. Pence’s Press Secretary said Rippon’s characterization of Pence “has no basis in fact. Despite these misinformed claims, the vice president will be enthusiastically supporting all the US athletes competing.” Pink News goes on to assert, “However, Pence’s support for anti-LGBT laws and gay cure therapy is a matter of public record.”

.@Adaripp I want you to know we are FOR YOU. Don’t let fake news distract you. I am proud of you and ALL OF OUR GREAT athletes and my only hope for you and all of #TeamUSA is to bring home the gold. Go get ‘em! — Vice President Mike Pence Archived (@VP45) February 8, 2018

Does Mike Pence Really Hate Gay People?

That Pence supports “gay cure therapy” has become a matter of tribal fact among LGBT Americans. The accusation originates from Pence’s 2000 run for Congress. His website then stated, “Congress should support the reauthorization of the Ryan White Care Act only after completion of an audit to ensure that federal dollars were no longer being given to organizations that celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus. Resources should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.”

Although LGBT activists have interpreted this as support for gay conversion therapy, there is no record of Pence ever supporting this practice. It is no small matter that “sexual behavior” and “sexuality” are distinct concepts. “Seeking to change their sexual behavior” in this context is far more likely to indicate a change in the actual behavior that contributes to the spread of HIV. Pence’s accusers just assume he’s referencing gay men, which he did not say.

All HIV/AIDS advocacy at the time emphasized that everyone engaging in unprotected sex was at risk for HIV infection. The Ryan White Care Act assisted all people with HIV who qualified for its financial assistance. As a Christian conservative, Pence’s preference for directing tax dollars towards organizations promoting sexual responsibility to reduce the spread of HIV is not particularly controversial.

Time magazine catalogued Pence’s various statements and positions on LGBT issues throughout the years. He opposed same-sex marriage in 2006, as did President Obama and Hillary Clinton, stating in part, “societal collapse was always brought about following an advent of the deterioration of marriage and family.”

Pence also stated, “And let me say emphatically that this debate today is not about discrimination. I believe that if someone chooses another life-style than I have chosen, that that is their right in a free society. But tolerance does not require that we permit our courts to redefine an institution upon which our society depends.” Here the LGBT lobby judges him for implying that being gay is a choice.

Pence Went Out of His Way to Create LGBT Preferences

Naturally the “anti-LGBT” laws Pence is accused of supporting have been religious freedom bills. In reality, Pence went out of his way to modify a religious freedom bill in 2015 as governor of Indiana to ensure no discrimination towards gay people. Many on the Right felt betrayed.

Politico reported an evangelical supporter lamenting, “Pence really destroyed his reputation among social conservatives in Indiana over his fecklessness on the religious freedom bill.” Under heavy pressure from LGBT groups, Pence chose to sign revisions to the law that did not allow religious individuals to cite their faith in lawsuits alleging discrimination against LGBT customers, and even provides preferential legal consideration to LGBT citizens while not offering the same to religious citizens.

In 2007 Pence opposed the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which gave legal privileges to LGBT people as employees. Speaking on the House floor he stated, “Now let me be clear, I do not condone discrimination against people for any reason whatsoever.” He went on to explain that he opposed the bill because it would essentially create a constitutional conflict with religious freedom.

Pence opposed repealing the Clinton-era “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy on LGBT people in the military because, he said, the military should not be used for social experiments. He also opposed President Obama’s directive on transgender bathrooms in 2016 stating, “Policies regarding the security and privacy of students in our schools should be in the hands of Hoosier parents and local schools, not bureaucrats in Washington, DC. The federal government has no business getting involved in issues of this nature. I am confident that parents, teachers and administrators will continue to resolve these matters without federal mandates and in a manner that reflects the common sense and compassion of our state.”

These Are Basic Limited-Government Positions

Essentially, it seems Pence’s politics in this regard revolves around limiting the influence of the federal government, limiting the courts from making law, protecting freedom of religion for all Americans, and opposing the use of federal funds for progressive policies. The Left, in general, has the annoying habit of viewing opposition to progressive identity politics as hostility or hatred towards the identity group they affect. In no way is it apparent Pence holds any animosity towards gay people. If he does, he certainly does not show it in public or allow it to influence his views on liberty for all Americans.

It seems absurd to assert a man so riddled with hatred for gay people would be interested in meeting an openly gay Olympic athlete.

GLAAD, one of the oldest and largest LGBT advocacy groups, catalogued a list of Pence’s “anti-LGBT” actions that includes the debunked claim the Centers for Disease Control was instructed to remove several sensitive words, including “transgender,” from its official documents. The list states absurd claims such as, “The Trump Administration signs the GOP tax bill, which targets low-income and LGBTQ communities, into law,” and “The Trump Administration leaves the LGBTQ community and people of color out of the official World AIDS Day Proclamation.”

Basically, it appears that the LGBT Left’s standard for “anti-LGBT” is either opposing their political agenda items or failing to embrace them enough.

Sadly, as is demonstrated with both athletes’ statements and the LGBT media’s celebration of them, truth and context matter very little to how they feel about Pence. Despite his moderate and uncontroversial views, and his open advocacy for freedom of expression and the proper use of legal processes, the LGBT Left is too dedicated to their hatred to be reasoned with. It has simply become part of their cultural language to declare Pence a “homophobe” who wishes to take LGBT rights away.

It seems absurd to assert a man so riddled with hatred for gay people would be interested in meeting an openly gay Olympic athlete. An athlete, coincidentally, too marinated in prejudice to take the time to get to know who Pence really is or what he actually believes.

Rippon's Obsession With His Sexuality Undermines His Achievements,"Adam Rippon, who has risen to a level most athletes never dream of and has performed on the world’s stage in an elite competition, has decided to turn what should be a proud moment for his country into a political statement about his sexual identity as a gay person.

Rippon, 28, is one of the first openly gay American men to compete in the Winter Olympics. He began ice skating at age 10, and publicly came out as gay when he was 25. He struggled with his sexual identity growing up, and has said he hasn’t found the world to be a welcoming place (although he did win the 2008 and 2009 World Junior Championships).

In a USA Today interview leading up to the 2018 Olympics, Rippon was asked for his opinion of Vice President Mike Pence, who is not exactly beloved by the gay community, because he is personally opposed to gay marriage.

“You mean Mike Pence, the same Mike Pence that funded gay conversion therapy?” Rippon told USA Today of his role leading the American delegation. “I’m not buying it.” Those comments set off a back and forth between himself and Pence, who reportedly extended an invitation to meet with Rippon at the games, and later tweeted out a message of support for him.

Rippon says he declined the meeting, and doubled down on his negative opinion of the Trump administration in follow up interviews. Pence, for his part, says the invitation was never extended.

“I personally don’t have anything to say to Mike Pence,” Rippon told ABC News of the reported invitation. “I’m very lucky because legislation that he’s pushed hasn’t affected my life at all.” He has also said he would boycott a U.S. Olympic team visit to the White House, because he doesn’t think someone like him would be “welcome there.”

“I have no desire to go to the White House,” he told The Daily Mail. “But I would like to do something to help my community.”

Rippon and many in the LGBT community seem to have accepted the idea that both Trump and Pence are anti-LGBT fanatics bent on intentionally harming gay people, though there is no real evidence to support this media-fueled caricature.

He acknowledges that he has not experienced anything negative because of the legislation Pence … never passed. Yet somehow seems to believe people were harmed by an unsuccessful legislative push.

Rippon is “speaking out” against Pence’s perceived views, but not any concrete measure or impact from them. He is not “lucky” that Pence’s hypothetical agenda never impacted him, because it never impacted anyone in a meaningful way. And his refusal to even talk to Pence is strange, given the opportunity it would give him to speak to a powerful man on behalf of the LGBT community. Instead, he’s using his voice on the world stage to build out the myth of Pence as a gay-hater.

It’s remarkable Rippon can be personally encouraged by the Vice President of the United States, and still believe he would be unwelcome at the White House. The Left has convinced members of the LGBT community that only people who fully support progressive LGBT policies can be friends of the gay community. Anyone who opposes any policy is presumed a hateful bigot. The tangible result of this is a profound and debilitating anxiety and sense of fear and paranoia that Rippon seems to have bought into. A man, praised by the world, the media and the White House is too uncomfortable with the possibility of feeling unwelcome to embrace his status as a celebrated United States Olympic athlete.

Rippon illustrates how identity politics reduces people to their most useful categories and convinces them they must collect together with their respective tribes for safety from oppression. His insistence that rejecting the White House equates to supporting the LGBT community demonstrates how deep this tribalism runs, and how it leaves no room for open-mindedness or outreach — only certainty and avoidance.

Adam Rippon is an LGBT icon and hero today. In a time when a gay man stands out as a world-wide inspiration, embraced by the whole of the media and encouraged by the most conservative voices in our society, we should be celebrating this. Instead we are reliving the same victim-mindset we have seen replayed for decades, as if nothing has changed.

His community is celebrating him, not for his talent or performance, but almost entirely for his resistance against the anti-progressive villain of the day. Rippon’s athletic accomplishments are getting swallowed up by his identity as the ‘gay athlete’ that shouted back at the anti-LGBT White House and bravely stood in defiance of their hate, rather than an athlete who has achieved his goals.

Had Rippon simply walked onto the world’s stage as himself without the impulse to explain, defend or preemptively strike, he might have found a country eager for his success. We all would have cheered him on and celebrated his achievement as an American, even if we disagree with him in some policy areas.

Unfortunately, he chose the path of the righteous liberal warrior. It is my hope that the next time around gay athletes will simply understand they are celebrated for their talent and focus less on their sexuality. All we care about is how they perform in their field and we prefer not to be lectured to on diversity and tolerance.

Identity politics only manufactures anxiety, a sense of otherness and paranoia of how “they” might see you. In our day and age, this worldview is simply no longer needed, productive or helpful to our society and we should reject it at every opportunity.

Trans Activists Get Real About Their Crazy Ideas On Media Phone Call,"Yesterday, under the guise of prohibiting discrimination against LGBT individuals, the American Civil Liberties Union held a conference call with a panel of “experts and activists” to preview upcoming state legislative and ballot measures. Over the course of the 30-minute update, the ACLU highlighted the main areas of concern from their perspective.

As Rose Saxe, the ACLU LGBT and HIV Project senior staff attorney explained, ACLU priorities include a number of bills seeking to expand religious exemptions, such as West Virginia and Iowa’s proposed Religious Freedom Restoration Act laws. Saxe also condemned the provisions put forth in Oklahoma, Colorado, and other states that would allow child-placement agencies to keep foster-care and adoption placement decisions consistent with the organization’s religious beliefs.

The bulk of the conference call, though, focused on what the ACLU branded anti-trans legislation. Chase Strangio, a LGBT & HIV Project staff attorney, explained that most of these “anti-trans” bills focus on protecting single-sex facilities. Strangio noted that in April residents in Anchorage, Alaska will vote on one such measure—Proposition 1—and in November, a state-wide ballot measure will be before Massachusetts voters.

The ACLU then welcomed Lillian Lennon, a field organizer for Fair Anchorage and an opponent of Proposition 1. Lennon framed the proposition to preserve sex-specific facilities as an attempt to “legalize discrimination against trans people.” However, Proposition 1, and other similar single-sex facility laws do not “legalize discrimination.”

Rather, this citizen-introduced initiative, if adopted, would do two things: First, the law would require government-owned or -operated “multiple occupancy” restrooms and changing rooms, such as locker rooms or showers, to be single-sex. A municipality could, however, offer unisex single-occupancy restrooms and changing rooms. Second, Proposition 1 would allow private businesses to decide whether to maintain single-sex changing rooms and restrooms. In 2015 the Anchorage Assembly outlawed this by mandating that public accommodations open restrooms and changing rooms to members of the opposite sex based on their professed gender identity.

Your Complaint Is with Nature, Not the State

Proposition 1 does not treat transgender individuals any differently than it does other individuals. Access to “multiple occupancy” facilities is determined by sex for all individuals, whether transgender or not. There is no discrimination. Lennon’s real complaint, disguised behind the false flag of “discrimination,” is that Proposition 1 would not treat him differently than it does other men by allowing him access to female-designated locker rooms and restrooms because he is transgender.

In discussing the Anchorage proposal, Lennon also inadvertently exposed the extremism underlying activists’ opposition to Proposition 1. He complained the law, if passed, would “redefining” sex as “immutable by birth.” Proposition 1 does define sex “as an individual’s ‘immutable biological condition of being male or female,’ as determined by ‘anatomy and genetics at the time of birth.’” But that is not a redefinition of sex. That is what sex is.

Additionally, Lennon let slip the validity of the law’s justifications: safety. While maintaining “this proposition would not increase safety, in fact it could quite possibly make people less safe,” not a minute later, Lennon argued that because he lives as a woman, putting him “in a men’s restroom would put [him] at a serious risk for harm.” That is exactly why women do not want men in their locker rooms and restrooms, whether the men claim to be women or not.

Residents will vote on Proposition 1 by mail, with ballots mailed out in less than a month. Returned ballots must be postmarked by April 3. While the impact of this vote will be limited to the municipality of Anchorage, the outcome will be telling: When given the choice, will the populace hold fast against a trans agenda that demands society affirm a falsehood, or have activists already succeeded in redefining sex so that the citizenry sees male as female?

"Who Are the Rich, White Men Institutionalizing Transgender Ideology?","As an environmental activist who was deplatformed from a speaking venue by transactivists, in 2013 I developed curiosity about the power of this group to force this development. A year later, when Time magazine announced a transgender tipping point on its cover, I had already begun to examine the money behind the transgender project.

I have watched as all-women’s safe spaces, universities, and sports opened their doors to any man who chose to identify as a woman. Whereas men who identify as transwomen are at the forefront of this project, women who identify as transmen seem silent and invisible. I was astonished that such a huge cultural change as the opening of sex-protected spaces was happening at such a meteoric pace and without consideration for women and girls’ safety, deliberation, or public debate.

Concurrent with these rapid changes, I witnessed an overhaul in the English language with new pronouns and a near-tyrannical assault on those who did not use them. Laws mandating new speech were passed. Laws overriding biological sex with the amorphous concept of gender identity are being instituted now. People who speak openly about these changes can find themselves, their families, and their livelihoods threatened.

These elements, along with media saturation of the issue, had me wondering: Is this really a civil rights issue for a tiny part of the population with body dysphoria, or is there a bigger agenda with moneyed interests that we are not seeing? This article can only begin to graze the surface of this question, but considering transgenderism has basically exploded in the middle of capitalism, which is notorious for subsuming social justice movements, there is value in beginning this examination.

Who Is Funding the Transgender Movement?

I found exceedingly rich, white men with enormous cultural influence are funding the transgender lobby and various transgender organizations. These include but are not limited to Jennifer Pritzker (a male who identifies as transgender); George Soros; Martine Rothblatt (a male who identifies as transgender and transhumanist); Tim Gill (a gay man); Drummond Pike; Warren and Peter Buffett; Jon Stryker (a gay man); Mark Bonham (a gay man); and Ric Weiland (a deceased gay man whose philanthropy is still LGBT-oriented). Most of these billionaires fund the transgender lobby and organizations through their own organizations, including corporations.

Separating transgender issues from LGBT infrastructure is not an easy task. All the wealthiest donors have been funding LGB institutions before they became LGBT-oriented, and only in some instances are monies earmarked specifically for transgender issues. Some of these billionaires fund the LGBT through their myriad companies, multiplying their contributions many times over in ways that are also difficult to track.

These funders often go through anonymous funding organizations such as Tides Foundation, founded and operated by Pike. Large corporations, philanthropists, and organizations can send enormous sums of money to the Tides Foundation, specify the direction the funds are to go, and have the funds get to their destination anonymously. Tides Foundation creates a legal firewall and tax shelter for foundations and funds political campaigns, often using legally dubious tactics.

These men and others, including pharmaceutical companies and the U.S. government, are sending millions of dollars to LGBT causes. Overall reported global spending on LGBT is now estimated at $424 million. From 2003-2013, reported funding for transgender issues increased more than eightfold, growing at threefold the increase of LGBTQ funding overall, which quadrupled from 2003 to 2012. This huge spike in funding happened at the same time transgenderism began gaining traction in American culture.

$424 million is a lot of money. Is it enough to change laws, uproot language and force new speech on the public, to censor, to create an atmosphere of threat for those who do not comply with gender identity ideology?

Transgenderism: A New Medical and Lifestyle Market

It seems obvious now to look at the money behind transgenderism. Many new markets have opened because of it. The first gender clinic for children opened in Boston in 2007. In the past ten years, more than 30 clinics for children with purported gender dysphoria have arisen in the United States alone, the largest serving 725 patients.

Over the past decade, there has been an explosion in transgender medical infrastructure across the United States and world to “treat” transgender people. In addition to gender clinics proliferating across the United States, hospital wings are being built for specialized surgeries, and many medical institutions are clamoring to get on board with the new developments.

Doctors are being trained in cadaver symposiums across the world in all manner of surgeries related to transgender individuals, including phalloplasty, vaginoplasty, facial feminization surgery, urethral procedures, and more. More and more American corporations are covering transgender surgeries, drugs, and other expenses. Endocrinologists seeking the fountain of youth in hormones for more than a generation, and the subsequent earnings for marketing those hormones, are still on a quest for gold.

Puberty blockers are another growing market. The plastic surgery arm of medicine is staged for an infusion of cash as well as organ transplants, especially womb transplants for men identifying as women who may want future pregnancies. These surgeries are already being practiced on animals and the first successful womb implant from a deceased female donor to another female has already been a success. Biogenetics is poised to be the investment of the future, says Rothblatt, who has headed a massive pharmaceutical corporation and is now heavily invested in biogenetics and transplants.

Transgenderism has certainly made its way into the American marketplace, so it seems important to consider the implications of this as we pass laws regarding transgender individuals’ and our civil liberties. Transgenderism sits square in the middle of the medical industrial complex, which is by some estimates even bigger than the military industrial complex.

With the medical infrastructure being built, doctors being trained for various surgeries, clinics opening at warp speed, and the media celebrating it, transgenderism is poised for growth. The LGB, a once-tiny group of people trying to love those of the same sex openly and be treated equally within society, has likely already been subsumed by capitalism and is now infiltrated by the medical industrial complex via transgenderism.

Who Works to Institutionalize Transgender Ideology?

Much more important than funds going directly to the LGBT lobby and organizations, only a fraction of which trickles down to assist people who identify as transgender, is the money invested by the men mentioned above, governments, and technology and pharmaceutical corporations to institutionalize and normalize transgenderism as a lifestyle choice. They are shaping the narrative about transgenderism and normalizing it within the culture using their funding methods.

This can hardly be a coincidence when the very thing absolutely essential to those transitioning are pharmaceuticals and technology.

This article will use the Pritzker family as a case study, both to reduce length and because they are emblematic of how this works. Those funding trans organizations and normalizing transgenderism are channeling funds in the same ways and invested in the same medical infrastructure. This can hardly be a coincidence when the very thing absolutely essential to those transitioning are pharmaceuticals and technology. It is also important to note that though the trans lobby has sewn itself to the LGB umbrella, LGB people as such are not lifelong medical patients.

The Pritzkers are an American family of philanthropic billionaires worth approximately $29 billion, whose fortune was gestated by Hyatt Hotels and nursing homes. They now have massive investments in the medical industrial complex.

Examining just a few of the Pritzkers in this article will give you some indication of their reach and influence as a family, especially as regards the transgender project and their relationship to the medical industrial complex. As you read, remember, transitioning individuals are medical patients for life and the Pritzker family are not an anomaly in their funding trajectory or investments in the medical-industrial complex.

Jennifer Pritzker

Once a family man and a decorated member of the armed forces, Jennifer Pritzker now identifies as transgender. He has made transgenderism a high note in philanthropic funding through his Tawani Foundation. He is one of the largest contributors to transgender causes and, with his family, an enormous influence in the rapid institutionalization of transgenderism.

Some of the organizations Jennifer owns and funds are especially noteworthy to examining the rapid induction of transgender ideology into medical, legal and educational institutions. Pritzker owns Squadron Capital, an acquisitions corporation, with a focus on medical technology, medical devices, and orthopedic implants, and the Tawani Foundation, a philanthropic organization with a grants focus on Gender & Human Sexuality.

Pritzker sits on the leadership council of the Program of Human Sexuality at the University of Minnesota, to which he also committed $6.5 million over the past decade. Among many other organizations and institutions Pritzker funds are Lurie Children’s Hospital, a medical center for gender non-conforming children, serving 400 children in Chicago; the Pritzker School of Medicine at the University of Chicago; a chair of transgender studies at the University of Victoria (the first of its kind); and the Mark S. Bonham Centre for Sexual Diversity Studies at the University of Toronto. He also funds the American Civil Liberties Union and his family funds Planned Parenthood, two significant organizations for institutionalizing female-erasing language and support for transgender causes. Planned Parenthood also recently decided to get into the transgender medical market.

Jennifer Pritzker funds strategically, as does his family, by giving to universities that become beholden to his ideology, whose students go on to spread gender ideology by writing pro-trans articles in medical journals and elsewhere. Jennifer’s uncle and aunt, John and Lisa Pritzker, gave $25 million to the University of California at San Francisco for a center of children’s psychiatry. Jennifer likewise funds hospitals and medical schools where the alumni go on to create transgender specialties and LGBT medical centers, even though lesbians, gays, and bisexuals don’t need specialized medical services.

Here are just several current activities of Pritzker-funded medical school alumni and recipients of Pritzker money.

Jennifer Pritzker has also helped normalize transgender individuals in the military with a $1.35 million grant to the Palm Center, a University of California, Santa Barbara-based LGBT think tank, to create research validating military transgenderism. He has also donated $25 million to Norwich University in Vermont, a military academy and the first school to launch a Naval Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program.

Pritzker’s funding is not confined to the United States, but reaches other countries via WPATH, in conferences for physicians studying transgender surgery and funding of international universities.

Penny Pritzker

Cousin to Jennifer Pritzker, Penny Pritzker served on President Obama’s Council for Jobs and Competitiveness and Economic Recovery Advisory Board. She was national co-chair of Obama for America 2012 and national finance chair of Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign. To say she was influential in getting president Obama elected would be an understatement.

To say she was influential in getting president Obama elected would be an understatement.

As Obama’s secretary of commerce, Penny Pritzker helped create the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals (NIIMBL), by facilitating an award of $70 million from the U.S. Department of Commerce, the first funding of its kind. Obama made transgenderism a pet issue of his administration, holding a meeting at the White House (the first ever) for transgenderism.

The administration quietly applied the power of the executive branch to make it easier for transgender people to alter their passports, get cross-sex treatment at Veteran’s Administration facilities, and access public school restrooms and sports programs based on gender identity. These are just a few of the transgender-specific policy shifts of Obama’s presidency.

Soros and Gill are two other major transgender movement funders who generated millions of dollars to get Obama elected, and Stryker was one of the top five contributors to Obama’s campaign. Under Obama and President George W. Bush, the federal government also funded the Tides Foundation $82.7 million, which in turn donated $47.2 million to LGBTQ issues over the last two decades.

Penny has funded the Harvard School of Public Health and, with her husband through their mutual foundation, The Pritzker Traubert Family Foundation, are funding early childhood initiatives as well as providing scholarships to Harvard University medical students. The Boston Children’s Hospital Gender Management Services wing physicians are all affiliated with Harvard Medical School. Penny Pritzker also sat on the board at Harvard, where student life offices teach students, many of whom go on to lead U.S. institutions, that “there are more than two sexes.”

J.B. Pritzker

Penny Pritzker’s brother, J.B. Pritzker, is an American venture capitalist, entrepreneur, philanthropist, and business owner. He is co-founder of the Pritzker Group, a private investment firm that invests in digital technology and medical companies, including Clinical Innovations, which has a global presence. Clinical Innovations is one of the largest medical device companies and in 2017 acquired Brenner Medical, another significant medical group offering innovative products in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.

We have to look at why this is framed as a civil rights issue when the main issues seem to be capital and social engineering.

J.B. provided seed funding for Matter, a startup incubator for medical technology based in Chicago. He also sits on the board of directors at his alma mater, Duke University, where they are making advances in cryopreserving women’s ovaries.

J.B. is running for governor of Illinois in 2018 and put $25 million into an Obama administration public-private initiative totaling $1 billion for early childhood education. J.B. and his wife, M.K. Pritzker, donated $100 million to Northwestern University School of Law, partly for scholarships and partly for the school’s “social justice” and childhood law work.

We have to look at why this is framed as a civil rights issue when the main issues seem to be capital and social engineering. There doesn’t seem to be a sphere of influence that is untouched by Pritzker money, from early childhood education and universities to law, medical institutions, the LGBT lobby and organizations, politics, and the military. If they were the only ones funding the institutionalization of transgender ideology they would still be fantastically influential, but they are joined by other exceedingly wealthy, influential white men, who also have ties to the pharmaceutical and medical industries.

Pharma and Tech Giants All-In for Transgender

Along with support by pharmaceutical giants such as Janssen Therapeutics, the health foundation of a Johnson and Johnson founder, Viiv, Pfizer, Abbott Laboratories, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, and Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, major technology corporations including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Intel, Dell, and IBM are also funding the transgender project. In February 2017, Apple, Microsoft, Google, IBM, Yelp, PayPal, and 53 other mostly tech corporations signed onto an amicus brief pushing the U.S. Supreme Court to prohibit schools from keeping private facilities for students designated according to sex.

As these corporations were pushing for transgender bathrooms, they were fighting President Trump’s travel ban and immigration policies. In reporting the incidents simultaneously, CNN News made the obvious connection between the corporations’ interest in the immigration ban and commerce, quoting a legal brief signed by the companies that said, “It is inflicting significant harm on American business, innovation and growth.” It made no such equivalent connection for the corporations’ interest in transgender rights. The obvious question would be: Why do they care? The obvious answer is: money.

It behooves us all to look at what the real investment is in prioritizing a lifetime of anti-body medical treatments for a miniscule part of the population.

Melding this manufactured medical issue with civil rights frame entails the continuance and growth of the problem. Transgenderism is framed as both a medical problem, for the gender dysphoria of children who need puberty blockers and are being groomed for a lifetime of medicalization, and as a brave and original lifestyle choice for adults. Martine Rothblatt suggests we are all transhuman, that changing our bodies by removing healthy tissue and organs and ingesting cross-sex hormones over the course of a lifetime can be likened to wearing make-up, dying our hair, or getting a tattoo. If we are all transhuman, expressing that could be a never-ending saga of body-related consumerism.

The massive medical and technological infrastructure expansion for a tiny (but growing) fraction of the population with gender dysphoria, along with the money being funneled to this project by those heavily invested in the medical and technology industries, seems to make sense only in the context of expanding markets for changing the human body. Trans activists are already clamoring for a change from “gender dysphoria” to “gender incongruence” in the next revision to the international register of mental diagnosis codes, the ICD-11. The push is on for insurance-paid hormones and surgeries for anyone who believes his or her body is in any way “incongruent” with his or her “gender identity.”

Bodily diversity appears to be the core issue, not gender dysphoria; that and unmooring people from their biology via language distortions, to normalize altering human biology. Institutionalizing transgender ideology does just this. This ideology is being promoted as a civil rights issue by wealthy, white, men with enormous influence who stand to personally benefit from their political activities.

It behooves us all to look at what the real investment is in prioritizing a lifetime of anti-body medical treatments for a miniscule part of the population, building an infrastructure for them, and institutionalizing the way we perceive ourselves as human beings, before being human becomes a quaint concept of the past.

Indiana Guts Informed Consent Bill On Trans Ideology In Public Schools,"Six months ago, parents throughout the country expressed outrage upon learning that a California school taught kindergarteners boys could become girls and girls could become boys. This school did so without notifying the children’s parents or allowing the parents to opt their children out of these transgender classroom discussions.

Earlier this year, the Indiana Senate took steps to prevent a similar scenario from playing out in the Hoosier state by passing Senate Bill 65. Passed by a 37-12 majority, Senate Bill 65 would have required schools to let parents inspect all instruction materials used for “instruction on human sexuality, including sexual activity, sexual orientation, and gender identity.” Additionally, the bill would have required schools to obtain signed parental consent before providing “a student with instruction on human sexuality, including sexual activity, sexual orientation, or gender identity.”

But yesterday the House Education Committee sold out parental rights to LBGT activists by gutting Senate Bill 65 before voting it out of committee 8-5. Monday’s vote came less than a week after the committee took testimony on the bill, hearing from speakers such as 17-year-old Sarah Russell. Russell, a high school senior, told the committee her speech class included instruction on gender-neutral pronouns that sought “to teach students that you can change your sex and that’s normal.” She added that her “parents were not informed of this material before [she] took the class and were shocked to see it in [her] textbook.”

Among others, Purdue University education professor Tara Johnson argued to the contrary. She said Senate Bill 65 “would silence opportunities to discuss the issues that lead to LGBTQ students being bullied.” Of course, Senate Bill 65 leaves intact any school anti-bullying measures, and transgender students would be equally protected from harassment from their peers.

The education committee adjourned last week without voting on the bill. Their delay provided the American Civil Liberties Union and other LGBT activists the opportunity to pressure committee members to eviscerate the parental rights the law sought to protect.

Their efforts succeeded: On Monday, the House committee amended the Senate version, deleting the requirement that schools provide parents access to instruction materials related to sexual activity, sexual orientation, and gender identity. The committee also removed the requirement that parents consent before their children receive “instruction” on gender identity.

What does that mean? Schools may teach children as young as age five that a boy can become a girl or a girl can become a boy. Teachers may tell students that they must refer to a transgender student as belonging to a false sex and using incorrect pronouns. In other words, it allows exactly what transpired in a California kindergarten in August.

As I explained at the time, parents in California, as well as most other states, have no ability to prevent this type of indoctrination in public schools because “gender identity” is not considered “sex education.” In fact, in opposing Senate Bill 65, the ACLU of Indiana used this point to argue that the law should be scrapped, tweeting, “[g]ender pronouns are not sex education. Learning how to treat transgender people with respectful language should not be controversial.”

What the ACLU calls “respect,” however, is a demand for science denial and heresy. The Indiana legislature had a chance to prevent the public-school system from steamrolling parents who refuse to submit to the latest idolatry. Unfortunately, the House Education Committee bowed to the god of political correctness when pressured by LGBT activists. It’s a repeat pattern in a supposedly socially and fiscally conservative state with a decade-long GOP majority that in 2015 famously capitulated to LGBT activists in reversing a religious freedom bill to strip potential legal protections from religious people while extending extra legal rights to LGBT people.

It’s time parents speak up and contact their legislators. Demand the tax-funded public education system provide transparency in education and protect parental rights. And do so now, before the Indiana House votes on the revised bill. For the children—and the truth.

LGBT Activists Cheer Court Ruling That Destroys Transgender Theory,"The Second Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects gay employees from discrimination. Title VII prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin, and religion. The ruling suggests that sexual attraction is covered under “sex” within the statute.

“A woman who is subject to an adverse employment action because she is attracted to women would have been treated differently if she had been a man who was attracted to women,” the court’s majority opinion stated. “We can therefore conclude that sexual orientation is a function of sex and, by extension, sexual orientation discrimination is a subset of sex discrimination,” the opinion added.

LGBT media is celebrating the ruling as a major victory the LGBT community, although the decision only covers Connecticut, New York, and Vermont. Vox writes:

“The decision has national implications. Currently, most states and the federal government do not explicitly prohibit anti-gay discrimination in the workplace. But if the courts agree that the Civil Rights Act already bans anti-gay discrimination, they could change the national landscape once and for all. … Someone can be fired from a job, evicted from a home, or kicked out of a business just because an employer, landlord, or business owner doesn’t approve of the person’s sexual orientation or gender identity.”

The LGBT advocates here appear to have painted themselves into a corner with this newest decision. If taken as the judge argues, the decision stating that a woman attracted to another woman would experience different treatment than if she were a man attracted to women, functions as an argument against transgender ideology.

The decision rests on a firm and universal understanding of both “woman” and “man” in order to interchange them within the scenario. It also assumes employers are cis-gendered, heterosexuals. The argument is that her sex is determining the discrimination. But logically, if gender is fluid, one can be non-binary, both genders simultaneously or if a person transitions to the other gender, these conditions radically change.

If the woman were a man, the argument assumes, she would face no discrimination. But what if she is transgender and identifies as a man? The argument requires a belief that the employer would be comfortable with her identifying as a man and dating a woman, but uncomfortable with her being a woman and dating another woman due to anti-gay bias. In truth, the transgender position is that she was always a man, or perhaps a man with a vagina. Her sexual orientation changes depending on her gender identity. If the woman is bisexual, then she is safe dating a man, but unsafe dating a woman in this scenario.

But her sex does not change. The situation is rather absurd. But that is the point. The ruling relies on an extreme hypothetical that only complicates matters when discussed in detail.

Innate sexual orientation eligible for federal protection as a class of person requires a firm definition of sex. Gender identity theory creates a paradox as a person cannot be born attracted to one gender if that gender is subjective. Transgender and gender identity theory override sexual orientation theory and this ruling, very firmly, affirms sexual orientation theory. It is unclear, if made national, how it will interfere with the growing demand for gender identity inclusion. LGBT advocacy and this particular court are trying far too hard to force reasoning where it simply does not fit in order to achieve a policy goal that is both unnecessary and introduces new legal conflicts.

Despite continuous demands from the Left that, as stated above, LGBT individuals could be discriminated against in a variety of situations, there is very little evidence LGBT people currently are being discriminated against by employers. Lambda Legal, the first legal organization dedicated to assisting gays and lesbians in court, currently has six open cases involving employment discrimination, with only one alleging anti-gay discrimination.

The case in question, Frost v. Hesperia Unified School District in California, involves a lesbian teacher who claims to have experienced continuous anti-LGBT hostility from her superiors. Her claim ranges from her principle once asking her if she had a partner to which she felt he displayed “discomfort with her sexual orientation,” to once overhearing another teacher comment that she didn’t “look like” a lesbian.

The complaint argues that the school also discriminated against the Gay Straight Alliance to which she assisted and eventually decided not to renew her contract as a teacher. Her concerns include the school not announcing the club’s activities over the intercom to overhearing students saying, “That’s so gay.” She alleges she was once told by her principle he believed she was “teaching homosexuality” or “something to that affect,” but provides no documentation.

Overall the legal organization lists 38 cases of employment discrimination going back to the early 1990’s, but roughly 8 of them directly claim employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or transgender identity. Assuming the current open case, with the last documented decision to strike much of the complaint in 2015, was completely true, by its nature it is a remarkable outlier.

As The Human Rights Committee reports on its website, 89 percent of Fortune 500 companies self-regulate against anti-LGBT discrimination. Despite 1 in 4 LGBT Americans reporting experiencing discrimination in 2016, there appears to be no legal action, evidence or substance to the claims. In fact, the study citing this number uses as one of its core examples a man who believed he was being unfairly left out of golfing invitations because he was gay, which he believed were necessary for career advancement.

There is simply no solid evidence to believe LGBT discrimination is an issue requiring state or Federal intervention or protection. Nevertheless, LGBT activists persist in their efforts to be included in anti-discrimination efforts. A primary reason I oppose much of the political agenda of the LGBT Left is due to the fact I do not want my rights and freedoms, or my very identity, determined by the federal government, of which I have very little influence. In this case, my status as a gay man is up for debate based on the changing political needs of the LGBT movement.

This ruling has the potential to open up a great deal of legal conflict and in its effort to force protections may create legal inequality in the process. It is also the beginning of a wave of demands for existing law to conform to ever-changing attitudes and views of sex, sexuality and gender identity. Despite the narrative, there is no purpose or positive benefit to enforcing this type of protection in the first place and it creates opportunities for abuses. It could lead to inadvertent discrimination against gender identity or sexual orientation depending on the circumstance.

It should be clear that this kind of legal manipulation by the courts as opposed to the voice of the people within a given state causes more problems than it solves. However, it seems equally as clear that the voice of people has already been spoken within the anti-discrimination policies of the majority of American corporations. We truly do not need anymore anti-discrimination laws and the more we attempt to fit in every conceivable identity or social option, the more absurd our legal system will become in practice.

The 'Call Me By Your Name' Celebration Is Astounding In The #MeToo Era,"In a year dominated by the conversation of sexual abuse in Hollywood and the fluid nature of teenage minors in adult roles, the celebration of the movie “Call Me by Your Name” at the 2018 Oscars, by the media and especially LGBT media, is astounding.

The controversy began in September of last year when James Woods commented on the film that it promoted pedophilia. The star of the film, Armie Hammer, shot back, citing Woods’ previous relationship which involved a significant age-gap. The conversation from then on argued that an “age-gap” in a same-sex love story was making people, specifically conservatives, uncomfortable. As is typical, there was far more depth to the concern.

The film is based on a book by the same title published in 2007 and set in the 1980s. Both the book and the film feature the main character, Elio, a 17-year-old, pursuing a college-aged man. The book is far more darkly obsessive and lustful than the film adaptation, which dedicates its time to the intense romantic nature of the relationship. Strangely, it is argued that because the younger boy pursues the older man there is no predatory behavior involved. To continue this line of reasoning, because Elio is described as mature and aggressive, it is argued he fully understands and consents to the relationship.

To start this conversation, we have to recognize a significant ideological perspective difference between the two sides of this argument. The Right tends to view law as recognizing morality whereas the Left views law as defining morality. As described in a surprisingly insightful Slate article titled, “What Should We Make of Call Me by Your Name’s Age-Gap Relationship?,” Hammer, like many others, dismissed criticism about the underage relationship in the film, citing various “age of consent” laws across the country and abroad. The movie is set in Italy which has an age of consent of 14 years old. This, I have been sternly lectured by dozens and dozens of people on Twitter, discredits any efforts to argue that the age difference matters.

The purpose of an age of consent law is to legally define at what point it is legal to engage sexually with a minor. This standard varies wildly between states and countries. The relationship depicted was not illegal within the setting of the film and many supporters feel that should be the end of the conversation. However, the core concern is not one of legality but one of morality and ethics. As stated, within the setting of the film, it is legally acceptable for an adult to engage sexually with a teenager as young as 14. It should be very well understood that in no way is this activity acceptable, moral or ethical.

The objection from the Right has never been about an “age-gap.” This implies that the concern is merely surrounding a separation of years between two consenting adults as being somehow socially unacceptable. However, the concern has nothing to do with a difference of 7 years. The issue is with an adult engaging in sexual activity with a teenage minor. Regardless of legality, it is wrong for an adult to make this choice and the behavior, interest or insistence of the minor is irrelevant. So is “love” in this context.

Sally Kohn demanded in a tweet response to my challenging her on celebration of the film stating, “@RealChalamet’s character was 17 and a few months shy of being able to legally buy a gun. So I’m curious, do you think he’s old enough for violence but too young for love?!”

The Left has found itself in a strange game of semantics between a teenager being a “kid” or “child” when advocating for gun control and “old enough” to pursue adult sexual relationships. The assertion that 16-year-olds should be allowed to vote but not own a firearm until age 21 is also confounding. But in this specific and selected scenario, the objection seems to be that a young gay man should be judged for chasing his romantic desires. In context to his sexuality, it is viewed as a beautiful, brave and exciting coming-of-age journey to finding himself. The romanticized narrative superimposed onto the situation overshadows all relevant concerns.

For LGBT advocates, this narrative is extremely important. The obsession with identity and diversity in all areas of life has created a relentless need in members of liberal identity groups for ever-increasing and publicly praised representation in film and media. A powerful love story between two young men, set in a time when such love is forbidden is irresistible to a sub-culture utterly fixated on reliving the anxiety and sexual fantasy of their youth.

The age of the young man is intentional. Had the author, in 2007 when LGBT acceptance and legal advancement was steadily growing, chosen to make the younger character 18 years old, the story would have been just as powerful without a single concern. But he chose 17 because it represents a major theme in LGBT social architecture. LGBT define themselves by their sense of rejection and isolation from family and society as teenagers and relish the fantasy of setting out on their own, rebelling against society’s limitations. The fact that the younger of the two pursues the relationship, under the nose of his father, in a forbidden way and in a forbidden time is powerful for this very reason. To challenge this as abuse is to significantly dismiss and shatter the fantasy they so deeply cherish.

The visual age-difference between the characters is also intentional. Armie Hammer is 31-years-old but looks much more mature. He is physically imposing and towers over Timothée Chalamet, who is 21 but looks extremely adolescent in the film. As the above Slate article notes, the physical differences and visual age differences are exaggerated throughout the film with Elio seated and Oliver standing tall above him. The promotion photos and stills from the movie that circulated the internet prior to its release closely resemble a visual picture of a very adult man seducing a very adolescent teenager. In many ways this too plays powerfully into the fantasy of an entire generation of gay men who lusted fruitlessly over older, masculine men in an age when they just nearly had the freedom and social option to pursue them. More darkly, as a gay man who has grown up in gay culture since the late 1990’s, the pornographic “father/son” imagery is impossible to ignore.

Most importantly the LGBT Left is desperately enraptured by the sheer level of praise and celebration the entire media and Hollywood industry has bestowed on the film. It has become a validation for them and thusly any criticism is sharply stamped out. Even if they were to recognize the inappropriateness of the relationship, they are too invested in what the movie is meant to represent to the whole of the LGBT community to willingly undermine it now. Sadly, the selective morality we too often witness from this political movement is extremely transparent here.

The movie won awards, has its own verified Twitter account, has dozens upon dozens of gushing headlines and tearful praise from media spanning the genre spectrum. The stars were featured on “Ellen” and there is a massive sub-culture of fans, both LGBT and straight, dedicated to the story in a way rarely seen for what would be otherwise a niche film. Liberal culture has spoken. But conservative culture has an obligation to speak louder.

The MeToo movement exposed a startling level of abuse against women and young men in the entertainment industry and through various gestures, both meaningful and hollow, of support for the victims. The Left, however, has a significant blind spot. When faced with the choice to stand up against the idea of glamorizing an adult-teen sexual relationship and promoting a break-through LGBT love story, they are incapable of making an ethical decision. They are equally incapable of recognizing the consequences.

This film has now entrenched in gay male culture and validated the idea that a teenage minor is not only entitled to his sexual impulses but should be celebrated for pursuing them at all costs. It positions the reluctant older man as demonstrating kindness and compassion to the intense desires of the younger man by giving into and indulging his impulses and manufactures a fantasy of true and powerful love resulting. It tells a generation of men in their 20’s and older that pursing sexual relationships with teenagers is not only beautiful and empowering to the younger partner, but perfectly acceptable as long as it is legal.

Conservatives should continue to call this “abuse.” Despite the very determined ignoring of our demands, we are not alone in our repulsion to this narrative. Jimmy Kimmel was widely prasied and quoted at the Oscars by saying, “We don’t make films like ‘Call Me By Your Name’ to make money. We make them to upset Mike Pence.”

The message is clear. The Left will support and celebrate adults engaging sexually with teenagers if they think it upsets everyday America with a narrative of defiant romanticized rebellion. Everyday America needs to pay attention and make sure they know we not only find it morally unacceptable but dangerously irresponsible and will continue to speak out against it.

My Fears Of Hate Over My Same-Sex Marriage Proved Unfounded,"I got married. I always wanted to get married. In high school we had to plan a full fantasy wedding and build a wedding album. I chose Freddie Prinze Jr. and we had a glorious Christmas-themed wedding complete with a Christmas tree wedding cake. I planned to complete this life event no later than age 25 and already had the colors, music and guest list sorted out. But there was a sadness to the whole thing, as in the back of my mind I knew it wouldn’t be real, or at least legally recognized. The idea of a ceremony without substance behind it felt hollow and defeating.

By the time I developed my conservative position on most topics, same-sex marriage was well on its way to becoming a legal standard in states across the country, mine included. I always supported gay marriage as a concept, but over time my interest grew more towards the method of implementation than the outcome itself. I argued then as I do now that marriage is a positive force and an answer to the many social concerns in the LGBT community. Financial security, legal recognition and ease of property transfer were and still are benefits to the institution. Regardless of the nature of opposition to gay marriage by conservatives, I never encountered anyone opposed to the adaptation of basic legal protections for same-sex couples, and that mattered more to me than the word “marriage” did.

But all of this was experienced in the abstract world of political discourse, and until I found myself fantasizing about what it might be like to actually be married to my boyfriend, it always felt distant from my reality. From flying to England to meet his family to driving several hours in the snow to meet my own, I discovered the humor and joy in the simple rituals of dating. My friends, coworkers and online companions in politics embraced us effortlessly, and no matter how many ridiculous and cliché couple selfies we took, there were plenty of likes and encouragement. I came to enjoy the nodding in understanding from more seasoned people in relationships and relished the day-to-day activity exclusive to a serious commitment. Marriage just seemed natural.

I have always been a private person when it came to dating. Holding on to old prejudices and fears surrounding how people might judge me kept me from really introducing romantic partners into my regular life. Before social media this was much easier to accomplish, and my family never met anyone I considered seriously until now. My anxiety, driven by years of media warning me of rejection and isolation, kept my happiness in the exclusive world of other gay people and very close friends. I just never felt safe holding hands in public or sharing my life beyond the tight control I insisted on holding.

But that changed. Over time I discovered that acceptance tends to come slowly but steadily as people see your life unfold in real time. Every picture I posted, every inside joke and casual reference, every innocent, unguarded moment of affection in public opened up my realization that everything I grew up hearing was simply wrong. Online, my friends embraced us with such affection it surprised me a little. I honestly did not expect people to be so happy for us. Across the spectrum in my personal life and through political Twitter people openly and warmly celebrated with us as our relationship grew. If anyone held any opposition to our relationship for religious or socially conservative reasons, they certainly never mentioned it.

In my day-to-day life, coworkers, friends and acquaintances from long ago all dedicated moments of their time to making sure he and I felt loved and appreciated. Both of our families embraced us individually without hesitation as well. Mine in particular took a great deal of pleasure in welcoming us into the family, insisting on referring to him as a new son. My nephews and nieces embraced him and called him “uncle Jacob” without a moment’s pause. The comfort level and support admittedly felt strange to my perspective that always anticipated polite hostility and cool tolerance. It turns out the fantasy scenarios I had played in my head for all these years surrounding just about everybody existed exclusively there.

In the regular world, our coupling seemed so profoundly mundane as to be absurd in context to what one reads in LGBT media on a daily basis. Stores, restaurants, and random passersby never seemed to blink twice at seeing he and I hugging, leaning close in to each other or sharing a private laugh or quick kiss. Visiting a theme park, the zoo, an aquarium and even getting our portrait drawn just felt, well, normal. I found myself forgetting that I was “different” and falling into comfortable relaxation with the man I was quickly falling in love with. Without awareness of what others around me might be thinking, all that mattered was that moment with him.

The day of the wedding was certainly different than I imagined as a teenager. We decided to go with a simple service outside with just my family. Setting up the details with courthouse clerks and scheduling an officiant felt similar to renting a car. No one hesitated when I used the word “boyfriend” or a male name after “fiancé.” The marriage license process was enjoyable, and like most interactions with the government, fairly tedious. We chatted and gave our information and paperwork and the clerk didn’t seem to notice we were both men. The straight couple right before us had the exact same experience. It was, to be as clear as possible, perfectly equal.

But I had an interesting realization throughout the process. Despite literally everyone’s best intentions and efforts, with kindness and openness throughout, it was pretty obvious we were breaking new ground. There is no good way to describe two men in a marriage together. Are we each other’s “husbands?” Are we “partners?” I despise the phrase “significant other.” Right before we said our vows, the officiant asked us for our preference, and I recognized that the whole thing was slightly silly. We were clearly taking something that did not belong to us and making it our own. Neither good nor bad, just honest.

While the attitude has been a sense of entitled outrage from the LGBT community towards this topic, I find myself far more grateful to a tolerant society offering me and my husband the opportunity to join in on something beautiful and meaningful. As a citizen I think it is perfectly reasonable to expect legal equality and certain legal securities and benefits afforded exclusively to married couples were perfectly fine to seek out. Today I have the ability to combine his and my life together in a way that brings us both assurance and comfort. But it really is the goodwill and acceptance of everyone else around us that we are so enthusiastically welcomed into the institution itself, despite the method in which it was imposed legally.

No one there acted against their will. We were not asserting legal entitlement or demanding something from a person morally opposed to the act. I specifically asked the officiant if she felt comfortable marrying us, as I did not want her to feel obligated to do so out of concern for an accusation of discrimination. While legally obligated to do so, she was perfectly open and genuinely excited to participate. Outside of the framework of natural equality, open tolerance and societal libertarianism, I may never have had this opportunity to join my life to a person of my choosing. I think that matters a great deal.

In my journey I firmly believe that acceptance comes naturally through daily interaction and witnessing the genuine, human experiences of others. No one in my life was forced to embrace me. They all chose to because they love me. I can honestly say that neither I nor my husband have experienced anything coming close to hostility, discrimination or intolerance in our everyday lives. I don’t think this is a result of legal demands or imposed social change. I just think most people are simply happy that we are happy and really, that’s all that should matter. When people are allowed to express kindness without coercion, it comes effortlessly.

I share this because we far too often hear nothing but the extreme and negative from LGBT media. Certainly not everyone will have the same accepting experience we have had. But it bears witness to the reality that most people are kind, generous, accepting and genuinely pleased to see other people happy. We have to remember that the good outweighs any bad that may exist, and, as gay people integrate further into normalcy and the mundane, we must remember that we were first welcomed here by people who love us. We don’t have a right to demand space, but we are fortunate to be surrounded by people who offer it to us anyway. I am grateful to everyone who welcomed us into their lives and gave us such open and genuine friendship and encouragement. Thank you for being so happy for us. I think this truly represents America and I am lucky to live in a country where my natural liberty and freedom are not only understood but defended and celebrated.

Should DoD Bend Over Backwards To Support Trans Military Personnel?,"Any day now the Trump administration is expected to announce its policy on transgendered people serving in the military.

Can you imagine writing or reading that sentence twenty years ago?

On the morning of D-Day, Franklin Roosevelt asked the nation to join him in prayer for “our sons, pride of our nation” who had set upon a mighty endeavor, “a struggle to preserve our Republic, our religion, and our civilization.”

That very civilization, which successfully repulsed the onslaught of the Boche, is under attack from top people in the American government. The Supreme Court has held, not just that prohibiting marriage between people of the same sex is unconstitutional, but that those who oppose the concept are bigots. Sen. Bernie Sanders (honeymoon spot: Soviet Union) thought Russell Vought was unfit to be deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget because of his Christian belief that salvation is found through Jesus Christ alone. Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA) attacked Amy Barrett, a Trump nominee for the Court of Appeals who is a Catholic and a mother of seven, saying, “The dogma lives loudly in you, and that’s of concern.”

A Policy For A Small Fraction Of The Population

Is this a real concern or a media-created issue? How many transgender people really want to join the army? And, perhaps most important, do young people care? It is they, after all, who will have to share their foxholes. If they don’t care, should we?

Perhaps. They may say they don’t care. But what if military experience shows otherwise; shows that, when the incoming starts … coming in, the men in the foxholes care desperately?

And how many transgender people are there anyway? One estimate is that there is about one transgendered person in every 250 adults in the country. About 180,000 people join the military each year, which means there may be as many as 720 transgender people in that group. That is not a large number and the administration may simply not want to take on the fight that would be required to keep them out.

Why do they want to join the military? One reason may be to have the government pay for their transgender surgery, the average cost of which is said to be at least $130,000.

Question: Why should taxpayers have to pay for that? Answer: They shouldn’t.

What the administration may decide to do is allow transgendered people into the military, provided they have already completed the transgender process, from soup to nuts, a process that could be administratively determined to be eighteen months. That will keep people from joining until they’ve settled into otherhood.

It’s a reasonable guess that such a policy will discourage at least some, and perhaps many, transgendered people from trying to join the military. But will such a policy satisfy the LGBTQ political lobby and their frenetic — and Trump Resistance — allies, all of whom are probably less interested in gender travel than in trashing Western Civilization and the Trump administration while they’re at it.

And who will make the decision? President Trump or Secretary of Defense James Mattis? It’s not clear that the administration has the fortitude to take on the LGBTQ lobby. When the administration, at the urging of Secretary Mattis, nominated Mark Green, a former state senator of Tennessee and a physician who once served alongside Army Special Operations troops, to be secretary of the army, the LGBTQ lobby went berserk. Green has suggested that being transgendered is a disease. That shouldn’t have been so shocking. It’s binary: Wanting to switch genders either is a disease or it isn’t. Green’s opinion probably reflects that of most Americans. Probably most doctors too.

Another question is how much influence Anthony Kurta will have on the decision. Kurta, an Obama holdover, has been nominated to be deputy under secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, the office that is tasked, under a memo of Obama Defense Secretary Ash Carter, with creating, managing, and overseeing policies regarding transgender issues.

Last June, Kurta proclaimed that the US military would celebrate June as LGBT “pride” month (are Qs the new MIAs?) and he was a key speaker at the Pentagon’s gay pride celebration — a speech probably not written by Phyllis Schlafly.

The question for the Trump administration is whether it needs to go to war with the LBGTQ lobby right now. Mark Green concluded it did not, or would not — or perhaps it was concluded for him — and withdrew his name from consideration, which means Green is out and Kurta is in: not the optimal situation for Western Civ.

Trump has a fair wind and following seas at the moment (tax cuts, deregulation, declining unemployment, Korea,) though there may be stormy weather ahead, but he may simply not care, or not care enough, about keeping a few oddballs out of the military — and yes, Virginia, one out of 250 is odd.

Probably, ordinary people, ordinary conservatives, can live with letting the oddballs in, so long as the taxpayers don’t have to pay the cost of their surgeries and consequent adaptations. Any policy more generous than that may produce blood in the streets in defense of Western Civ. But then, that’s what blood is for.

Asking Census-Takers If They're LGBT Reinforces Separate And Unequal,"Many people in the media, including multiple left-wing celebrities, reacted in outrage on March 29 that the 2020 Census would not include LGBT individuals.

Sarah Silverman declared: “This is real handmade[s] tale shit. Unacceptable. I need to punch a pillow in the fucking face right now. Ok what do we do” in response to Alyssa Milano’s tweet, “This is infuriating and un-American.” Kathy Griffin too tweeted out in outrage only to delete the tweet shortly after. The story that caused this firestorm was from NBC News titled, “LGBTQ Americans Won’t Be Counted in 2020 U.S. Census After All,” but it was published March 29th 2017. As NPR reported on the same date of this year, couples living together will be asked if they are same or opposite-sex married or unmarried partners.

This does not appear to have calmed the outrage, however. Meghan Maury, policy director at the National LGBTQ Task Force argued, “The Census controls billions of dollars in federal funding, determines our representation at the state and federal levels, and impacts scores of other programs like how our school districts are drawn.” She further said, “The Trump administration appears to be hellbent on erasing LGBTQ people, but the reality is we are a significant part of the population. We’re here, we’re queer, we’re not going anywhere. We deserve to be counted in the Census.”

The focus seems to be on the idea the Census will not specifically ask individuals if they belong to the ever-growing categories typically under the umbrella of “LGBT.” An example of this concern is expressed by Ronald Lewis, a single gay man quoted by NPR: “If this is about how resources are spent or given to communities and we are talking about the LGBTQ community, not everyone is married or in a relationship.” The article argues that the lack of an LGBT specific identity question means, “there are no reliable national data about how many LGBT people live in the U.S. that can inform public policy.”

After adding a pink sticker with questions about her own gender identity to the 2010 Census form, Cecilia Chung, a senior director at the Transgender Law Center, who is a transgender woman said, “You know, these are all labels … But if we don’t have the proper labels when we try to look at the picture, there will be a lot of missing pieces, like jigsaw puzzles.” In 2020, she adds, “even with same-sex couples recognized on the census, there’ll be a lot of other people in the LGBT community missing from the picture of America.”

The question that arises from my point of view is why sexual or gender identity needs to be collected in the first place. The argument is that data is required for appropriate funding and resources for LGBT Americans, but that begs an additional question as to why LGBT-specific government programs are required as well. There are no special circumstances within the range of federally funded government programs that would be different for a gay or transgender person. There is no need for segregated services, housing, shelters, education or other government welfare assistance programs either. In short, there is no real reason LGBT should feel they need the government to care for them individually.

In truth, LGBT programs and studies are outdated and rely on strict definitions and assumed social circumstances that are unverifiable and unsustainable. Unlike other characteristics, sexual orientation and gender identity are self-defined and self-reported. There is no consistency in how “gender identity” is defined at all, let alone in a category useful for data collection.

While I challenge the idea that it is necessary to know how many same-sex couples, married or otherwise, there are in the country, it makes absolutely no sense to count the number of single individuals who identify as gay. Certainly, if LGBT are “erased” by not being specifically identified, so are straight or cis people who also lack an opportunity to express their sexual orientation or gender identity.

I find it strange that a movement that has dedicated itself to the concept of “equality” for so many years is advocating for segregation on what should be a very simple count of the American population. I am a gay married man, but when filling out forms I simply select “married.” For years I selected “single” as well.

There is no reason to include the fact that I am gay, or my spouse is a man. Under legal or social equality, it shouldn’t matter anymore than I am Jewish, and he is Atheist. It seems ridiculous that I have to designate that I am in a same-sex marriage and directly implies my marriage must be different than an opposite-sex marriage, otherwise no distinction would be needed.

The core of this concern, in my view, revolves around the reality that the LGBT Left has constructed its entire system of civil rights and validation on the foundation of ever-changing political sands. By their insistence on referring absolutely every aspect of LGBT life to a governmental authority, they have made themselves vulnerable to the whims of a temperamental government. For them, the smallest change in political balance threatens everything they have worked so hard to put into place. Do they really want to be counted by a government they firmly believe wishes to intentionally deny them their civil rights?

A primary reason I oppose much of the political agenda of the LGBT Left is due to the fact I do not want my rights and freedoms determined by the federal government, of which I have very little influence. The federal government can impose sweeping benefits, regulations and protections and can repeal them just as easily. I, as a citizen, am much better off focusing my political efforts on my local and state governments which move more slowly and can be more easily manipulated by public voice.

This illustrates a major flaw in LGBT thinking, in which rights, protections and benefits are defined separately from the majority population in the first place. As is well-known, identifying as a homosexual male in no way impacts my ability to own a firearm or property, vote, travel freely between states or practice my religion. But every time I am segregated out by a specific legal or government standard defining me as different from the majority population, I risk exposure to political vindictiveness. By their very efforts at ensuring equality, they put in practice a system that makes me, as an individual, vulnerable to inequality.

It must be clearly stated that if LGBT Americans are to ever be included in the general population they must cease all efforts at legally and socially segregating themselves from that population. Regardless of the belief in a specialized need for resources, funding or other intangible government benefits, our individuality matters more than our category.

The notion that the government must count you as to ensure you are taken care of by them should be profoundly disturbing to anyone who values liberty and freedom. It seems the LGBT Left prefers the illusion of security instead. If it is up to me, I prefer to be counted as a citizen. It seems to me that this should be the goal of anyone promoting the idea of equality.

How To Respond With Reason And Compassion To Transgender Bullies,"A few years ago transgenderism was a niche issue on the periphery of American consciousness. Now it is at the contentious center of our politics and culture. This is not an organic development but the result of a well-coordinated campaign. There was not a sudden surge in scientific understanding of gender dysphoria and how to treat it, but there was a surge in activist efforts and the media’s promotion of them.

The tale they tell is that gender identity is distinct from bodily sex, immutable and knowable even at a young age. Therefore, those with gender dysphoria should immediately begin to transition (the younger the better), living as the sex they identify with, taking drugs to prevent puberty, and eventually undergoing “gender-affirming” chemical treatments and surgeries. Preventing or delaying transition—or even questioning someone’s gender identity—will inflict serious psychological harm, perhaps even inducing suicide.

This story has been effective, but as Ryan Anderson’s latest book, When Harry Became Sally, demonstrates, it is false. Against the claims of transgender activists that opposition to their agenda is intrinsically bigoted and necessarily harmful, Anderson systematically develops a compassionate alternative grounded in sound science, medicine, and philosophy.

Like all of his work, the book is well-written and strikes a reasonable balance between scholarly detail and general accessibility. Extensive footnotes provide sources for readers who wish to check particular claims or engage in further research.

This volume may be the most thorough response to transgender ideology and activism yet written, but amidst the myriad of points he addresses, Anderson is most concerned with the truth about sex and gender, and with what is therefore best for individuals with gender dysphoria. Although he addresses public policy, he did not write this book to rage about locker rooms and pronouns. Rather, Anderson asks, “What is the most loving and helpful response to the condition of gender dysphoria, a profound and often debilitating sense of alienation from one’s bodily sex?” He answers that it is to try to reconcile persons to their bodies, rather than to embark on a course of irreversible chemical and surgical body modification.

Contradictory Beliefs

Anderson argues transgender ideology relies upon an erroneous view of human nature and identity, and that living by this falsehood precludes full human flourishing. This is why the philosophical claims transgender activists make are full of contradictions, especially when taken in conjunction with the claims of their allies.

For instance, we are told that gender is a social construct, and that it is an immutable innate identity. We are told it is misogynist to say that men and women have different brains, and that the basis for transgenderism is having the brain of the opposite sex. We are told that subjective identity is reality, and that biological reality must be modified to “affirm” subjective identity. We are told that a man can know innately what it is to be a woman, and vice versa, as if our true self consists of some sort of incorporeal gender essence.

What unites these disparate and contradictory philosophical threads is their objection to the givenness of existence, especially human embodiment. Philosopher Soren Kierkegaard captured the pathos and farce of such existential alienation well: “How did I come to be involved in this great enterprise called actuality? Why should I be involved in it? Am I not free to decide? Am I to be forced to be part of it? Where is the manager, I would like to make a complaint!” We are thrown into being under conditions we do not choose; this is the price of existence.

But dissatisfaction with the reality of embodiment does not provide a coherent account of human persons, let alone human flourishing within our given existence. So because they object to the nature of existence as such, transgender activists cannot provide a coherent basis for their ideology. To plead a metaphysical cause, (i.e., we are gendered souls that can sometimes be stuck in the wrong body) turns the discussion into a religious and metaphysical debate that they are ill-equipped for. To plead a physiological (i.e., gendered brains stuck in the wrong body) or psychological source invites solutions focused on reconciling minds to their bodies, rather than modifying bodies into facsimiles of the other sex.

In contrast, Anderson argues that gender dysphoria arises from a variety of distinct, but often overlapping, factors (for instance, adult male-to-female transitions often have a sexual component). Far from being immutable, gender identity can change, and proper treatment for gender dysphoria should seek to reconcile those suffering from it to their physical bodies.

The view that a gender identity at odds with a person’s biological sex is fixed, and the only effective treatment for such gender dysphoria is “transition,” is insupportable scientifically and philosophically. The assertion that only transition can keep patients with gender dysphoria from committing suicide is rhetorical hostage-taking belied by the high rates of suicide and other self-destructive behaviors among those who identify as transgender. Transitioning does not remedy the underlying problems that have led someone to disassociate from his or her body.

In addition to responding to the claims of transgender ideology, Anderson also presents a positive account of sex and gender. The former is our bodily organization toward reproduction. “Sex, in terms of males or females, is identified by the organization of the organism for sexually reproductive acts. Sex as a status—male or female—is a recognition of the organization of a body that has the ability to engage in sex as an act.”

This fundamental difference between men and women naturally produces secondary sexual differences, though it is not defined by them. This differentiation is not disproven by cases of abnormal sexual development. Dysfunction, deformity, and damage are unfortunate imperfections, not healthy alternatives to the sexual dimorphism of the human species.

Emulation and Annihilation

Gender is “how we give social expression” to the “bodily, biological reality” of sex. Thus, Anderson observes that gender “properly understood is a social manifestation of human nature…Human beings are creatures of nature and of culture, but a healthy culture does not attempt to erase our nature as male or female embodied beings.” Gender is artificial only in the sense that everything human is artificial. Art is human nature, and gender is therefore a natural artifice. The realities of human biology influence the rest of human existence, and it is possible to recognize this truth while avoiding rigid and unduly restrictive stereotypes regarding sex and gender.

In a predictable irony, the transgender movement often promotes strict gender roles by encouraging gender nonconformists to transition; persons who identify as transgender frequently take on the most stereotypical gender attributes of the sex they are trying to emulate. These points have led to tension in the LGBT coalition, as some effeminate gay men and butch lesbians believe transgender ideology is erasing their identities. This internecine conflict highlights the contradictions of transgender ideology and how it fragments a person instead of a seeking an integrated, unified whole.

While it is undoubtedly deeply distressing to feel that one should not be the sex that one is, no amount of social transition, hormones, or even surgical amputation and alteration will change the physical reality of one’s sex. Transgender-identified persons must define themselves by something they can never be. For a man to claim to become a woman is both an emulation and annihilation of the reality of womanhood. To establish a gender identity opposite of one’s physical sex is to always have civil war raging within oneself as a dominant passion tyrannizes over the rest of one’s body and soul. It is also to be at war with the world, if one attempts to force others to affirm one’s subjective identity as objective fact.

We must be compassionate toward those with gender dysphoria, recognizing the distress it often induces. But real compassion tells the truth and seeks to make people whole. Authentic identities that promote genuine human flourishing must be based on truth. No matter how much transgender activists succeed in enforcing their ideology, reality will persist. The most heartbreaking portion of Anderson’s book is the chapter devoted to persons who have detransitioned. Except for Walt Heyer, these are not people likely to share Anderson’s social conservatism, but their stories make it clear that transitioning is not always the right treatment for gender dysphoria.

Bullying Their Way to Victory

Even if some persons were better off transitioning, the problem of distinguishing between them and those whose gender dysphoria requires another response would remain. Unfortunately, the demands of activists harm the latter by pushing them into transition. Children are told that to be themselves, they have to permanently alter their bodies.

Anderson notes that activists in multiple states have succeeded in making it illegal for therapists to try to reconcile children with gender dysphoria to their bodies, so that “a doctor who helps a young boy socially and hormonally transition into a ‘girl’ does not violate the law, but a doctor who helps a young boy identify with and accept his body might be acting unlawfully.” Instead of protecting children, such ideologically motivated laws subject them to harmful treatments and irreversible body modifications.

Given time, an overwhelming majority (80 to 95 percent) of children with gender dysphoria will come to identify with their biological sex. However, transgender activists insist the only treatment for gender dysphoria is immediate transition, and they are threatening medical professionals to get it. Respected researchers and clinicians like Dr. Kenneth Zucker, many of whom endorse transition in some cases, have been demonized and driven from their positions because they would not fully embrace transgender activists’ radical agenda.

This is intimidation, not reasoned scientific consensus. The result is that children with gender dysphoria who would have naturally reconciled to their bodies are instead being pushed to transition, with irreversible amputations, chemical treatments, and a lifelong dependence on pharmaceuticals. This one-size-fits-all approach to treating children should disconcert even those who generally support the LGBT movement.

Despite the attempts of major LGBT activist groups and their media allies to present a unified front, real divisions have been created by the radicalism of transgender activists. For instance, some feminists have been driven into previously unthinkable alliances with social conservatives. Anderson points out many persons who identity as transgender do not share the radical views of the activists. Bruce/Caitlyn Jenner, likely the most famous trans-identifying person in American, seems to be in this category, and has been attacked for it by activists.

Unfortunately, the radical transgender activists are driving media coverage, public policy, and medical treatment. They do not wish for dialogue, discussion, or compromise; instead they seek to bully their way to victory. This is why the critical responses to Anderson have consisted of anecdotes and accusations of bigotry against him and his sources, rather than reasoned responses to his central claims. But for all its apparent momentum, we may hope that the transgender moment will soon pass.

The hatred and lies directed at even a careful scholar like Anderson reveal a movement that is brittle and afraid despite its triumphs. Its contradictions are unsustainable, and we should hope that treatments based not on ideology, but on compassion and the truth of our existence as embodied beings, will soon be provided to those suffering from gender dysphoria. Anderson’s book is an important response to an ideology that is hurting people, most of all the children who are having their natural physical development blocked and their bodies hormonally and surgically modified in an attempt to become something they can never be.

LGBT Festival In His Hometown To Spite Mike Pence Is Not A Good Look,"Columbus, Indiana hosted its first LGBT pride festival April 14, and by all accounts, it was a success. The event was planned and spearheaded by a high school student named Erin Bailey who began planning the event as a school project. More than 1,000 people reportedly attended, and the town’s population of 47,000 welcomed them generously with rainbow banners in the streets. The Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT rights organization, supported, promoted and attended the event as well.

When the event was first announced in late March of this year, it received recognition from dozens of international media outlets that celebrated the festival. Unfortunately, the enthusiasm had absolutely nothing to do with LGBT pride, equality or the ambitious efforts of an 18-year-old student hoping to bring laughter and celebration to her town. The focus was exclusively on the fact that the event was happening in Vice President Mike Pence’s hometown.

In March, Bailey stated, “I am organizing Columbus Pride Festival because I feel it is important for members of the LGBTQ community to know that Columbus is a welcoming and diverse community … Even though Pence is openly anti-gay, that doesn’t mean that all of us in his hometown are.”

The Human Rights Campaign, while listing a string of anti-LGBT offenses ranging from opposing same-sex marriage to supporting religious freedom laws and most absurdly, citing Trump once saying Pence would “hang” all gay people, declared, “We are honored to participate in Columbus’ inaugural LGBT Pride Festival and prove once again that love trumps hate … By fearlessly standing up for equality, Erin Bailey is showing Pence, who has a long, disturbing record of attacking and demonizing the LGBTQ community, that Hoosiers won’t stand for his brand of discriminatory politics.”

The Human Rights Campaign tweeted about the event reiterating this same message and tagged the Vice President. The event featured rainbow signs declaring “No Pride in Pence” and “Love Not Hate Columbus.” The mock-Catholic-Nun group called “The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence” attended with a sign titled “More Fornication Less Hate.”

Calling out Pence’s supposed support for gay conversion therapy, a t-shirt stating “Conversion Camp Orgies Are Intense” was captured as well as a mock Pence look-a-like named “Mike Hot Pence” in a suit jacket, rainbow tie and shorts carrying a charity bucket labeled “Mike Hot Pence Cares About LGBTQ Youth.” Bil Browning of LGBTQ Nation, an LGBT news site, who attended the event posted, “Over 1,000 people turned out for the first pride festival in Pence’s hometown. 20 years ago, a thousand people prayed in the streets of Columbus against giving gay couples insurance benefits. Looks like God answered their prayers in an unexpected way. Maybe Pence should take notice.”

Anticipating possible counter-protests, the local police were on the scene and prepared and when asked about hateful protestors, Bailey said, “I know there’s going to be a whole lot more supporters than there are people against so I’m just going to surround myself with the good people and if anyone comes we just won’t give them any attention.” As Browning reluctantly ended his report of the event confirming, “No religious zealots protested at the festival today.”

“Vice President Pence commends Erin Bailey for her activism and engagement in the civic process,” Pence spokeswoman Alyssa Farah said in a statement on the event. “As a proud Hoosier and Columbus native, he’s heartened to see young people from his hometown getting involved in the political process.”

Baily responded that if he were to attend, “I would ask him why he feels the way he does about LGBT people and their rights, and his stance on women having rights to their own body,” and complained that his statement of support was “vague” and “not sincere,” “because of what I know he really feels.” She added, “If Pence attends, I would thank him for coming and opening his mind to see the diversity in his hometown!”

When I was a senior in college, I spearheaded the first public celebration of Israel in our city. I brought up the idea to my Yiddish choir and despite skepticism at the potential interest or success, convinced members of my synagogue to support me in getting it started. I asked a local, highly pro-Israel church if they had interest and before we knew it we had more speakers than we had time for. I designed a t-shirt that we gave out for free and ran out within the first 30 minutes. The event was surprisingly popular, non-political or controversial and if I remember correctly, brought out about three counter-protesters. The event was inspired by an anti-Israel event on my campus and through discussion we decided the best response would be a positive celebration.

The event ran for four years and we always made sure it was focused on celebrating Israeli culture, history and the unity of support from diverse groups. From the start we all agreed not to use the event as a platform for political discussion, opposition or any form of protesting because we wanted our voice to be one of hope and honesty rather than opposition. In contrast, the anti-Israel events on campus were always characterized by explicitly oppositional messaging and often, hostile expression. We wanted to show the community what unity and celebration of Israel looked like rather than simply another argument.

Gay pride was once an expression of individuality and personal expression that required no larger social support or approval. It has slowly become little more than a confrontational opposition to the perceived larger population’s views and opinions. What is truly sad about this event is that this should have been an accomplishment and a celebration. Columbus just under an hour away from Indianapolis which has hosted gay pride events since the 1980s. LGBT members living in Pence’s hometown were not isolated away from gay culture or access to public celebration. Nothing Pence ever proposed or stood for would have prevented them from enjoying it. They have had the opportunity to publicly celebrate for decades. Their singular motivation was to confront a man who represents everything they believe they oppose at a time when said opposition is popular in Left-wing culture.

This young woman did something remarkable in organizing an event in which the entire city celebrated. There were no protests, no obstacles or any public or private opposition presented to them. They were free to celebrate in any way they wanted to with full support of their community. This should have been something to be proud of. Instead the only reason the LGBT media and larger community took interest was in the delicious irony of celebrating gay pride openly in the very hometown of their designated enemy as a show of defiance. The attention moved away from the accomplishment of this high school student to mocking and attacking the idea of a man they collectively hate.

The young woman said it was part of a class project. “I knew I wanted mine to really change the community,” she said. “I wanted to impact the whole city and make the LGBT community feel more welcome here.” She added, referring to Pence: “I’m not doing this in spite of him. We are so much more than just a small town that he grew up in.”

But the event was in spite of him and he was the singular focus of attention. The LGBT community wanted to take a jab at the vice president and they danced in the streets exclusively to do so. Their sense of identity wrapped around their opposition to a man they know nothing about but who represents everything they fight against.

Celebration of identity can be positive and any opportunity to bring a community together for shared values should be embraced. But public events designed exclusively to mock, attack, or confront an enemy, real or imaginary, do nothing but spread animosity and hostility. It is almost as if they were hoping for controversy in order to shine a brighter light on whatever it is they were hoping to expose with this event.

Clearly that did not materialize. As of this writing, very few publications have even mentioned the post-festivities and despite two major LGBT media groups attending, the day received minimal attention. This young lady will be remembered as leading the “first LGBT pride festival in Pence’s hometown” rather than as a leader in bringing her community together for a celebration of unity and uniqueness. The only person to recognize her for her work and truly celebrate her efforts was the very man she organized the event in defiance of.

What’s Behind Anchorage’s Failure To Secure Women’s Bathrooms?,"On Tuesday, the Anchorage City Clerk made it official: Voters rejected Proposition 1, the citizen-initiated ballot proposal that would have required government-run facilities to maintain single-sex bathrooms and locker rooms, while allowing private businesses the right to decide their own privacy policies. The city certified the final tally of the voting, which ended on April 3, 2018, with “no” votes garnering 41,115 or 52.6 percent, to the “yes” votes of 36,993 or 47.4 percent.

In heralding the victory, LGBT activists portray the first rejection by voters of a so-called bathroom bill as representative of a change in public opinion. The Chicago Tribune reported that transgender activist Lillian Lennon pronounced the defeat of Proposition 1 not just “a victory for Anchorage, but a victory nationally,” adding “[t]ransgender discrimination is popping up everywhere, and this victory means that as a nation we can stand together against discrimination.”

Public pressure and boycotts have previously succeeded in getting state representatives to change course, such as the widely watched spectacle of the North Carolina legislature undoing the privacy protection granted citizens through a requirement that government restrooms remain single-sex, after the NCAA and some businesses pulled out of the state. Of course, Indiana’s reversal that converted a religious freedom law into legal preferences for LGBT-identified people was the modern watershed moment on this.

In contrast, when voters—and not legislators—decided the issue in 2015 in Houston, “[b]y a margin of 61 percent to 39 percent,” city residents overturned the Houston City Council’s ordinance permitting men suffering from gender dysphoria to use women’s restrooms (and vice versa), after “mount[ing] a campaign using the slogan ‘No Men in Women’s Bathrooms.’”

Several dynamics in play may have pushed the “no” vote to victory in Anchorage. First, the LGBT activism was well-funded, with opponents raising a reported $826,000, compared to the $140,000 raised by Alaska Family Action, the sponsor of Proposition 1. The “no” campaign was also well-organized, with the American Civil Liberties Union prioritizing defeat of the local referendum: In February, ACLU attorneys held a conference call with the media to “highlight the fight to defeat Proposition 1 in Anchorage, Alaska,” and gave Lennon a platform to discuss his efforts to lobby against the proposed law.

Lennon, a field organizer for Fair Anchorage, a local organization dedicated to defeating Proposition 1, took the spring semester off from the University of Alaska-Anchorage to push for a “no” vote. With Anchorage housing Alaska’s largest university, Lennon’s outreach efforts likely reached a more liberal base than year-round Anchorage residents. Also, for the first time, Anchorage allowed all registered voters to cast their ballots by mail.

Anchorage’s reliance on tourism also had a likely impact. According to the Chicago Tribune, John Kauffman, an Anchorage attorney who lobbied against Proposition 1, thought “[t]he experience of North Carolina seems to be a pretty good case study on the national reaction, kind of significant and fairly united national reaction to this kind of ordinance or law or proposition,” adding that “Anchorage is much more isolated than North Carolina and the bathroom measure could have hurt the city.”

Whether Anchorage’s results will translate elsewhere remains to be seen. But proponents of privacy and the protection of children should learn the lessons of the Alaska experience: Transgender activists are well-funded and well-organized, and have succeeded in scaring politicians and businesses into obeying their will.

Their sights are already turned to the next battleground, Massachusetts, where citizens will vote in November on whether to repeal a state law that forces places of public accommodation to allow men identifying as women (or women identifying as men) to access the bathrooms and locker rooms of the opposite sex.

A victory for transgender activists in liberal Massachusetts may not be the hardest sell, but it will add to the momentum the Left is seeking to upend society. With every win, the narrative builds that it is discrimination to believe men are men and women are women. As that perception becomes more mainstream, the populace retreats in silent acquiescence, either believing perception is reality, or fearing the bigot label.

However, just as a man cannot become a woman, or a woman a man, it is not discrimination or bigotry to say as much. But now—before the cultural tide has irrevocably turned—is the time to proclaim that truth. And that time is becoming increasingly short.

Snopes Is a Sneaky Liar About California’s Bill To Ban Christian LGBT Talk,"If you haven’t already lost significant respect for Snopes as an impartial fact-checker, its analysis of a bill that bans all transactions involved in stating Christian beliefs about homosexual behavior should. That bill passed 50-18 on April 19 and is being considered in the state senate. Snopes’ insistence that California Assembly Bill 2943 would not result in the Bible being banned in California is akin to Snopes calling “demonstrably and clearly false” the claim that Joseph Stalin killed everyone around him.

True, Stalin did not kill “all” around him. Indeed, so far as we know he never personally killed anyone. But he did have a great many people killed (estimates indicate that he was responsible for the deaths of 20 to 25 million people), sent many others to the Gulag, and generally terrorized both his own country and Eastern Europe for decades.

Sure, it is virtually impossible that California will immediately attempt to ban the sale of the Bible itself. Not even the hard Left in California has that kind of chutzpah. But citations of Bible verses in the context of declaring homosexual practice and transgenderism to be morally debased could indeed get one into serious trouble with the law if it comes in the context of selling or advertising a product or service. Here are the problems with Snopes’s case.

Have You Ever Read a Bill Before?

First, Snopes states that since “California Assembly Bill 2943 does not mention the Bible, Christianity, or religion at all,” any claim that “the legislation would ‘literally’ prohibit the sale of the Bible, … is demonstrably and clearly false.” Yet the fact that the bill doesn’t explicitly mention these things is irrelevant if the wording of the bill is broad enough to encompass them.

Second, Snopes stresses that, based on a 2011 bill outlawing “sexual orientation change efforts” (SOCE) on persons under the age of 18, the new bill outlawing it for adults should also be restricted to “mental health providers that seek to change an individual’s sexual orientation.”

However, even Snopes has to admit that AB 2943 “also appears to prohibit SOCE from being performed by any individual, not just by mental health providers.” So you could be a pastor, Bible study or house church leader, member of a parachurch organization working to help people afflicted by same-sex attractions, or indeed anybody who attempts change if goods or services involve an exchange of funds.

Snopes adds: “The Assembly Judiciary Committee’s analysis notes it is not clear whether the text of A.B. 2943 would amount to a blanket prohibition on any and all SOCE. We contacted Low’s office for clarification on this point but did not receive a response in time for publication.” Given the track record of zealous LGBTQ advocacy in this country, where coercive affirmations of “gay marriage” have been found in the Fourteenth Amendment (1868) that grants full citizenship rights to ex-slaves and in interpreting the Title IX ban of “sex discrimination” in schools and colleges (1972) to include discrimination based on homosexual practice and transgender identity, “unclear” means: We will use this law against you.

Outlawing Politically Disfavored Religious Instruction

Third, Snopes then heavily shades the truth: “What is clear is that Low’s bill does not seek to outlaw all religious or moral instruction regarding sexuality and sexual orientation.” How much stress is being placed on the “all”? Even Snopes cannot say that it will not outlaw “some or most religious or moral instruction regarding sexuality and sexual orientation.”

Yet Snopes is not willing to highlight that as a point in its discussion. The emphasis is on the narrative: Keep walking, nothing disturbing here for religious folk. The salient point is that nothing in the bill would prevent the state from outlawing all religious or moral instruction that seeks to change homosexual behavior and transgender identity. The only limitation on the state is its own self-policed chutzpah regarding “LGBTQ” coercion.

Read the bill. There is no religious exemption. There is no restriction to mental health professionals. There is not even a restriction to claims about changing a person’s sexual orientation or transgender feelings in whole or part. The bill is quite clear that any “efforts to change behaviors or gender expressions” are included in the ban on attempts to change a person’s “sexual orientation.”

So you would be violating the law if you advertise that Christ can empower people not to engage in homosexual practice or not to identify as “gay” or “transgender” because such behaviors and self-identities are morally wrong, or if you offer to engage or actually engage in efforts to persuade people of Christ’s power to transform in this area, you will be in violation of California AB 2943, at least so long as your advertising or efforts involved in any way an exchange of money for goods or services.

Consequently, selling religious or secular books (pamphlets, videos, audios, etc.), holding conferences, teaching courses in a college or seminary where tuition is paid, giving a speech at a paid venue, counseling people for a fee, or perhaps even posting online articles in a site that requires a paid subscription, in which it is asserted (in whole or part) that it is morally wrong for people to engage in homosexual practice or identify as “gay” or “transgender,” all could be treated as a violation of California Assembly Bill 2943.

There is certainly nothing in the bill that exempts such practices from prosecution by the state. We have learned on LGBTQ matters what is exempted is not exempted for long and what is not exempted has no exemption. If you haven’t figured this out by now, you haven’t been paying attention.

Only Promoting LGBT Behavior Is Allowed

Am I alone in this view? Religious liberties lawyer David French has referred to this as “a bill that would actually — among other things — ban the sale of books expressing orthodox Christian beliefs about sexual morality.” Alliance Defending Freedom attorney Matt Sharp states: “It would be a violation if a pastor encourages a congregant to visit the church book store to purchase books that help people address sexual issues, perhaps including the Bible itself, which teaches about the importance of sexual purity within the confines of marriage between a man and a woman.”

Matt Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, a public interest religious freedom law firm, told me I could print this comment from him: “The breadth of this bill is staggering and represents the worst kinds of censoring because books and educational resources along with scientific research will be banned. The First Amendment provides not space for this kind of censorship.”

Constitutional law attorney Jenna Ellis concludes: “A Christian bookstore could be sued for carrying a book such as Ryan T. Anderson’s latest, When Harry Became Sally, solely because the message is in conflict with the LGBT agenda…. Thus, this law is not viewpoint neutral and specifically targets psychotherapists, counselors, pastors, lay counselors, authors, speakers, and any other speakers from promoting a message of heterosexuality, and instead allows only a message affirming the LGBT viewpoint.”

The Snopes articles makes it sound like Christians have nothing to fear from this bill, that the bill won’t have the effect of chilling all speech and inhibiting the sale and use of all texts that indicate that homosexual practice and transgender identity are morally wrong. Don’t you believe it for a moment.

"If CA's LGBT Therapy Ban Had Been Law, I Might Have Killed Myself","While living in California more than 30 years ago, I had access to sound, effective, time-tested psychotherapy. Because of it, I walked away from the transgender life I had lived as Laura Jensen for eight years in San Francisco.

Yet if I had been prevented from having access to such people and materials, as Assembly Bill 2943 proposes, the bill would have been a “stay trans and die” bill for me. I wanted to have access to restoration and redemption from my transgender life, but AB 2943 would make that illegal. The bill intends to prevent any access to what is potentially lifesaving psychotherapy for people who identify as transgender, like I did.

California Family Council points out that AB 2943 prevents counselors from helping adult clients deal with unwanted same-sex attraction or gender confusion, and prohibits authors from selling a book, or even a church from hosting a ticketed conference, addressing these topics.

I started my journey toward redemption and the restoration of my male gender on April 7, 1990, with the help of two outstanding Christian therapists to whom I owe my life. The healing psychotherapy provided me has resulted in 32 years of sobriety, complete restoration of my male gender for 28 years, and marriage to a wonderful woman for 21 years. I speak out for the others who feel hopeless and stuck in a lifestyle that doesn’t fit them anymore.

If AB 2943 were in place back in the 1990s, most likely I would have died from suicide or, as this bill proposes, once I embraced my life as a trans-woman, I was sentenced for life. The bill’s authors want to make sure the gender-dysphoric people they claim to be “helping” have no way out, even if that’s what they desperately want. Only an uncaring legislature would sign such a draconian bill into law.

People Detransition All the Time

If you think detransitions are rare, just Google “detransition” and see the multitude of videos from courageous formerly trans people who tell of the peace they have found with their God-given gender through a combination of counseling and faith. If this bill becomes law, these people will no longer have access to help they choose, because apparently some in California’s government think no one should be allowed to change his or her mind about what constitutes being at peace with one’s sex.

“People have the right to seek the counsel of their choice, but this bill substitutes the government for personal choice,” says Liberty Counsel founder Mat Staver. People entering into psychotherapy for gender dysphoria would no longer have the freedom of setting their treatment goals if those goals differ from the government-mandated one.

AB 2943 prevents access guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution to all opinions, no matter if opposing voices disagree. AB2943 is an affront to Americans’ civil rights, religious rights, and Constitution-guaranteed freedom of speech. This state law would impose one viewpoint and outlaw all others. The only viewpoint it would permit is that people who express a different gender must be affirmed and guided toward transition to the fake gender. No alternative path is allowed, regardless of the person’s wishes. Once someone considers a gender change, he or she must pursue it or else.

AB 2932 has teeth. It proposes to financially ruin those who provide information contrary to the LGBT ideology on gender and sex. Anyone who sells books, counseling services, or anything else that helps someone overcome unwanted transgender identity can be charged with engaging in “unfair or deceptive acts or practices” and be obligated to pay punitive damages, court costs, and attorney’s fees.

Included in the wide net of “unfair or deceptive acts or practices” is the sale of memoirs and personal stories featuring people who left the trans-world and how. Evidence that people return to living happily in their birth gender, like I did, would be suppressed

AB 2943 says “advertising, offering to engage in, or engaging in” efforts to change sexual behaviors or gender expressions would be illegal under the California’s Consumers Legal Remedies Act. It specifically outlaws telling a client about poor outcomes that can arise from gender change or suggesting that psychological counseling is helpful in resolving gender confusion.

While I still have the freedom to speak without fear of punishment, I will tell you what the authors of this bill don’t want you to know.

The Science On Gender Isn’t Settled

When an individual self-identifies as being the other gender, this is not objectively provable through science, medicine, or biological truth. It is simply an idea some people have. It can be a strongly held idea, but it is a fantasy that has serious consequences.

This diverse population has a need to act out their cross-gender masquerade. This should strongly suggest that something much deeper sexually, emotionally, or psychologically is causing this unusual behavior. For some I know personally, deep inside remains unresolved grief and pain that just will not go away. Unresolved pathologies need to be discovered and treated before cross-gender hormones are taken and any gender surgeries are performed, to ensure these drastic alterations to one’s body are actually addressing the real needs of the person.

I hear from those whose lives have been broken because gender-change treatment was the only option provided. Years afterward, when they find themselves discontent or depressed even though they are accepted as the other gender, the lucky ones seek access to effective psychotherapy. The unfortunate ones live a despondent life, or fall prey to suicide ideation. Some quietly return to their birth gender, wondering “What happened?”

We do not know enough to say for certain that gender-change surgery and hormones are the right choices for every person who considers them. Significant gaps in scientific knowledge and research exist regarding transgender health. A review of 2,405 articles published through June 2016 focused on transgender health and concludes that “most of the published work that exists is not primary research, and there are very few studies that look at long-term outcomes.”

California AB 2943 would prevent me from sharing that self-identified transgender people largely suffer psychiatric, psychological, or sexual disorders that are not effectively treated as prescribed by the standards of care issued by the politically driven World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH). A 2014 study showed that 62.7 percent have co-existing psychiatric disorders such as depression, phobias, adjustment disorders, and extreme anxiety.

People Deserve the Freedom to Consider All Options

Gender dysphoria or cross-gender expression can evolve from difficult family situations where children are caught between battling parents, placed in foster care, or live in other types of unsettling environments that result in the child feeling depressed and anxious over a long period.

A 2016 study shows a high prevalence of psychiatric diagnoses in a community-recruited sample of young transgender women. Forty-one percent of participants had one or more mental health or substance dependence diagnoses. The researchers concluded: “Improving access to routine primary care, diagnostic screening, psychotherapy, and pharmacologic treatments, and retention in care in clinical community-based, pediatric, and adolescent medicine settings are urgently needed to address mental health and substance dependence disorders in this population.”

People would not be allowed to hear about the failure of sex change to resolve gender confusion or about the high rate of attempted suicide after taking cross-gender hormones.

When I ask the individuals who contact me about having difficulty in their chosen gender, 100 percent of the time they can pinpoint a situation in their childhood that strongly contributed to development of gender incongruence. California is outlawing access to information and counseling that would help this population recover from the effects of childhood events.

People would not be allowed to hear about the failure of sex change to resolve gender confusion or about the high rate of attempted suicide after taking cross-gender hormones and undergoing gender change surgeries. It is important to understand that transgender suicide is not caused by discrimination or family or societal rejection. According to suicide.org, 90 percent of all people who die by their own hand, including those who identify as transgender, have untreated mental illness.

AB 2943 would not allow me to share that autogynephilia, an erotic or affection phenomenon, can lead to a misguided request for gender-change surgery. Autogynephilic men fall in love with the idea of themselves as women. They will seek sex reassignment because they are sexually aroused by the idea of having breast implants and other cosmetic surgery to feminize their appearance. They are the object of their own affection.

From my observations in speaking with people with this condition, they realize after surgery, often years after, that the clinicians who approved and supported their surgical gender changes are clueless about diagnosing autogynephilia. For them, cross-gender hormone therapy and gender surgeries weren’t appropriate treatment. Because the clinicians affirmed their misplaced desire to become women, their lives were upended and severely impacted.

Consumer fraud is serious business, and that’s why California’s Consumers Legal Remedies Act exists. But to use it to mandate state-determined psychotherapy goals and to call public debate a “false and deceptive practice” is a mistake. The state has overstepped. Cross-gender expression is too complex a subject to be legislated. This bill would harm the very individuals it proposes to help and protect.

Prominent LGBTQ Group Not Buying Joy-Ann Reid's Hacking Claims,"An LGBTQ advocacy group announced it will no longer give an award to MSNBC’s Joy-Ann Reid after posts calling same-sex acts “gross” resurfaced this week on her now-defunct blog, “The Reid Report.” Reid maintains that her old blog was hacked by someone trying to make her look bad, but the Internet Archive, the nonprofit that powers the “Wayback Machine,” is disputing Reid’s claim.

In a statement released Tuesday, PFLAG (Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays) announced they have decided to rescind the Straight for Equality in Media award they had planned to give the MSNBC host. In December 2017, Reid apologized for old blog posts in which she mocked then-congressman Charlie Christ as being a closeted gay man named “Miss Charlie.”

Additional blog posts along these lines resurfaced earlier this week, but Reid and her attorneys have maintained that her website was hacked and that the Wayback Machine’s archives were tampered with by an external actor, a claim the Internet Archive denies.

“When we reviewed the archives, we found nothing to indicate tampering or hacking of the Wayback Machine versions,” Internet Archive officer manager Chris Butler stated to BuzzFeed News. “At least some of the examples of allegedly fraudulent posts provided to us had been archived at different dates and by different entities.”

Previously PFLAG stated it would give Reid the award anyway because she apologized, but now it says the most recent blog posts and Reid’s insistence that she was hacked has pushed the nonprofit organization to rescind the honor.

“When we extended our invitation to Ms. Reid to honor her at our 45th anniversary celebration, we did so knowing about the blog posts from the late 2000s regarding Charlie Crist,” PFLAG National president Jean Hodges said in a statement. “We appreciated how she stepped up, took ownership, apologized for them, and did better—this is the behavior and approach we ask of any ally. However, in light of new information, and the ongoing investigation of that information, we must at this time rescind our award to Ms. Reid.”

FactCheck.org Is Wrong. California’s LGBT Therapy Ban Could Ban Bibles,"FactCheck.org has joined Snopes as another sneaky liar with their article on Apr. 25 entitled “California Bill Wouldn’t Ban the Bible.” Although per the “Editor’s note,” “FactCheck.org describes itself is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories,” it is not without its left-wing biases.

Article author Angelo Fichera claims that California Assembly Bill 2943 has no bearing on the sale not only of the Bible but also of any Christian book that makes the case, in whole or part, for orientation, identity, or behavior change. Although Fichera asserts claims about AB 2943 banning books “are indeed not supported by the language in the legislation,” he does not actually analyze the contents of the bill.

The extent of his “research” is to cite a tweet from the bill’s author, California assemblyman Evan Low, and an email from attorney Anthony J. Samson, a registered state lobbyist who “provided Low with technical assistance on the bill.” Another quote from Samson is now offered in the updated Snopes article.

Low and Samson are hardly impartial sources. They have a vested interest in getting the bill passed into law before massive opposition can galvanize. FactCheck.org never bothered to do the most basic investigative work of all: “factcheck” the bill’s author and his assisting attorney in relation to the language of AB 2943.

FactCheck.org would never take Donald Trump’s or Jeff Sessions’s word for what a certain anti-immigration bill of theirs says. So why does FactCheck.org take the word of Low and Samson about what AB 2943 allegedly says, particularly since it appears to be at odds with the wording of the bill?

Courts Have Trashed Bill History in LGBT Cases

Low tweeted on Apr. 22: “A church or individual may still practice conversion therapy if they do so without charging for this fraudulent service. It does not ban bibles nor does it ban the basic sales of books as some would have you believe.” To this we can add Low’s statement to the state assembly just minutes before the vote, in which he alleged the sale of a book is not an actual conversion therapy “practice,” which the bill bans.

Samson sent an email to FactCheck.org saying: “The bill by its express terms is limited to the practice of conversion therapy as a commercial service in exchange for monetary compensation.” Samson added in an email to Snopes: “It does not apply to the sale of books or any other kind of goods, and it does not prevent anyone from speaking or writing on the subject of conversion therapy in any forum.”

Let’s review what AB 2943 says, as opposed to how Low and Samson characterize it. That’s critical because the wording is what ultimately determines its legal enforcement. Yes, California courts may consider the legislative history of a bill when ruling on its meaning, but “only where statutory language is ambiguous.” Even then, it is not binding and comprises only one component of the court’s opinion. A court could easily decide that the wording of AB 2943 is not ambiguous on this point, as we shall see.

In addition, past experience suggests legislative history often means relatively little in relation to court decisions on LGBT matters. The classic examples are the same-sex marriage decisions of the California Supreme Court in 2008 (4-3), the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in 2010, and the U.S. Supreme Court in 2015 (5-4), all of which were based on finding a “fundamental right” to same-sex marriage in the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Yet this amendment addressed citizen rights of former slaves, not “gay marriage.” No one who had a hand in formulating and passing this amendment in 1866-68 would have done so if it had occurred to them that same-sex marriage could be a possible result. Of what value was legislative history here? None.

By the same token, did the Obama administration honor the legislative history of Title IX (passed in 1972) when it decided to interpret “sex discrimination” to include “gender identity” and “sexual orientation”? Who could have imagined that when “sexual orientation” non-discrimination laws were passed in the 1980s and 1990s it would lead to Christian bakers, florists, and photographers being fined tens of thousands of dollars and put out of business? Or children compelled to undergo gender identity indoctrination from kindergarten on?

What AB 2943 Actually Says Implies Bible Bans

You might think that AB 2943 applies only to psychotherapeutic “practices” in contradistinction to other “efforts.” You would be wrong. “This bill intends to make clear that sexual orientation change efforts are an unlawful practice under California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act,” the bill says. Ergo, any “effort” at “sexual orientation change” constitutes “an unlawful practice.”

Moreover, “‘sexual orientation change efforts’ means any practices that seek to change an individual’s sexual orientation.” Catch that? “Any practices,” not exclusively those of a psychotherapeutic sort.

You might suppose that AB 2943 has restraints on its application to avoid encroachments on freedoms of speech and religion. You would be wrong. The bill specifies only one restraint: These “sexual orientation change efforts” must occur in the context of a “transaction intended to result, or which results, in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer.” Obviously, the sale of a book is a “transaction” that “results in the sale . . . of goods . . . to any consumer.”

Even so, you might surmise that the bill applies only to mental health professionals and not also to religious organizations or individuals, since that limitation existed in the 2012 law forbidding sexual orientation change therapy for minors. You would be wrong. AB 2943 applies to “unfair or deceptive acts or practices undertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result, or which results, in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer” (my emphasis).

You might think that “sexual orientation change efforts” entails only efforts “to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.” You would be wrong. According to the bill, it includes also “efforts to change behaviors or gender expressions.” Thus, any sale of a book that makes statements that homosexual practice or transgender identification are immoral actions that people ought not to commit falls easily under the purview of AB 2943.

You might think that a transaction has to take place before the law’s penalty can apply. You would be wrong. Also prohibited by this bill is “advertising, offering for sale, or selling a financial product that is illegal.” Merely advertising (e.g., on one’s Facebook page or some other Internet site) or offering for sale (e.g., on a table at a conference, regardless of whether copies are sold) “a financial product” that advocates a change of attractions, behavior, or gender expression away from the “LGBTQ” mantra is fair game.

You might think (by now a little flustered) that at least the prohibited advertising is limited to advertising a counselor’s practice. You would be wrong. It rather includes (to judge from a stipulation of the bill regarding veterans affairs) “advertising or promoting any event, presentation, seminar, workshop, or other public gathering.”

Thus, any conference or lecture would apply if a fee is charged for attending or if “goods or services” are advertised or made available in the course of the “event.” Indeed, I can’t see why this wouldn’t also apply to a course offered at a college or seminary if tuition is charged for that course.

Bill’s Author Agrees It Can Apply to Churches

Now let’s go back and see how the bill’s actual wording applies to Low and Samson’s remarks. Low’s first comment in his tweet is a devastating new admission: “A church or individual may still practice conversion therapy if they do so without charging for this fraudulent service.” The flipside of this statement is that “a church or individual” cannot “practice conversion therapy” if there is a charge for the service.

There is no puzzling over whether the sale of ‘books’ could count as a sale of ‘goods.’ It’s obvious.

Contrary to what many supporters of the bill have been saying, the bill’s application extends beyond mental health professionals (note that the Snopes article claims this is unclear). There is no exemption for religious instruction. We now have confirmation from AB 2943’s author that the bill would indeed apply “to a pastor, Bible study or house church leader, member of a parachurch organization working to help people afflicted by same-sex attractions, or indeed anybody who attempts change if goods or services involve an exchange of funds.”

AB 2493’s wording does not support Low’s second statement: “It does not ban bibles nor does it ban the basic sales of books as some would have you believe.” The only way that such a statement, particularly the second half, could be true is if the sale of a book were not included as “a transaction . . . which results in the sale . . . of goods . . . to any consumer” or did not come under the heading of “selling a financial product.” It is difficult to see how that could be the case.

For example, the California government’s own guide to “Understanding California’s Sales Tax” gives as its first example of how “sales tax . . . depends on the tax rate and the dollar value of the goods sold” that of a retailer who “sells five books costing $20 each” at a tax rate of 8 percent (my emphases). There is no puzzling over whether the sale of “books” could count as a sale of “goods.” It’s obvious.

“Goods” are broadly defined in AB 2943 as “tangible [movable] chattels bought or leased for use primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.” By what rationale, then, can Low claim the sale of books is excluded from the bill’s designation “sale of goods”? If Low were so concerned to exclude book sales from his bill, he would have to have excluded “books” from the category of “goods” explicitly.

People Can Be Prosecuted for Recommending Books

Oddly, Low also claims AB 2943 does not “ban the basic sales of books.” What limitation does the adjective “basic” place on “sales”? Does he mean only book sales not made in conjunction with other efforts to change the behavior, identity, or attractions of specific individuals? His qualification reminds me of constitutional lawyer David French’s observation in a recent National Review article.

While the state might not immediately ban the sale of certain books, it could prosecute someone who recommended or shared such books.

To be sure, it is probably “too much even for [the California government] to sweep through Christian bookstores looking for books” that caution against homosexual practice or transgenderism, although French hastens to add that “the statute would empower such an action.” Nevertheless, “it’s far more likely that the recommendation or sharing of certain kinds of Christian books and other written materials would be deemed evidence of fraud and would present a core part of the case against a minister or counselor.”

In other words, while the state might not immediately ban the sale of certain books, it could prosecute someone who recommended or shared such books with a person struggling with same-sex or transgender desires. The state could also prosecute someone who, at an event in which books advocating against homosexual practice or transgenderism are sold, urges homosexually active or transgender-identified persons in an audience to change their behavior.

After people adjust to this draconian step, the state might well decide to use the law to ban books outright. In the meantime, as French adds, “the law would loom over booksellers and churches, establishing a chilling effect and providing a pretext for even more secular booksellers to refrain from stocking certain Christian titles.”

If Money Changes Hands, This Bill Applies

Samson makes an even more blatant distortion about books in the updated Snopes article, claiming AB 2943 “does not apply to the sale of books or any other kind of goods.” Pray tell, then, what exactly is the bill talking about when it refers to “unfair or deceptive acts or practices . . . intended to result, or which results, in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer” (my emphasis)? The sale of “goods” is mentioned a whopping 18 times in the bill in connection with fraudulent practices.

If Samson had intended the limitations he specifies in his email, why didn’t he advise Low to put them in the bill?

Samson adds: “It does not prevent anyone from speaking or writing on the subject of conversion therapy in any forum” (my emphases). If he had said “everyone,” he would be correct (a monetary transaction is required); “anyone” is certainly false. The bill is clear that it pertains to “anyone” involved in “advertising, offering to engage in, or engaging in sexual orientation change efforts with an individual,” broadly defined as “any practices that seek to change an individual’s sexual orientation” or “behaviors or gender expressions,” where a monetary transaction is entailed.

There is no limitation in the bill itself placed on venue (office, private residence, church, conference hall, auditorium, classroom), the mode of communication (lecture, question-and-answer counseling, facilitated small-group discussion, writing), or the number of persons that may be present at a given event.

The Consumer Legal Remedies Act does not limit “unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business practices” to discussions with a single individual. One can just as well engage in such practices in a classroom setting as in a one-on-one session. If Samson had intended the limitations he specifies in his email, why didn’t he advise Low to put them in the bill?

Samson’s comment in the FactCheck.org article, which is repeated in the updated Snopes article, is a masterpiece of dissembling: “The bill by its express terms is limited to the practice of conversion therapy as a commercial service in exchange for monetary compensation.” One who hasn’t read the bill but reads this description would likely conclude that “the practice of conversion therapy” means only the practice of reparative therapy or some other psychotherapeutic practice engaged in by mental health professionals. As we have shown, one would be wrong.

What’s the bottom line? Either Low and Samson are deliberately misrepresenting matters to secure passage of this bill, or they have ignorantly constructed one of the most poorly worded bills imaginable. Whichever answer one goes with, the end result is the same: AB 2943 does not exempt from state action any oral or written communications associated with a monetary transaction that convey, in whole or part, that people should stop engaging in homosexual practice or expressing themselves as a gender at odds with their biological sex established before birth.

To those tempted to accept Low and Samson’s assurance I say: Caveat emptor.

How California’s LGBT Therapy Ban Could Ban Christianity Itself,"Three-quarters of California’s state assembly supported a bill that has striking implications for American citizens’ first freedoms, in that state and nationally. It is ostensibly a ban on gay and transgender “conversion therapy,” but the bill’s vague and sweeping text could affect essentially every institution of every religion that affirms sexual complementarity.

We’re talking churches, schools, religious charities, summer camps — every forum that involves a financial transaction could be banned from allowing any discussion of basic doctrines of sexuality that Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, among others, have held for thousands of years. We’re talking core doctrines of religions adhered to by billions of people being outlawed from discussion in any forum that involves money changing hands, possibly even houses of worship themselves.

I know that sounds outlandish, but that is a plain reading of the bill text. Let’s look at it.

The bill amends the state’s commercial fraud laws as follows:

The following unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices undertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result or that results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer are unlawful:… Advertising, offering to engage in, or engaging in sexual orientation change efforts with an individual. (emphasis added)

So the bill would ban advertising or offering to engage in “sexual orientation change efforts.” The bill defines “Sexual orientation change efforts” as “any practices that seek to change an individual’s sexual orientation. This includes efforts to change behaviors or gender expressions, or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same sex” (emphasis added).

This reads like it could easily ban pastors, rabbis, and imams from preaching or counseling parishioners on same-sex attraction or desires to approximate the opposite sex. It clearly could also apply to a person who is paid to educate, exhort, and counsel parishioners on their faith simply stating what the Bible, Torah, or Koran, together with their respective theological traditions, teaches on human sexuality.

To state that something is authoritatively true and explain why and how, which are inherent functions of religious teaching, is an attempt to persuade people to believe it, and therefore live accordingly. That would apply to stating something like “God made humans male and female,” a direct quote from three different Bible passages (1, 2, 3), including the words of Christ himself.

That contradicts LGBT ideology that men and women are interchangeable. Saying so, presenting an alternative idea, could persuade people to live accordingly. The bill attempts to ban this. Thus, the bill seems to gag religious leaders from stating their own faith’s teachings so long as that leader is compensated for doing so.

I’m not the only one reading it that way. An Alliance Defending Freedom legal analysis gives these examples, among others, of activities the bill would ban:

• A bookstore (including online bookstores like Amazon) could not sell many recently published books challenging gender identity ideology and advocating that these beliefs should be rejected by society; and

• A pastor paid to speak at an event addressing current social topics could not encourage attendees that they can prevail over same-sex desires or feelings that they were born the wrong sex.

“At its core, AB 2943 outlaws speech, whether offered by a licensed counselor, a best-selling author, or even a minister or religious leader,” ADF’s analysis says. The bill’s speech ban is triggered when money changes hands to facilitate the speech, which is why it’s an amendment to the state’s commercial fraud law. “AB 2943 labels such faith-driven activity as fraudulent and deceptive practices, subjecting anyone who engages in them to ruinous lawsuits, punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees,” the analysis says.

Essentially all U.S. clergy who adhere to the orthodox teachings of Islam, Christianity, and Judaism financially “transact” with their congregations to provide services such as preaching, teaching, and counseling. ADF notes the law the bill would modify “specifically commands that it be ‘liberally construed and applied.'” It also includes no religious exemption, which might mitigate some of these effects I’ve described (although it wouldn’t alleviate all). We’re talking essentially outlawing major religions here. Or, at least, forbidding people from practicing or even learning about a significant component of their own faith.

That is of course banning the faith entirely, because religions are a package deal. The entire point of a religion is to offer comprehensive ways of understanding and contextualizing the universe and our place in it. To ban part of it is to ban the whole. It’s like saying “We’re not banning math, only multiplication.” Okay, you aren’t free to do real math without the possibility of using multiplication.

If it would gag pastors, the bill would also gag employees of religious institutions such as schools, summer camps, churches, universities, daycares, hospitals, mental health clinics, conference and retreat centers, and poverty relief organizations. It would gag employees of non-religious institutions whose religion informs their work, as do many employees in foster care, counseling, mental health, education, and other social welfare fields. Any person or organization that takes money for services or goods and expresses an idea — even to willing listeners! — that could be construed as encouraging sexual orientation change would be liable for emotionally and financially devastating lawsuits.

When LGBT activists were pushing for legal recognition of same-sex relationships, they told us, “What we do in the bedroom has nothing to do with you.” We heard a lot about “love” and “tolerance.”

It’s impossible to square those promises with this bill — or disorienting innocent kindergarteners with the idea that boys can turn into girls, or using government force to ruin the private businesses of religious believers for not wanting to participate in acts their deepest beliefs condemn, or insisting HIV-positive people have no legal obligation to disclose that fact when they risk transmitting that disease to non-consenting people, or shutting down organizations that help orphans find homes, or pushing to mutilate minors‘ natural and healthy body parts, or hounding an onscreen prostitute into suicide for not wanting to participate in gay sex.

The LGBT movement keeps telling us they want nothing more than to coexist with the same freedoms we all have. They want “equality.” But it looks like that really means severely curtailing our freedoms into some activists’ view of an extremely limited way of life that precludes deep and old religious understandings of the world. It looks like their version of “equality” means “equally limited, micromanaged, harassed, afraid, and coerced by a narrow, uniform vision of existence controlled by people with big axes to grind.”",https://thefederalist.com/2018/05/04/californias-lgbt-therapy-ban-would-ban-christianity-itself/,2018-05-04
The Numbers Say ‘Being Fired For Being Gay’ Almost Never Happens,"LGBT media regularly cite the number of states where one can be fired “for being gay.” Many have long argued the risk is minimal, as the LGBTQ Caucus confirmed in a recent tweet: “Majority of Americans oppose laws allowing businesses #LicenseToDiscriminate against #LGBTQ people #SmallBusinessWeek”

Yet a great majority of businesses, including 89 percent of Fortune 500 companies, self-police against anti-LGBT discrimination. In 2017, 2,016 LGBT discrimination cases were resolved by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, with 83 percent found to either have had no legitimate basis or closed for lack of evidence. The oldest and largest LGBT legal firm, Lambda Legal, currently has six active discrimination cases and the EEOC reports only 4.3 percent of reported anti-LGBT discrimination claims were found to have “reasonable cause.”

Is there a legitimate concern over this possibility? Reported cases of anti-LGBT discrimination tend to involve teachers. These stories get a great deal of attention because teachers are sympathetic figures. Unfortunately, the LGBT media isn’t always straightforward in their reporting of these kinds of incidents, making an objective evaluation difficult. Lost in the chaos and emotion are situations in which the Right may consider a completely different position if provided accurate information.

Unless the organization is specifically religious, the teachers discussed here did not lose their jobs. For comparison, about 42 percent of women report experiencing workplace discrimination and 59 percent report experiencing unwanted sexual advances at work. Are we fixating too closely on an issue that may be little more than an inevitable outlier to the normal experience of most LGBT Americans?

Let’s consider some recent examples of stories in which the LGBT media narrative did not match the facts available, thus contributing to a false narrative that harms constructive dialogue.

School Renews Contract With Teacher Despite Complaints

In early March the Human Rights Campaign tweeted a story of an openly gay elementary school teacher who had been suspended, stating, “Horrendous: 2016 MISD Teacher of the Year allegedly suspended in the fall for asking Texas school officials to include #LGBTQ identity in non-discrimination policies.”

The teacher, Stacy Bailey, had been advocating for the school’s anti-discrimination policy to include multiple areas of LGBT identity. She also began reaching out to other schools to see if they offered gay-straight alliances for students. She was scheduled to meet the school board regarding her concern when, as the local news reported, the following day she received a letter “notifying her that the district was placing her on administrative leave with pay ‘until an investigation is completed.’”

But that was not the whole story. A BuzzFeed article titled “Texas Teacher Suspended For Being Gay Still Doesn’t Know When She Will Be Back In A Classroom” discusses more details of the events prior to her suspension. Bailey, an elementary art teacher, had discussed her sexual orientation with her students and showed them a picture of her fiancé.

The school described this as part of an “ongoing discussion” about her sexual orientation, the sexuality of artists, and their relationships with other gay artists. Several parents expressed concerns about what they considered age-inappropriate discussion and the teacher was temporarily suspended with pay while the school conducted an investigation.

The school engaged in multiple conversations with Bailey about the nature of her conversations and many parents’ preferences. Bailey “refused to follow administration’s directions regarding age-appropriate conversations with students.” The district said its decision was not connected to her efforts promoting the non-discrimination policy, which was designed to be “all-inclusive.”

The core of the concern was around parents’ right to determine what topics their children are exposed to. Bailey’s contract with the school had already been renewed when BuzzFeed published its story. So not only was Bailey not “fired for being gay,” it’s unclear whether she was put under review for being gay or for spending too much time discussing sexual topics with other people’s children.

Supportive Employer Just Wanted Him to Show Up

In a more extreme story, a gay teacher in Kansas reportedly was forced to resign from his job and move out of state due to anti-gay harassment and threats. As reported by several LGBT news sites, Michael Hill came out on National Coming Out day in October last year. He reported receiving anonymous threats and posted images of several typed letters that included abusive and threatening language.

The Advocate reported the letters included “Queers will burn and so will you” and “We don’t want fags in our schools.” Hill stated he was harassed in his classroom, where he taught drama and art, and even had his tire punctured with a screwdriver and a gay slur written in the dust on his windshield.

All of this was reported to the police, who conducted a full investigation but could not find anything to pursue. As a result, he became exceedingly paranoid, was afraid to leave his apartment, and took seven weeks of unpaid medical leave. The school explained he would need to return to his classroom, or he would have to resign. He chose to resign and move to Palm Springs, California.

The superintendent of the school expressed sorrow that Hill felt he had to leave and stated he was a valuable addition to the school. Since the story broke in mid-April, no updates or further information has been reported.

School Puts Its Full Support Behind Teacher

From the other side of the spectrum, a story from Chicago provides a look into the sensitivity surrounding both sides of the discussion. In this case, an elementary school music teacher received flowers from his husband on Valentine’s Day, and his first-grade students asked him about it.

He told them the flowers came from his husband, and several of the students responded with mocking tones or saying “ew.” The teacher decided it was a good time to discuss tolerance and diversity in families, and a parent expressed concern afterwards to the principal. The principal conveyed the parent’s concerns and asked the teacher to “stick to the curriculum” in the classroom.

For this, teachers unions planned a protest rally at the next school board meeting. The Illinois Education Association sent a press release to all faculty and staff, asking them to support the teacher. The school stated he was never in danger of losing his job and has not been formally reprimanded over the incident.

This Teacher Broke Her Agreement

Finally, a Miami first grade teacher was reportedly fired from her job at a Catholic school after she married her fiancé. A spokeswoman for the Archdiocese of Miami, Mary Ross Agosta, stated the teacher was fired because, “[S]he broke the contract she signed when she began teaching at a Catholic school.” The teaching contract has a morality clause.

Rather than positioning each individual as a victim of anti-LGBT hatred, each situation should be looked at as its own scenario with its own context.

The teacher posted pictures of her wedding to her social media accounts, which sparked the controversy. The school indicated the posting of the pictures associated with her work at the school on a public forum was the violation, rather than the marriage itself. Many parents and students advocated for the teacher, stating her work spoke for itself and she was highly valued in the community.

In all of the above cases, LGBT and other media seem to fail to present all the facts to the audience. Often one must sift through several reports to piece together the information. But lost in the conversation is where the line falls between the religious freedom of a Catholic institution to determine private or public morality of its teachers and a beloved teacher sharing photos of her same-sex wedding on her personal social media. This is a debatable line that should belong to the people involved to determine.

Is it reasonable for a parent to be upset that a teacher revealed he has a husband on Valentine’s Day while receiving a gift of flowers? Would an anti-discrimination law affect this situation, or simply fuel the out-of-proportion outrage expressed by the townhall rally? If the teacher instead had revealed he was Christian and answered a few questions regarding his personal faith, would the response from all parties involved be the same?

It is easy to understand why conservatives hesitate to expand LGBT protection measures given that we see high-profile examples exploiting emotions without providing accurate information. Rather than positioning each individual as a victim of anti-LGBT hatred, each situation should be looked at as its own scenario with its own context. As long as the LGBT media continues exaggerating these situations or reporting on unsubstantiated claims, they cannot be trusted to determine discrimination policy.

7 Key Takeaways From ACLU Spin On Their Masterpiece Cakeshop Loss,"The deceptively named American Civil Liberties Union fought to the Supreme Court to force Colorado baker Jack Phillips to participate in a homosexual celebration or face bankrupting fines and state surveillance of his religious observance and speech. In the wake of Monday’s Masterpiece Cakeshop decision against their clients, Charlie Craig and David Mullins, the ACLU sought to keep influencing the public narrative to keep pressure on the Supreme Court and lower courts for future cases.

Nearly all Americans oppose rude and worse behavior towards gay people, and we should. Yet many also do not like the idea of bankrupting a small business because big money exploited two men’s hurt feelings to push an authoritarian, socially transformative agenda. So let’s consider whether the ACLU’s messaging is true or false, and what purposes deception might serve.

1. The ACLU Smears Phillips As Anti-Gay, But That’s False

Even though Phillips has repeatedly said publicly and in court that he would be happy to serve Craig and Mullins in any way except celebrating their sexuality, the ACLU keeps saying the pair “were refused service at a Colorado bakery because they are a same-sex couple.”

If that were true, Phillips would not be happy to sell them anything he makes except one category of custom item. Phillips says he would also be happy to make a custom cake for a same-sex-attracted man and a woman’s wedding to each other (that sounds weird but is actually common). So this and all the other similar court cases are not about the gay couple being gay, because these artists are perfectly happy to serve gay people.

It’s about this gay couple demanding that Phillips celebrate their sexuality, an act he believes would displease God. Phillips merely is saying his conscience is not for sale. Either the ACLU is lying about this core issue, or this high-status group of lawyers and comms people really cannot sort ideas precisely. Either option is troubling, especially given how bad-faith it is and high-stakes it ought to be to call someone a bigot unless you can prove something that terrible is true.

2. LGBT Lobby Prefers Smears to Good-Faith Engagement

So why would the ACLU prefer to smear Phillips rather than deal with the substance of his arguments, both in courts of law and of public opinion? Perhaps this is an implicit admission that their case rests on projected and subjective ill feeling rather than objective reality. It’s a dangerous thing to attach large penalties to how offended someone gets at your life choices.

This is a case about how we want to weigh the constitutionally guaranteed free exercise of religion against the non-secured, tyrannical desire of some people to force others to act as if same-sex behavior defines a person’s being and has absolutely zero drawbacks or social tradeoffs. Americans certainly have more nuanced beliefs on such questions than the question framing on which they are generally polled: whether it’s okay for a business to refuse to serve gay people “for being gay.”

If ACLU and allies engage with the actual substance of the dispute, however, they have a much harder public argument. This is probably why publicist Lauren Diamond, from the PR firm Berlin Rosen, sent around talking points to press lists soon after the decision Monday, recommending that media smear Phillip’s public interest law firm, Alliance Defending Freedom, rather than accurately report its stance.

“It’s critical that ADF’s real agenda – eroding the rights of LGBT people – is at the forefront of any coverage about today’s ruling,” she wrote. At least one organization’s business model involves monetizing baseless defamation against ADF and other groups. Lying makes the Southern Poverty Law Center so many millions they can afford lots of PR contracts to keep the smears spreading.

Smearing people is indeed critical for pushing a political agenda designed to shut their ideas out of public discourse and profit from ruining people’s reputations. Tactics like these, however, should deeply wound the credibility of those who use them, and make people less likely to trust the other things they say — like “this case is about ‘a license to discriminate against gay people.'”

3. ‘Discrimination’ and ‘Bigotry’ Are Now Weasel Words

It cannot be that the ACLU is against all cases of “discrimination” in businesses open to the public, or they would be fighting to force businesses to accept barefooted and shirtless people. Yet the organization’s employees and allies incessantly repeat “discrimination” as a pejorative throughout what they portray as arguments, without ever explaining why we should consider this kind of discrimination the bad kind.

In discussing the decision with reporters, the ACLU lawyer on the Masterpiece case, James Esseks, characterized what ADF sought as “a license to discriminate under the constitution based on who their customers were.” Several times during the press call, he used the bumper-sticker phrase “a constitutional right to discriminate” to characterize the opposition.

He appears to want people to recoil at the mere concept of making distinctions between two things, but all sane people agree that some discrimination is good while other kinds are not. For example, Roseanne Barr was properly “discriminated against” for publicly hurling a racial slur. In firing her, her employer exercised justifiable discrimination against people who do such things. So the real question at issue in these cake cases is what sort of discrimination society should condone and which it should condemn.

Our society has answered the question of whether it’s acceptable to discriminate based on race, and we did so in blood. We have not yet truly decided whether it’s acceptable to discriminate between men and women in sexual practices and sex-related law. Regardless, Big LGBT seeks to herd everyone preemptively into their desired social structure without the opportunity for informed and broad consent. Not only is that not fair, it endangers their cause. It both risks backlash and implies their cause has something to hide.

Perhaps they think Americans won’t really be on board with their program if we get to see what it is first. Since it involves things like denying abandoned children loving foster homes, that’s probably a reasonable expectation. All the more reason to make sure we get a good look.

4. The Jury Is Out On Analogizing Gay Sex to Race

The ACLU and its allies compare Jack’s beliefs with racial bigotry. They and several Supreme Court justices explored this comparison directly during oral arguments. They are trying to take Americans’ shame and desire to make things right over slavery and Jim Crow and pull it like a blanket over sexuality as well as race.

That is another major argument to have, and many African-Americans find it objectionable if not even offensive, but swiftly sliding the comparison across the table before we all get a good look prevents us from examining it carefully. As I established above, Jack’s objection is to the nature of the event the ACLU sought to force him to participate in, not the identity of the participants. So the comparison to racism doesn’t work there.

It also doesn’t work on the substance of Jack’s beliefs about marriage. There is no such thing as a “black wedding” or a “white wedding.” Those are just weddings. Weddings are not a thing white people do or black people do, they are a thing all people of all times, nationalities, and tribes have done.

Not so demanding that people think an exclusive sexual lifelong relationship between a man and a woman is the same thing as a similar relationship between a man and a man or a woman and a woman. Actually, no society until about the past 50 years has ever tried to say that everyone must be forced into acknowledging that a woman and man are identical, even interchangeable sex partners, since everyone has always considered men and women as very obviously different. Even when ancient Athens and Sparta and others tolerated widespread homosexual relationships, their societies never called it marriage.

The point being, there is indeed a distinction between sex and race. People of different colors and shapes and ethnicities all make children in exactly the same way. There can be no distinction here but in a prejudiced way, in a way that creates a distinction where there really isn’t one. Yet there is really a natural and obvious distinction between having sex with a man and having sex with a woman. Not to put too fine a point on it, but completely different body parts are involved.

Also — and this is extremely important to law and society broadly, because family law and childrearing are major components of any civilization — one type of sex can produce babies, and one type cannot. That is a natural distinction point in a way that race is not. Race and sexuality are not the same, or even analogous.

5. Comparing Support for Natural Marriage to Racism Is an Outrageous Slur

Racism is despised in our society, and should be. People who display racist views are hounded out of jobs, relationships, social media, and more. Recall, for example, the Twitter troll who exhibited anti-Muslim bigotry and was recently outed by HuffPost, then consequently shunned even by her own family. To call someone a racist is a serious charge, because it is a serious moral wrong.

Given that, it is a slur to compare deeply considered Christian, Jewish, and Muslim teachings about natural marriage to racism. In its decision requiring all states to give gay couples marriage licenses, the Supreme Court called religious teachings about the sanctity of man-woman marriage “decent and honorable.” In its Masterpiece decision Monday, the court said “the religious and philosophical objections to gay marriage are protected views and in some instances protected forms of expression,” and that it is “inappropriate” for governments to compare these religious teachings to racism.

Yet the ACLU and the LGBT lobby make this comparison constantly, displaying as little regard for people who think differently as they claim such folks have about gay people.

“Nobody can say we won’t sell X, Y, and Z to gay people, to women, to Latinos, to Muslims, or anybody else,” ACLU lawyer Esseks told media, characterizing his opponents’ arguments. This is not only untrue and bad faith, it is a religious slur. He needs to refrain from that or risk suggesting that his arguments really mean “I want legal protections for gay people that I oppose granting equally to religious people and every other American.”

6. The ACLU Is Making Wild Claims About What’s At Stake…

Esseks and LGBT media characterize issues like those at play in Masterpiece Cakeshop as about “human rights” and “dignity.” Human rights and human dignity are indeed important things. So important that we should apply them precisely so they remain robust concepts.

Let’s be clear here. Seventy percent of Americans think society should accept homosexuality, 89 percent of Americans think gay people should have equal job opportunities, and anti-LGBT violence is extremely rare. American LGBT people are extremely safe and have secure economic prospects. Yes, there are some mean and prejudiced people out there, but largely Americans just want their fellow citizens to be happy. There is no avalanche of anti-gay bigotry just waiting to be unleashed if the Supreme Court lets religious people live in harmony with their most important convictions.

To call that a hardship or to say it threatens someone’s human dignity is, frankly, wildly out of touch with reality.

Now for the Masterpiece case. What’s actually at stake? A handful of gay couples having to buy a wedding product from the second small business owner they consult. That is it. To resolve the Masterpiece case without hauling people to the Supreme Court, the gay couple could literally have simply purchased ready-made items from the same shop or taken their business to one of dozens of other easily accessible artists for hire.

To call that a hardship or to say it threatens someone’s human dignity is, frankly, wildly out of touch with reality. (Just ask anyone who has ever planned any wedding about securing vendors.) If one’s entire identity is called into question by someone saying “I really, really wish I could, and I am so happy to serve you in any other way, but I simply can’t do this one thing,” it says more about the fragility of the party who takes that $100 matter to the freaking Supreme Court than it does the fabricated bigotry of the person they’re suing.

Perhaps to cover for this extremely embarrassing lack of perspective, Esseks told media the Masterpiece case was part of “an intentional campaign of people using claims of free speech to undermine protections for LGBT people, women, and others. This piece is part of that campaign. This case was about cakes, but the overall dispute is about access to health care, education, employment… a hospital saying we will not give you care we give anyone else because of who you are.”

No. It’s not. No hospital will not save a person’s life because he’s LGBT. No public school will fire a gay teacher for being gay. We don’t live in Iran. We live in America, where firemen don’t ask a person what kind of sex he has before hauling the dude out of a burning building, and EMTs don’t ask a person if they’re undocumented before sticking in an IV and billing taxpayers. To imply they might is so silly that a person who makes claims like that ought to be laughed at and ignored as, again, completely non-credible and common-sense impaired.

7. …While Hiding The Real Threat, Which Is Indeed Massive

LGBT people already have intrinsic worth and dignity simply because they are humans. No government can give them dignity or take it away, because their dignity doesn’t come from government. It comes from God. This is what Christians believe.

This belief is the source of the United States’ natural rights-based legal system. That is why freedom of religion is our first freedom. If we don’t have it, we have no basis — legally or rationally — for a free society. Without a creator who fashioned each person in his divine image and endured torture, death, and resurrection to erase every bad thing every person has ever done so he can love them infinitely, there is no philosophical basis for human equality or dignity. If we no longer believe in the self-evident truth “that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,” LGBT activists will find they have unleashed a far greater foe than a handful of Christian cake-bakers who might threaten their access to culinary confections for about 15 minutes.

That foe is the unlimited state, a government so big and so strong that it will tell people what they must believe in the sacred place of their private conscience. A government big enough to give you whatever you think you want from other people is big enough to take away everything you think you have. The power you amass to use against others can just as easily be turned back against you.

Thus, governments allowed unlimited powers have universally turned out to be mass murderers on a inconceivable scale. They offer equality, alright: equality of totalitarian power, applied evenly to those of all varieties of sexual activity. I wish this were exaggeration, but it is not.

"Left Slams Refusal Of Gay Cakes, Celebrates Refusal To Serve Sanders","White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders went to dinner on Friday at a northern Virginia restaurant called the Red Hen. After appetizers were served, restaurant co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson told her the restaurant would not serve Sanders because Wilkinson and many of her employees disagree with Sanders’ politics. Sanders and her party left.

Last night I was told by the owner of Red Hen in Lexington, VA to leave because I work for @POTUS and I politely left. Her actions say far more about her than about me. I always do my best to treat people, including those I disagree with, respectfully and will continue to do so — Kayleigh McEnany 45 Archived (@PressSec45) June 23, 2018

The next day, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) celebrated that action and other recent attacks on Trump administration officials by calling for more aggression against her political opponents. Below she tells a cheering crowd, “If you think we’re gonna get out of here now you ain’t seen nothing yet,” she said. “We have members of [Trump’s] cabinet that have been booed out of restaurants. We have protesters taking up at their house, saying ‘No peace, no sleep, no peace, no sleep.’ And guess what? We’re gonna win this battle because…God is on our side.”

She is calling for more and more aggressive manifestations of what the Left has spent the past five or more years insisting is a civil rights violation, dehumanization, an act of bigotry: for a small business owner to decline to serve someone based on differences of belief. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy said refusing to sell people what they want to buy is an insufferable indignity worthy of adverse legal action. The key difference in the Sanders incident versus attempts to force people to provide products and services for gay celebrations are the so-called identity groups these two fall into: sexual minorities versus a mainstream political affiliation.

Indeed, according to Wilkinson, the difference is on precisely the same topic as the Left’s forced cake-baking campaign. She said the main reason she refused to serve Sanders was the Trump administration’s reluctance to have taxpayers pay for elective transgenderizing surgery and hormones for soldiers.

“This feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals,” Wilkinson told the Washington Post. Who does that sound like? Gracious me, it sounds like small business owners Jack Phillips and florist Baronelle Stutzman, who were hounded within an inch of their life’s savings and ability to appear in public merely for politely declining commissions to participate in gay weddings through their artistic expression.

This Is Worse than What the Cake Bakers Did

There are three big differences between the Christian artists and people like Wilkinson and the many fashion designers who refuse to dress Melania Trump. First, the Christian artists happily serve and sell to LGBT people. Both Phillips and Stutzman explicitly have done and eagerly offer to continue serving those they disagree with. The only thing they will not do is participate in a religious ceremony with them. Every other commercial transaction is on the table. On the contrary, the Trump political opponents who refuse service will not do so in any fashion. It has nothing to do with religion or a particular context or message for them. They refuse to serve the group they disagree with entirely.

Second, the left’s version of these attacks amps up the aggression. Stutzman, Phillips, and those like them spoke the politest declines of a commission they could think of, using terms of respect and love. These activists are frighteningly aggressive: banging drums in people’s faces in private establishments, screaming at them, deliberately being loud enough to attempt to prevent sleep, surrounding their homes with shouted threats and wildly inaccurate, incendiary accusations: “End Texas concentration camps!” “No border, no wall, sanctuary for all!” “How do you sleep at night?” “Do you hear the babies crying?” “If kids don’t eat in peace, you don’t eat in peace.” This sort of behavior is aimed at provoking violence, while the Christian artists sought to bring peace to their differences.

Third, the leftists’ objections are political, while the Christians’ objections are moral. The difference here is that, among Christians their duty to God must trump every other consideration. For these leftists, their politics is their religion. It is what determines what they think is right and wrong. For them, religion and politics are one and the same.

This is yet another unmasking of the truth that mainstream LGBT activists, and the Left in general, are not really about equality, as much as they insist that is so. They are about subversion. They want their preferred identity groups to win, and their opponents’ identity groups to lose. They are not about equal protection under the law, about tolerance, about civility towards people with different ideas. They are about power, about one-upsmanship, about personal destruction.

To them, people who disagree with them are evil, as opposed to merely lacking in information, holding to a different hierarchy of values, or some other such good-faith construction on differences. That’s another exhibition of their political theocracy, because to them politics is not about how to pragmatically solve tangible community needs but about imposing a vision of the ultimate right and wrong, truth and lies, through a power struggle.

For them, politics is a zero-sum game that they want to force anyone who disagrees with them to lose. For those who support the First Amendment freedoms of free exercise of religion, free speech, free expression, and free association, politics is about upholding everyone’s rights equally, even when that means allowing behavior and the expression of ideas we don’t ourselves support.

Here are a litany of tweets by prominent journalists, celebrities, and other Left public figures exhibiting that very dynamic. Many of their viciously partial tweets went viral.

Celebrity keyboardist Benmont Tench III makes the precise point about service refusals that many free association and free exercise of religion supporters have been making about Christians declining to participate in gay ceremonies. It works for the Left when the subject is an opponent, not so much when it’s a leftist tribe member.

A group that styles itself a Trump resistance grassroots organization fails to see that, unlike hard-left LGBT activists, Sanders did not attempt to use government force to get Red Hen to serve her. She simply left as they asked and informed the public about what happened so they can make their own decisions about whether to patronize the Red Hen. That’s all the Christian artists are asking in their own cases, as well: To be free to live as they choose rather than have government force them to disobey God.

If the LGBT lobby had acted as Sanders did, there would have been no social conflict, no bankrupting government fines, and no high-level court cases. The only hypocrisy here is not from Sanders, but from this “resistance” group that cannot see the obvious distinction between government police power and free, noncoercive speech in the public square.

Leftist double standards such as these have especially lately begun to spark recriminations from the Right. Americans haven’t forgotten, for example, that feminists were willing to cover for Bill Clinton when he was accused of rape yet dogpiled Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore for similarly grotesque accusations. The hypocrisy was even worse for presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who was tarred and feathered as anti-woman for expressing a desire to hire qualified women.

The Left appears to want broad license for its own tribe members while applying restrictions and recriminations to the Right. People will only put up with this sort of obvious social injustice for so long. This likely accounts for part of the reason restaurants with the same name as the Virginia one that turned Sanders away are getting flooded with hateful phone calls and comments. Of course that’s wrong, and inexcusable. But it’s also not surprising. Destroy the idea of universal natural rights with identity politics, and it unleashes a roving pack of monsters that currently goes by the name of tribalism.

This dynamic is why extending the protections and treatment you wish for yourself to people you may regard as your worst enemies is an extremely good and needed principle. Call it the social equivalent of the military deterrence effect of mutually assured destruction. Nobody wants where this cycle will end up, so it’s best not to start it in the first place.

This is also why we need to stand down from protecting only our various tribes and people we sympathize with and commit to universal principles that apply to everyone equally. In this situation, those would be the free thought protections enshrined in the First Amendment, which the Left has openly abandoned. It’s best to ensure that all people can freely associate and act out their deepest beliefs, regardless of how popular those beliefs are or from what political quarter they usually find more sympathy. The Left and the Right both need to work on extending to others the courtesy and fairness we’d best like applied to ourselves, for the common good.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/06/25/left-wants-force-christians-sell-gay-couples-celebrates-restaurants-refusal-serve-sarah-sanders/,2018-06-25
I’m A Gay Man. Here’s Why I Don’t Celebrate Pride Month,"The difference between what it means to be a gay person on the Right and a gay person on the Left is becoming far more profound than mere political disagreement. Although there is much discussion about the legitimacy of gay conservatives, we often don’t articulate why we reject our socially assigned community, or how difficult that separation can sometimes be.

To begin, it must be understood that the LGBT movement is, at its core, a progressive movement. The very concept of “gay” rights and activism to force a sexual revolution is the basis of today’s liberalism. Gays did not begin by asking for marriage or to be viewed as everyday citizens; the movement grew from social rejection and intentional counter-culture behaviors and worldviews. Being gay was more than just same-sex attraction, it was a lifestyle of rebellion and creativity.

I am often challenged to answer for generally rejecting LGBT activism with the accusation I am taking for granted what my LGBT ancestors fought for. My life as it is today—married, equal, and normal—is argued to be the direct result of the activism I shun and criticize. At best, I am accused of being ignorant of my history, and at worst I have betrayed my own people while benefiting from their hard work and sacrifice.

Politics Is Not the Same as Culture

Like most gays my age, I have a set of common social experiences, but I am told I am not entitled to enjoy or appreciate them. I grew up with a generation of gay movies, magazines, online chat rooms, musicians and, of course, drag queens. But by rejecting what LGBT is today, I am expected to forfeit all cultural experiences linking me to the gay community.

Much of how society views me is structured around media images of gay men, usually originating from “Will and Grace,” “Ellen,” and RuPaul. My friends, family, coworkers, and those with whom I engage online hold a certain set of expectations for me to happily fulfill as their gay friend. Even though most people treat me as a person first, we agree that I have slightly different social expectations.

I can get away with flirting, joking, and certain mannerisms straight men are not allowed, and many women view me as an equal confidant and girlfriend. None of this is negative, and I happily encourage the social interaction because it is part of how I learned to engage with my world. But outside of this, my sexuality is remarkably minimal in my day-to-day activities. Despite my awareness of my social designation, its really only useful in playful social interaction or politics.

This was the stated goal of the gay movement for more than a decade. However, today’s LGBT movement is far more focused on the smallest variation of identity as an absolute characterization of who a person is. More importantly, the movement tends to treat people based solely on who they are not. The growing intolerance of intellectual diversity and the move towards mandatory class and identity association in all areas of life has restricted what was once a uniquely colorful example of freedom of expression.

Gays Aren’t Fun Any More

Gays aren’t fun any longer. While growing up, I watched the gay world through movies, the Internet, and magazines and imagined an environment of laughter, music, and genuine acceptance. Today I see a movement of exclusion, bitter scolding, humorless lecturing, and a constant state of rhetorical crisis. I witness and experience hate, bigotry, and tangible intolerance typically founded on the flimsiest of assumed beliefs and outdated prejudices. I find myself a caricature of what I used to imagine a Republican to be.

I still find joy in much of the culture. I enjoy the remaining artifacts of an era in which biting social commentary and intentionally offensive humor was celebrated. There is a kind of relief in noticing that some still appreciate counter-culture expression. But for the most part I do not see myself in the parades, protests, or social movements.

I do not experience the discrimination, threats, or social rejection that fuels their advocacy. There is simply nothing for me to march for or against as a gay man. I am repulsed by the realization that absolutely everything the LGBT world produces reflects a singular and vitriolic political flavor I just do not appreciate.

I Don’t Need the Gay Movement to Be Free

When I was in high school, I cherished the rainbow flag because it felt like hope and freedom to me. I instantly lit up whenever I saw it, especially in a public setting, and it resonated with me in a deeply meaningful way. It promised a world of acceptance and normalcy where my dreams as a person superseded my limitations as a gay man.

But I no longer have those limitations. I am free to pursue any dream I wish. My sense of purpose and hope are no longer tied to a flag fluttering proudly in the distance. I no longer need the gay community. I am in a position to choose it.

In a nutshell, that has become our most profound difference. There are gay people who have embraced equality and integrated into daily life exactly as they are, without fear or hesitation, and gay people who still believe they must surround themselves with a rainbow flag. Instead of allowing that flag to represent a culture of color, excitement, and acceptance, the community has become insular, suspicious, and angry.

In the freest time of our history in this country, when a Republican president is un-self-consciously gay-friendly and conservatives open their arms to like-minded gay citizens, the gay Left remains under an umbrella of self-perpetuating fear and doom.

What it means to be gay has changed dramatically. For many of us, it no longer has anything to do with politics. LGBT as a movement, however, is exclusively politics. One cannot participate without being marinated in activism. Perhaps that drive gives many in the movement a sense of purpose and meaning, but it holds no attraction to me.

Whatever advances or accomplishments a generation or so before me won, the movement itself has never stepped up to accept it as a victory. I have just chosen to enjoy my natural freedom with additional possibilities that better suit the life I choose to live.

Who I Am Transcends My Sexuality

During the month of June I do not raise the rainbow flag or celebrate “pride” with my fellow gays. Nothing for me changes outside of an intense awareness of just how silly the whining and cries of outrage are from so many LGBT advocacy groups throughout the rest of the year. As I watch the world sing in celebration of all things LGBT, I smile with the recognition that I just don’t need them to celebrate me in the same way any longer. Despite what mainstream LGBT insists, I genuinely do not need them, and they have not made me a welcome member of their group, solely based on my political worldview.

Pride month no longer holds power or weight in my world precisely because being gay is not the fundamental attribute that defines me.

As the LGBT movement continues to move to the Left and its oppressive characteristics grow in proportion, many people happy in their lives as gay individuals will begin to understand what I and other gay conservatives have realized for a long time. Gays who move outside of the limiting political boundaries of the LGBT movement have to recognize that our personal sense of identity with the culture is ours alone, but it will always be influenced by politics. Our favorite movies, drag queens, LGBT events, festivals, and so on will always be inundated with progressive politics and, unfortunately, intolerance and bigotry.

I am a gay person, and that is simply an aspect of who I am. While I am aware of my social status as a result, most of the time it is nothing more or less than an interesting part of my personal story. Politically I am identical to the majority of other conservatives and libertarians I engage with daily, with just a touch of fabulous wit and style.

More importantly, I am finally a person with a life built by my own choices. Pride month no longer holds power or weight in my world precisely because being gay is not the fundamental attribute that defines me. I hope my experience will one day be common for most gay people to enjoy, and the rainbow flag will be just a reminder of a time in our past when culture was changing, and we had something to celebrate.

3 Years Have Only Proved That Obergefell Was A Big Mistake,"Three years ago, a bare majority on the Supreme Court decreed a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. Like many others, I was on the losing side of that decision. I am not persuaded that it was the wrong side.

Opposition to same-sex marriage is now a minority position, and our cultural elites treat it as beyond the bounds of reasonable discourse. The losers are expected to convert or to shut up, and many have. Younger conservatives may wonder why we fought over this at all. But nothing over the last few years has changed my mind. Indeed, I have become more certain that same-sex marriage is a legal and cultural mistake.

As a matter of constitutional law, the Obergefell decision was indefensible. Justice Anthony Kennedy led the majority in playing philosopher-kings, rather than being judges. They believed that same-sex marriage should be legally recognized, and so they invented a constitutional requirement for it. The cultural and media elites who celebrated the ruling ignored that it was a fundamentally autocratic, anti-democratic decision. But sacrificing the rule of law to the zeitgeist has repercussions beyond the individual case. Those who abandon the rule of law to advance their agenda should not be surprised when others do the same.

The implementation of same-sex marriage has also been marked by bullying and intolerance — from its advocates. They once insisted that same-sex marriage was a live and let live proposition. They are now trying to ruin the careers and businesses of anyone who still objects to it — especially anyone who declines to participate in promoting and celebrating same-sex weddings.

And, immediately following the triumph of the campaign for same-sex marriage, the LGBT movement began to aggressively promote a transgender agenda that encourages alienation and disassociation from the realities of our embodiment. From this, too, dissent will not be tolerated. The LGBT lobby is even outraged by mild cautions from sympathetic observers who have realized that blindly affirming all claims to transgender identity puts some children at risk.

It would have been better if advocates for same-sex marriage had been faithful to the Constitution, committed to the rule of law, tolerant of disagreement and accepting of the realities of human embodiment. It would have been better, but they would still be wrong. Regardless of the good or bad behavior of the LGBT movement, same-marriage is wrong in itself because it fundamentally misunderstands the reality of what marriage is.

The proponents of same-sex marriage are not alone in this. Our entire culture has a crisis of sex, relationships, family and fertility. Same-sex marriage is not responsible for this. Those who identify as LGBT are not responsible for it (much). The guilty parties are mostly ordinary heterosexual men and women who degraded and destroyed their marriages by giving in to selfishness and self-indulgence. Long before same-sex marriage was a mainstream cause, the decline of marriage in America provided plenty of ammunition with which to assail arguments for preserving the “sanctity of marriage.”

And the critics were right. Many Americans, Christians included, had disassociated procreation from marriage, embraced easy divorce, and emphasized romantic self-fulfillment above all else. The effects have harmed, and even devastated, millions. And this has been done by heterosexual men and women, many of who nonetheless self-righteously opposed same-sex marriage.

But though same-sex marriage is not responsible for the crisis of marriage and family, it will make it harder to reverse. Just as cultural shifts in the understanding of marriage made same-sex marriage thinkable, so same-sex marriage will make unthinkable the deeper understandings of marriage that are rooted in the natural complementarity and fecundity of men and women. Marriage is a union of the two halves of the human race, directed to the propagation of the human species and to lifelong companionship and support.

The highest expressions of this traditional view of marriage unite love, companionship, partnership, procreation and family. Religions draw on this central human relationship to represent the relationship between man and the divine. The Jewish scriptures repeatedly analogize the relationship between God and His people to a marriage. For Christians, marriage presents an image of the union of Christ and the Church.

Such views are now denounced as bigotry. We are told not to think in heteronormative terms, but marriage is heteronormative by nature. The place of marriage in human culture and civilization only makes sense in heteronormative terms. It is the formation of a new family, not just the recognition of a couple’s romantic love. Treating marriage as mere legal recognition of a current romantic partnership (that can be voluntarily dissolved at any time, for any reason) is as much a decline from the full meaning of marriage as treating it as a mere economic or political arrangement. Marriage incorporates many aspects of human flourishing, and excising some of them (such as procreation and the complementarity of the sexes) is harmful to it.

Consequently, accepting same-sex marriage precludes thinking clearly about what marriage is. If same-sex marriage is legitimized, then marriage is necessarily disassociated from the union of the two halves of the human race and the propagation of the species. This view asserts that men and women are interchangeable, rather than complementary, and it separates marriage from children and the natural family as a matter of definition, rather than of accident.

The fullness of marriage is only realizable between a man and a woman in a union that is naturally open to children. That some heterosexual couples, whether from age or from misfortune, are unable to have children does not alter this. Infertility is a deprivation that should be mourned as a diminishment of a marriage’s full potential. But the intrinsic sterility of same-sex relationships makes what is otherwise an unfortunate accident (or sometimes a deliberate diminishment) into an essential characteristic of a marriage. And same-sex relationships also exclude the union of the two halves of the human race that marriage provides. Legal recognition of same-sex marriage codifies the falsehood that men and women are essentially interchangeable.

It has become culturally forbidden to believe that men and women are essentially different — with limited exceptions. We are told to simultaneously believe that men and women are not essentially different, and that it is imperative to accommodate claims of sexual orientation and gender identity — which presume that men and women are not interchangeable.

For those advancing these seemingly contradictory claims, the differences are merely of sexual orientation (what sort of body turns you on?) or of a “gender identity” that is separate from, and may supersede, one’s embodiment as male or female. Thus, although the case for same-sex marriage rested upon the difference between men and women, this difference was treated not as intrinsic or essential, but as a matter of individual preference — the sovereign inclination and self-created identity of the individual.

We cannot think clearly about relations between men and women, if we believe that men and women are interchangeable, except as regards our sexual predilections or subjective identities. We cannot think clearly about fathers, mothers, sons and daughters if we pretend that there are no differences between them, or that “two dads” or “two moms” are interchangeable with a mother and father.

We are in a crisis of marriage and family. Much of our political and cultural dysfunction is the fallout of broken families and failed relationships — abandoned children and lonely, hurt men and women. Again, this was not caused by same-sex marriage or the LGBT movement, but accepting their ideological framework will impede amelioration. The healing truths that our culture needs are incompatible with an ideology that muddles the differences between men and women, and that rejects the unique value of the natural family.

The sexual revolution promised more than it could deliver, but our culture is still dominated by those who believe that the next hit of sexual liberation will finally bring happiness. Amidst these continued failures, who will provide the social capital to eventually build up what has been destroyed?

It will be those on the losing side. It will be ordinary men and women who believe in and live by a full understanding of marriage, no matter how unpopular such beliefs become.

"Evangelicals To Discuss ‘Queer Treasure, Honor, And Glory’ In Heaven","A movement to endorse gay identity has sparked controversy among one of the country’s last remaining influential conservative Protestant denominations.

These believers are discussing homosexual desires and whether it’s okay to call oneself gay or queer as long as you regard gay sex as sinful. Approving same-sex relationships is off the table—at least for now. But plenty of congregation members worry the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) could eventually go the way of mainline denominations and approve gay sex and other behaviors along the LGBT spectrum.

Formed in the early 1970s, the conservative PCA is quite distinct from the liberal mainline Presbyterian Church (USA), but in recent years has seen growing contention between conservatives and progressives on a range of issues. The debate in the PCA about gay identity isn’t new, but is now in conflict because of a conference set to be held at a PCA church in St. Louis, Missouri, at the end of July.

Called Revoice, the conference is billed as a forum for “supporting, encouraging, and empowering gay, lesbian, same-sex-attracted, and other LGBT Christians so they can flourish while observing the historical, Christian doctrine of marriage and sexuality.” Because keynote speakers and presenters come not only from the PCA, but also from other Christian groups, the conference has attracted attention far beyond denominational circles.

Queering the Church? How About Churching the Queer

More evangelicals are leaning toward fully embracing homosexuality, including same-sex relationships. Even within the PCA, 49 percent of members say homosexuality should be accepted and 40 percent say they are in favor of same-sex marriage, according to the Pew Research Center. However, denominational leaders in mid-June took steps to shore up commitment to traditional marriage in their Book of Church Order.

The Revoice conference website is soaked in secular LGBT language, including talk of “sexual minorities,” “homophobia,” and “straight allies.” A description of a workshop called “Redeeming Queer Culture: An Adventure” says:

Christians have often discarded the virtues of queer culture along with the vices, which leaves culturally connected Christian sexual minorities torn between two cultures, two histories, and two communities. So questions that have until now been largely unanswered remain: what does queer culture (and specifically, queer literature and theory) have to offer us who follow Christ? What queer treasure, honor, and glory will be brought into the New Jerusalem at the end of time?

A workshop titled “How To Be A Straight Ally” will include discussion on “learning how to own the weight of the straight white evangelical tradition and its sins against gender and sexual minorities.” Other workshops focus on coming out as gay and celibacy, which many associated with Revoice promote over efforts to change one’s desires and marry someone of the opposite sex. They consider the latter unrealistic, while others believe real change is possible. Another workshop will include discussion on “equipping and empowering sexual minorities for their own ministries and callings in the Church and world.”

Karen Swallow Prior, an English professor at the influential evangelical Liberty University and a research fellow with the Southern Baptist Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission (ERLC), is among those defending Revoice, describing it as a movement “calling the church community to come round those with these struggles to help and support them to live biblically.”

But critics say identifying as gay encourages Christians to identify with sin, undermining biblical exhortations to leave the old life completely behind, such as found in 1 Corinthians 6:11: “And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of God.”

Let’s Celebrate Homosexual Desire?

While they say they’re committed to not having gay sex, some Revoice leaders argue there are good things about homosexual desire itself, such as bestowing a greater capacity for friendship and for appreciating beauty. That belief has raised alarms that Revoice proponents with same-sex attraction see themselves as part of the larger gay community to a degree that throws whole-hearted commitment to Christian orthodoxy on sex and marriage into question.

Eve Tushnet, a Catholic lesbian writer known for upholding orthodox doctrine about sexuality, will be a keynote speaker at Revoice. Gregory Coles, the worship leader for Revoice, writes in his book “Single, Gay, Christian” about attending a Christian LGBT event at which he became so awed by the worship experience that he stopped caring what those around him believed. He writes, “God would not be thwarted – not by our wrong answers, not even by our unrepentance or disbelief. Whether the twelve people gathered in that tiny chapel chose to receive God’s grace or to reject it, we could never diminish it.”

Conservatives in the PCA and elsewhere think a debate over fully endorsing homosexual behavior is likely inevitable for a growing number of conservative churches despite efforts to prevent that day from coming. They’ve noted that accepting homosexuality as a fixed orientation and embracing LGBT terminology are steps others have taken before arriving at full approval.

They don’t have far to look to see how this trajectory keeps playing out. Former Wheaton College staffer Julie Rodgers, once a champion of gay celibacy, is now engaged to a woman. Revoice supporters will have to make sound scriptural arguments for why Revoice is not simply lower on a slippery slope towards renouncing Christianity. Their perception is frequently bolstered by experience within Christian denominations.

For example, in April the Southern Province Synod of the Moravian Church approved allowing gay and lesbian ministers to marry. “We have not had restrictions about gay and lesbian members being ordained,” the Rev. David Guthrie told the Winston-Salem Journal. “Prior to this decision, they would have been expected to be single and celibate. This Synod’s decision would allow them, along with all members, to be married.”

Facebook Shuts Down Christian Ideas While Letting Others Post Threats,"Facebook has become one of the great censors of our day. Rather than provide a forum in which people can express their own views freely on controversial issues (controversial, that is, from a left-wing perspective), Facebook administrators have seen fit to selectively impose their radical sexual ethics on users of their social media site.

On June 14 at 1:09 PM I learned that Facebook blocked me for 24 hours because of my alleged “hate speech.” They made my post visible only to my eyes and fixed things so that I could not post or comment on my own FB page or even send communications through private FB messaging. I was directed to the “community standards” that prohibited “a direct attack on people based on what we call protected characteristics — . . . sexual orientation . . . gender identity.”

They said: “If you request a review, someone from our review team will take another look at the post.” There was a little dot to click but no place to make my case, just as there was no specific explanation for why my remarks were being treated as “hate speech.” I clicked the dot and was informed, “Someone will be taking another look at this video.”

I found out that the next time I am blocked it will be for three days; after that, 30 days; with the eventual threat of disabling my Facebook account entirely. What heinous act of “hate speech” did I commit?

I had responded to this perverse video from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation from the program “CBC Life.” In it Canadian television personality Jessi Cruikshank sits at a table with a garland of rainbow balloons, providing lead-in questions to two girls and two boys, who seem to be ages five to eight. The purpose of the video is simple: to proselytize for support of “Gay Pride Month.”

It’s Awesome to Talk to Other People’s Kids about Sex?

Cruikshank started by proclaiming, “Happy pride, everybody!” and asked, “Who knows what ‘gay pride’ means?” After getting an answer she gushed with glee: “It’s a celebration of sexual diversity!” Then she enlisted them in the “LGBTQ” cause by telling them: “So I’m not gay, but I’m a gay ally.” As an authority figure, she coaxed them to join her, asking, “Are you gay allies?” Subtext: You better be, if you know what is good for you.

Not being entirely corrupted at such a tender age, one girl thought that Cruikshank was referring to the game of Hide and Go Seek (bless her innocent heart) when asked, “What does it mean to come out of the closet?” Cruikshank pressed on: “What do you think about gay marriage?” “Do you think it would be cool to have two moms?” “What would it be like to have two dads?” Cruikshank worked to foster a view of “advantages” to same-sex parents.

Cruikshank launched into a litany of “gay celebrities” or “gay icons,” most of whom the children did not know. When a girl asked who Jodie Foster is, Cruikshank outdid even herself: “Jody Foster is a woman and she made me question my sexuality when I was a child because I liked her so much. And she was nude in a film ‘Nell,’ not that I remember watching several times as a child.”

How creepy is that? One of the two little girls answered with an awkward “Wow,” accompanied by an eyeroll, as if to say, “I didn’t need to hear that.” She didn’t. Cruikshank then summed up for the children: “Remember: What are we to the gay community?” She was expecting to hear “gay allies,” but some in their confusion responded, “Gay icons.” To this Cruikshank added: “Everybody should grow up and aspire to be a gay icon.”

Throughout the presentation, Cruikshank fulfilled the Orwellian role of reinforcing “correct” responses with: “Great answer!” “Makes sense.” “Right!” There was one and only one right response to the presentation: Complete, unequivocal agreement with “LGBTQ” ideology.

These young children had obviously been prepped in advance to affirm homosexual and transsexual behavior. Imagine what would have happened to young children who expressed a different view. Undoubtedly, they would have been shamed.

Children at this age are not obsessing about sexuality, nor should they. Yet the “LGBTQ” movement generally feels a need to have them obsess over such things because it is more important for them to win “converts” than to guard the hearts and minds of young children.

So Here’s the Post That Landed Me in Facebook Jail

My posting on this video was straightforward:

This clip is about celebrating sexual perversity, not ‘sexual diversity.’ Brought to you by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the Canadian equivalent to our PBS, paid for by tax dollars. No indoctrination or recruitment going on here (or on PBS), right? Any resemblance to Orwell’s Big Brother (or Kim Jong-un) is purely coincidental? It is a measure of how corrupt things have become that this woman is not vilified throughout Canada and legislators are not threatening to remove funding from the CBC. By the end the woman is talking to little children about Jody Foster helping her to question her own sexuality as a child and about Foster’s nudity in a film.

I consider my post a reasonable response to corrupt indoctrination of children. It is certainly a stance in line with my religious beliefs. Associating “sexual perversity” with “sexual diversity” is consistent with the Christian stance on homosexual practice as “abhorrent” and intrinsically self-“dishonoring” activity (Leviticus 18:22; 20:13; Romans 1:24-27).

It was also consistent with Cruikshank’s efforts at both sexualizing the thoughts of young children and even hinting that they should question their own sexual identity. It was also consistent with Christian rejection of “pride” as a virtue.

Finally, my comments fit the fact that trumpeting “sexual diversity” emphasizes sexual differences, which for consistency’s sake would have to include (minimally) other sexually “diverse” behaviors, including adult-committed forms of polyamory and incest. If one is going to celebrate “sexual diversity,” there is no sense in limiting oneself to homosexual unions and transgenderism.

This is particularly so since the biblical prohibition of incest and the New Testament prohibition on polygamy can be derived from the definition of marriage as the union of two sexual complements. If one’s object is to celebrate “sexual diversity,” then vive la difference!

Facebook Administrators Belatedly Acknowledge Error

Facebook violated its own community standards by attacking my “protected characteristic” of “religious affiliation”: treating a central belief and practice of historic Christian faith as “hate speech.” Facebook members can say virtually anything about Christians who uphold a male-female foundation for sexual ethics, without fear of “Facebook jail.” But I can’t do the same thing from my own religious perspective.

With only 22 minutes left on my FB sentence, on June 15 at 12:47 PM, I received another email from Facebook: “We’re sorry we got this wrong. We reviewed your video again and it does follow our Community Standards. We appreciate you taking the time to request a review. Your feedback helps us do better.”

I suspect my high visibility helped, as did the fact that friends with high visibility posted on Facebook about my ban. However, whether it is that, a product of targeted complaints by LGBTQ zealots, or biased algorithm, we must all band together when these things happen and give Facebook administrators all the bad press that they deserve. Inasmuch as Facebook administrators isolate and punish conservatives in darkness, their deeds need to be exposed to the light of public scrutiny.

My Story Is Not Isolated

Mine is by no means an isolated occurrence of Facebook allowing highly sexualized and politicized images and discussions to flourish when they support leftist ideology and disallowing them when they contradict leftist ideology, even if it means discriminating against religious beliefs. A number of Facebook friends have been victimized by the heavy left hand of Facebook censorship.

A West Virginia pastor, Rich Penkoski, has had his Warriors for Christ FB page (with its 225,000 followers) shut down for a year or so because he said, “If you are a homosexual, statistically speaking, you are more likely to be a pedophile” (go here, here, and here). He says he has been routinely harassed and threatened by LGBTQ activists on Facebook but FB administrators have done nothing.

On December 10, 2017 Brazilian blogger Julio Severo received a 30-day FB suspension for writing in Portuguese: “As Christians, we should love homosexuals, murderers, rapists, pedophiles and all the other sinners. Only Jesus’s love can do it in us.” According to Facebook administrators, this comment fell (absurdly) under one of the following forbidden categories: “offers of sexual services, solicitation of sexual materials, threats or depictions of sexual violence, threats to share intimate images or any sexual content involving minors.”

Kaeley Triller Haver received a seven-day suspension on her professional FB account for posting a picture of a synagogue restroom privacy sign.

In late April 2018, Peter Labarbera of Americans for Truth and a writer for the Christian Post received a 24-hour suspension for “hate speech” because he suggested that the expression “openly gay” be changed to “openly immoral,” in connection with Cynthia Nixon, a candidate for governor of New York who had called her lesbianism a choice (also linked to his Americans for Truth website).

When he next posted a picture of the suspension with a comment about its injustice, he was hit with a three-day suspension. Because I shared a picture of his first suspension on my personal FB page on April 27, I was given a warning and the post was removed.

On May 13, Jason Salamone received a 30-day suspension for “hate speech” because he disputed on Facebook the claim that a “nice person” who engages in homosexual behavior validates the behavior by virtue of being nice. His point was merely that “nice people can often do bad things.”

He added: “Did it ever occur to people that the reason why people caught up in homosexual practice seem very ‘cultured,’ articulate, artistic, meticulous, etc is that they are trying to overcompensate or ‘make up for’ the very unhealthy and unsanitary sex acts they engage in?”

Another FB friend, Jeanette Tyr Runyon, has received numerous suspensions. She received 30-day suspensions for a series of FB posts, including posting a picture with the words “Marriage =” and stick figures of a man and woman, and posting the words “Weston is a woman who thinks she is a man.” She notes that a FB comment on her site by a certain “Don Gardner” did not result in a suspension: “The sooner all you bigots are in concentration camps the sooner real Americans will be able to sleep Safely at night.”

Kaeley Triller Haver received a seven-day suspension on her professional FB account for posting a picture of a synagogue restroom privacy sign that read: “We sympathize with those experiencing a gender identity crisis. But please understand that in order to establish a safe environment in the synagogue in line with Torah values, only biological females (from birth) are permitted to use this restroom.”

Kaeley added the brief caption: “This should be interesting.” She also reports here on how Facebook administrators, in response to expletive-laden and threatening comments by trans-activists on her site devoted to the case against male access to female restrooms, did not think such vile comments violated FB “Community Standards.” Rather, FB administrators shut down her site when she compiled these comments to demonstrate how badly trans-activists behave.

Facebook Needs To Stop Censoring One Side

Facebook’s action against me was a shot across the bow. Because of oppression emanating from “LGBTQ” and “abortion rights” activists, the window of free speech on social media is closing fast. We must act while we still have a voice.

Last April Sen. Ted Cruz was right to point to “a pervasive pattern of bias and political censorship” on the part of Facebook censors. To this can be added a bias against Christian sexual ethics. It appears as if Facebook administrators have learned nothing since this Senate hearing.

As a dominant social media platform Facebook is becoming something like a public trust. Protections should be put in place guaranteeing free speech against one-sided, left-wing Facebook censorship. Alternatively, Christians should take their business elsewhere.

Freedom For Gay People Shouldn’t Mean Stripping Rights From Christians,"Last week, Canada’s Supreme Court told my alma mater, Trinity Western University, that it could not open a law school, because it adheres to Christian teachings about human sexuality. The nation’s top Christian liberal arts school requires students and faculty to affirm they will reserve intercourse exclusively for marriage to someone of the opposite sex.

Accreditation institutions refused to accredit the university’s law school due to its adherence to Christian teachings, and the court upheld their refusal. It is worth noting that LGBTQ people who graduated from Trinity Western have spoken publically and positively about their education at the school.

Trinity Western’s is only the most recent in a string of cases, in both the United States and Canada, highlighting the tension between two important competing goods: preventing discrimination (Trinity’s Community Covenant disallows sexual intimacy outside of marriage, not dissimilar from that of the United States’ Wheaton College or Brigham Young University) and protecting religious freedom.

This tension is difficult to resolve because neither of these interests can be casually dismissed. Banning graduates of Trinity Western’s law school from entry into the legal profession was undoubtedly motivated by an important interest: protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination. But members of the Trinity Western community also have an important interest in freely exercising their religious beliefs.

Because these interests are so important, it is imperative that judges approach these cases with humility and respect for both sides. Unfortunately, that did not happen here. The court’s five-judge majority opinion acknowledged that Trinity Western’s “freedom of conscience and religion” was burdened by demands it compromise its religion to obtain accreditation, but it concluded that this burden was “of minor significance.” Why? Because the Community Covenant was “not absolutely required for the religious practice at issue.”

With this statement, the court presumed to tell Trinity Western what is and is not integral to the practice of their faith. This is a worrisome development for anyone committed to religious liberty, regardless of what one thinks of the ultimate merits of Trinity Western’s claim. When judges assume the power to dismiss certain religious practices as “unimportant,” believers of all stripes are left to wonder whether their practices will someday be brushed off as mere ancillary rituals.

In America, the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act explicitly excludes the centrality of religious beliefs from judicial inspection. As the U.S. Supreme Court explained in Hobby Lobby v. Burwell: “it is not for us to say that their religious beliefs are mistaken or insubstantial.”

This contrast underscores Americans’ and Canadians’ different views of individual rights and government power. I was born in the United States but grew up in Canada, and Canadians tend to more readily accept government involvement in their lives. The two countries’ founding documents exemplify this dissimilarity. While America’s founders undertook a violent revolution to secure natural rights to “life, liberty and pursuit of happiness,” the stated purpose of Canada’s constitution is to preserve “peace, order and good government.”

Politics in a democracy is always partially about competing goods—here, religious freedom and freedom from discrimination. In previous decisions related to TWU, Canada’s Supreme Court carefully sought to balance these goods. But not this time.

As we learned last month when Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked to leave a restaurant, people on both sides of the political spectrum desire to exercise associational liberties. This is a strength of our society, as long as it’s not misused. As religious liberties scholar Vincent Muñoz recently noted about the free association with friends or business relationships,

[O]nce people believe that individuals will use their freedom badly — that they will refuse to associate with others for irrational and bigoted reasons — the commitment to freedom of association begins to evaporate. Very few will remain partisans of liberty when it produces widespread injustice in practice. A free people must be a moral people to exercise and maintain their freedom.

Whether we are in Canada or in the Land of Opportunity, politics in a democracy is always partially about balancing competing goods. Beyond citizens themselves, it is the role of both courts and lawmakers to balance these goods.

Living in a pluralistic society requires limiting the ways government can act. If these constitutional limits are to mean anything, they must mean that the government—including judges—cannot be the arbiter of the theological importance of people’s beliefs.

People Don’t Care About Chick-Fil-A’s Politics If They Make Great Chicken,"This June it looked like Noah crashed into Manhattan and every big box store decided to shower his ark with congratulatory rainbows. Pride coated Fifth Avenue.

Kenneth Cole sold rainbow-striped shoes: “tied with pride.” Gap dressed up its mannequins in shirts that read “WE ARE ONE” in rainbow letters. Perhaps in a game of mannequin one-upmanship, Tommy Hilfiger brightened up same-sex mannequin couples in their summer catalogue.

But at the Chick-fil-A a few blocks down and one street over — on the corner of Sixth Avenue and 46th Street — it looked like pride’s shimmery finger missed a spot.

That’s no surprise. Chick-fil-A has ignored the movement since company president Dan Cathy came out of the closet about his same-sex marriage opposition in 2012. As an entity, however, Chick-fil-A doesn’t take a public stance on LGBTQ issues. It hawks chicken — and that’s why people keep going.

But you’d never know it from looking online. The company took a shellacking when Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey posted that he had just eaten at the restaurant. Pride lovers everywhere drummed Dorsey for his philistine insensitivity: Since Chick-fil-A doesn’t celebrate gay rights, it should be shamed, they said.

The most extreme statement came from Noah Michelson at The Huffington Post, who decreed, “If you care about queer people ― or you yourself are queer ― you have absolutely no business eating at Chick-fil-A. Ever. It’s really that straightforward.” Well, not really.

The other day, I went in to get a milkshake. It was so crowded with people hauling their bags from places like Tommy Hilfiger and GAP on Fifth that I couldn’t sit down. It’s always that way. So I walked half a block down to a shady plaza where I could drink in peace.

Chick-fil-A cups and bags overflowed from the trash cans set up in the plaza: leftovers from the lunch hour. At the end of the workday, a family ate their fried chicken meal about 10 tables over from me.

Several minutes later, two women laden with chicken sandwiches, fries, and shakes walked into the plaza. A bit jealous that they had the full meal while I was stuck with a paltry milkshake, I struck up a conversation. They introduced themselves as Kathy and Merlinda, Chick-fil-A newcomers. They only started eating there when they heard about the restaurant from their friends this month.

I asked if they know that Chick-fil-A doesn’t celebrate the pride movement.

“Well, yeah,” Kathy said. “But I say whatever.”

Merlinda picked up her sandwich.

“They make good chicken and they have great customer service,” she said.

I asked about the recent LGBTQ criticisms in the media.

“Yeah, I think that’s just people being overly sensitive,” Merlinda said.

As I walked away from the plaza in a vain attempt to find an unstuffed trash can for my now-empty milkshake, I passed Chick-fil-A again: still packed.

Chick-fil-A critics — Michelson and so many like him — misunderstand how pride relates to corporate endorsements (or non-endorsements, in Chick-fil-A’s case). The rainbow logos at Starbucks and special Pride Month deals at GAP have little to do with “caring about queer people.” They’re about making money. Corporate Pride succeeds because it adopts a popular cause, slaps it on some T-shirts in a Bangladeshi sweatshop, and sells them at deluxe-edition prices to the suckers on the street.

But forcing people to swear allegiance to an ideology based their shopping habits flattens out the cause’s original meaning into a lame slogan millions of eyes slide past every day. Pride meant something in 2015, when for a moment, the nation really cared about whether LGBTQ people needed marriage to live dignified lives.

Obergefell v. Hodges was an interesting and legally misguided investigation, and it didn’t provide a full answer. The displays on Fifth Avenue don’t give one either; they trivialize the issue into banality.

That’s the great irony of Corporate Pride. By monetizing the serious question of treating LGBTQ people with respect, corporations have put consumers in a tough position. When faced with the choice of ideological shopping or buying consumer products simply for personal satisfaction, most people choose the latter.

Chick-fil-A doesn’t care about fads. Its continued popularity proves that — in this case — consumer desire for satisfaction is stronger than trendy ideology. The company may not be very cool on Twitter, but it will succeed as long as it keeps making good fried chicken. It’s really that straightforward.

Lesbians Targeted For Objecting To Transgenderism At London Pride,"This article quotes obscenities and mentions human genitalia.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan condemned an “anti-transgender group” for “hijacking” the July 7 London Pride parade. The mayor’s spokesperson told Pink News UK, “Pride is about celebrating difference and London’s amazing LGBT+ community. It’s about showing those round the world that in our great city you can be free to be whoever you want to be and love whoever you want to love. The vast majority of those present at today’s march respected and embraced that and the Mayor condemns the tiny minority who did not. Transphobia is never acceptable.”

The “anti-transgender” group was actually a group of lesbian women. The group, organized under the hashtag #GetTheLOut, joined the parade with banners saying “Lesbian, not Queer,” “Lesbian = Female Homosexual,” and “Transactivism Erases Lesbians.”

The group was not included in those allowed to march in the parade, but after being told to leave, they laid down on the street in front of the parade, preventing it from moving forward. The organizers decided to allow them to march ahead of the parade, which created additional controversy for appearing to “lead” it.

LGBT+ Lib Dems Chair Jennie Rigg called for the organizers to resign and provide a full, public apology. Others called for the group members to be arrested under hate crime charges. UK morning radio host Alex Duffy tweeted, “Definitely sounds like they were directing hate against a group based on sexual identity and therefore a hate crime and surely they will now all be arrested and charged?”

Transgender Activists Went Apoplectic

While LGBT media and advocates universally denounced the group, transwomen (biological males) were the most vocal. Trans activist Avery Edison demanded “I used to say ‘No cops at Pride!’, but after seeing the way they removed the TERFs [a rude word to describe feminists who object to transgenderism] who hijacked the parade today–[holds hand to earpiece]–ah, wait, no, it turns out they didn’t do that, they just let them carry on and spread transphobia. No cops at Pride. No TERFs either.”

Riley J. Dennis, a male who self-describes as a “queer, trans, nonbinary, polyamorous lesbian,” in a profanity-laced rant also demanded to know why the group was not kicked out. Laura Kate Dale, the news editor at a gaming website, tweeted, “London Pride this year, first group to pass was TERFs with a ‘transactivism erases lesbians’ banner. Almost got in trouble with police shouting at them to f-ck off. Pride is a riot, and I won’t stand quietly while I’m told I’m not welcome at pride as a trans lesbian” (obscenity altered).

One member of the group, Jan Williams, argued in defense of the demonstration, saying, “Transgenderism is conversion therapy. Conversion therapy is wrong.” Williams continued, “Only women can be lesbians. A man who has surgery can never be a lesbian.” Sarah Mason, who founded the organization Get The L Out, a collaboration of many lesbian-centered groups, said in an interview with Gay Star News, “her sexuality is seen as transphobic and exclusive ‘just because we are women attracted to women.’ ‘We don’t want any kind of penis in our bedroom,’ she said. ‘I’m really sad I have to reassert this again.’”

Dichotomy: Sexuality As Fixed Versus Fluid

The incident demonstrates a long-standing feud between what it means to be gay and what it means to be transgender. The lesbian group’s argument reflects the more established view of sexual orientation as a set attribute of a person who cannot change through behaviors.

Especially as heterosexual men transitioning into lesbian women and homosexual men transitioning into heterosexual women, transactivism challenges this notion by asserting that gender-based attraction is fluid. Many gay people, myself included, view transgender transition as a form of conversion therapy in which a homosexual person’s body is manipulated to better suit a preferred straight sexual orientation.

For many lesbians, the opposite is just as frustrating. When a heterosexual man identifies as a woman, he often expects to fully enter the lesbian world and be embraced, even if he is still physically male. Many lesbians view this as a demand for them to engage in sex with a man under social pressure.

Zinnia Jones, a trans activist, has argued that straight men should overcome their aversion to transwomen who are physically male. Jones’s argument, as detailed in a Twitter thread, begins by saying, “We need to resist this push to misgender trans women using very specifically chosen definitions and applications of ‘biological’ and ‘male.’”

The thread goes on to illustrate that referring to a penis as “male genitalia” effectively gives permission to view transwomen as partially or wholly male. This, Jones argues, invites violence and stigma. In an article for Cosmopolitan about gender reassignment surgery, a 22-year-old transwoman stated, “I want people to know is that it’s normal to want a vagina and to get one, but there’s also a problematic stereotype that trans women aren’t ‘real’ women until we have surgery, and we are. I’ve always been a real woman.”

Many lesbians simply do not agree with this assertion, and like their straight male counterparts, are uncomfortable accepting transwomen as “real” women. Many object to the notion that a person can simply “get a vagina” and understand what it is to be a woman. The mayor of London’s statement should respect this as “you can be free to be whoever you want to be and love whoever you want to love.”

We Pick Our Identity, But You Can’t Pick Your Attraction

A woman who is attracted to women should be free to determine what “woman” means to her. By the current standards of gender fluidity and self-identity, this should not be controversial. But what we are seeing is a demand for freedom of identity, but not freedom of attraction. Transactivists say people can choose to be whatever gender or orientation suits themselves, but no one else is allowed to reject them as a potential sexual or romantic partner.

While the efforts of lesbian groups to hold onto the culture they fought to build for several decades may be an uphill battle, transactivists should recognize that bullying does not win respect or empathy. Rather than approach gays where they are, they have instead chosen to rewrite what it means to be gay, or LGBT, and declared that anyone who disagrees is no longer accepted in the identity group.

The rest of LGBT is far too lost in the mass hysteria of transactivism to understand they are building the bridges they will one day be forced to cross over in exile. Lesbians and feminists have already been marked with the label “TERF.” That stands for Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist and has become a slur used to dismiss all feminist views hostile to transactivist demands.

This should also be instructive to conservatives watching from a distance to understand transactivism’s current mentality and aggressiveness. If this is how they turn on members of their own community who question ever-changing orthodoxy, how can we ever hope to engage them in civil and reasonable debate?

More importantly, we must be aware of how the non-LGBT world responds to events like this, as it demonstrates the power transactivists currently have over many established organizations. A small fraction of the already tiny but powerful LGBT community is dictating everything it means to be LGBT, inside and out, and they are hostile, intolerant, and aggressive.

If lesbians marching in an LGBT Pride parade can be viewed as a dangerous threat requiring denunciation from authorities, what chance is there to have an honest conversation from the conservative world on this topic? It has now become an act of rebellion and dissent to assert that a person’s sexual orientation is his or her own. This affects all of us, regardless of how we identify.

Trans Claims Of Medical Discrimination Are About Refusals To Mutilate,"For some time, the LGBT Left have insisted that various elective procedures and medications to help transgender people approximate the opposite sex are “medically necessary treatments.” Their passion has been fueled by the threat that the Trump administration is preparing to enforce existing law that allows physicians and hospitals to discriminate against transgender people on religious grounds.

The Affordable Health Care Act banned discrimination based on sex, as well as other standard characteristics, in any health program. As The New York Times states, “Under the existing rule, health insurers cannot place arbitrary limits or restrictions on health services that help a person transition from one gender to another. These services may include counseling, psychotherapy, hormone therapy and a variety of surgical treatments.”

Eight states, many Roman Catholic hospitals, and the Christian Medical and Dental Associations (which represents around 18,000 physicians) opposed the rule. A federal judge in Texas ruled that law only applies to biological sex. The Times continued, “Jennifer C. Pizer, the law and policy director at Lambda Legal, a gay rights group, said, “That is an excruciatingly narrow and legally incorrect definition of the term ‘sex’ that would jeopardize legal protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.”

On July 17, 2018 the Transgender Law Center and National Center for Transgender Equality held a rally in Washington DC under the banner “Protect Trans Health.” Many advocacy organizations demonstrated. The participating National Women’s Law Center tweeted, “We cannot let the Trump-Pence Administration continue the unprecedented attacks on our healthcare by rolling back the Health Care Rights Law…Our health and even our very lives could depend on it,” as well as, “my son and many others could be subject to harassment and humiliation if they seek medical care…no one should fear a trip to the emergency room or doctor if they need care.”

The LGBT group Human Rights Campaign joined in, demanding, “In the past year, 1 in 3 #transgender people experienced discrimination from a doctor. Now, the Trump-Pence administration wants to let doctors pick & choose who deserves care. It’s time to tell HHS to #ProtectTransHealth!” and “Nobody should be turned away from medical care, with their health and lives put at risk, because of who they are. We must #ProtectTransHealth and stop the Trump-Pence administration from green-lighting discrimination.”

I Require Medical Treatment That Mutilates Me

Without citing the statistic or indicating what medical services a transgender person might be denied, it is difficult to fully appreciate what the activists are arguing against. But looking at recent articles detailing the experiences of transgender people claiming to have been denied medical treatment gives us insight into their argument.

In an article titled, “What It Was Like to Be Denied Medical Care Because of My Gender,” Evan Minton described being denied a scheduled hysterectomy at Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a Catholic hospital. Minton called two days prior and explained Minton was transgender and preferred the pronoun “he,” although his records showed him to be female. The hospital canceled the procedure and offered to transfer Minton to another nearby hospital.

Dignity Health, a large medical system of which Mercy San Juan Medical Center is a part, stated, “[T]he services we provide are available to all members of the communities we serve without discrimination. We understand how important this surgery is for transgender individuals, and were happy to provide Mr. Minton and his surgeon the use of another Dignity Health hospital for his surgery within a few days. We do not provide elective sterilizations at Dignity Health’s Catholic facilities in accordance with the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services (ERDs) and the medical staff bylaws.”

ACLU of Northern California lawyer Elizabeth Gill argued in response, “The refusal of Dignity Health to allow a doctor to perform this common procedure simply because the patient is transgender is discriminatory.” She continued, “This is a hospital that is open to the general public so it’s illegal for them to turn away someone based on gender identity.”

Minton’s doctor said this was the first hysterectomy the hospital had prevented her from performing and believed the sole reasoning was because the patient is transgender. The ACLU lawsuit states, “Dr. Dawson routinely performs hysterectomies for her patients, and in fact performed another hysterectomy at MSJMC the same day that Mr. Minton’s surgery had been scheduled. Other physicians who practice at MSJMC also regularly perform hysterectomies at the hospital for patients who have not been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, for indications such as chronic pelvic pain and uterine fibroids.”

I Am a Man Who Needs a Hysterectomy

In a self-reflection, Minton said, “I had come so far in my transition, and the actions by the hospital felt like a complete rejection of who I am. I had rejected myself for 29 years; having my surgery canceled brought back all of those feelings, despite five years of progress and acceptance. It made me feel like I wanted to crawl out of my own skin again.”

Minton continued: “This is what happens when an organization is given a license to discriminate against you because their religious beliefs say people like you don’t exist. My story is one that is devastatingly all too familiar for other trans people across the country, and the situation continues to grow more dire with every passing day under the Trump administration.”

This situation is an important example of how very differently the Left and LGBT activists interpret fairly common situations to be intentionally harmful. As should be clear, Minton was not discriminated against for being transgender at all. Had Minton suffered from common medical conditions in which a hysterectomy is recommended, Minton would not have been denied the surgery at that facility.

The core issue is, despite Minton’s desire to remove Minton’s uterus, there was no medical reasoning for doing so. The procedure was elective, and any woman requesting elective sterilization would be denied in the same way. Even more stunning, the hospital affirmed the transgender treatment, used the patient’s preferred pronoun, and provided an immediate alternative hospital and Minton still perceived the experience as malicious. Minton ultimately received the surgery and therefore was denied nothing. The issue at hand is exclusively in how the individual interpreted the situation.

Pay For Me to Cut Off My Child’s Breasts

Another profound example was of Cheryl Enstad, an employee of a Catholic hospital named PeaceHealth St. Joseph Hospital. Cheryl is the mother of a transgender teenager named Pax. She attempted to have Pax’s double mastectomy covered by her health insurance. From the age of 12 on, she attempted to help with Pax’s gender dysphoria, stating, “We started interventions that were reversible, like shopping for all boy’s clothes, respecting his [sic] name change, and using he/him pronouns. He said binding his chest helped the overwhelming torment he felt.”

But doctors thought continually binding Pax’s breasts was compromising Pax’s breathing and therefore unhealthy. So Cheryl argued for an elective double mastectomy: “This was not an optional surgery; it was a necessity for Pax. I believed—and still believe—that his [sic] life depended on it. His doctor considered it a medically necessary intervention. The American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and WPATH (World Professional Association for Transgender Health) have also all recognized that this surgery is often medically necessary for transgender individuals, including adolescents.”

The hospital’s insurance, however, does not sponsor transgender services and the family paid out of pocket for the surgery. Pax’s mother argues, “As Pax’s suffering became more acute, we found out from his doctors that delaying preventative and necessary medical care would only increase his depression, while putting him at much greater risk for illness and suicide.”

She demanded, “Religion should never be used to deny people critical medical care or to justify discriminating against them. A patient’s healthcare decisions should be made by a patient and their doctor. And when medical procedures are prescribed as necessary, it should not matter whether the patient is transgender or not. Patients should be able to receive the treatment they need.”

The Transgender Narrative Is Simply Dishonesty

Again, as in the previous example, Pax was not denied any treatment. The elective procedure was not covered by the hospital’s employee health insurance. Had a double mastectomy been medically required, there would have been no concern. It is likely elective breast enhancement is not covered for teenage girls who feel insecure about their bodies, either.

No transgender person is denied any routine or emergency service, and there is no threat of this happening.

That really is what is being discussed here. In both situations, as well as implied by activists and organizations, it is asserted people were denied a medical service because they were transgender. In reality, the individuals were asking for an exception to the policy based on their gender identity alone.

A larger conversation is happening here, in which LGBT activists are refusing to discuss the situation honestly. All transgender treatment is elective, and it involves sterilization and the surgical removal of healthy body parts or organs. The argument is not that individuals seeking these treatments are legally denied them, but that a select number of religious organizations are opposed to participating in or paying for them.

This is the whole of the “license to discriminate” argument the activists rally against with such dramatic fear-mongering. They believe transgender individuals have a right to seek any physical alteration necessary to satisfy their sense of gender identity, and that other people should pay for it through health insurance premiums, despite similar medical intervention not being covered for others who don’t suffer from this disorder. While no one argues transgender people should not be free to seek out these services, it is very important that physicians and hospitals be free to refuse to perform elective medical procedures they morally or ethically oppose.

No transgender person is denied any routine or emergency service, and there is no threat of this happening. The fear tactics and extreme language obscure that what is being demanded is unreasonable. While it is certainly worth considering arguments for various medical procedures in alleviating gender dysphoria, it should never be argued that such services should be compulsory, especially for religious organizations.

Doctors are simply not discriminating against transgender people for being transgender. However, religious medical organizations and physicians are facing the possibility of being coerced into participating in elective sterilization and surgical removal of healthy body parts or being accused of discrimination and legally pursued.

Democrats Willing To Make Orphans Casualties In War On Religion,"A House committee passed a bill earlier this month that would allow faith-based adoption and foster-care agencies to continue operating in accord with their moral beliefs. Democrats responded calling the Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act “disgusting, deeply immoral and profoundly offensive,” “unconscionable,” and “shockingly biased.”

The Inclusion Act was first introduced in 2014 to protect faith-based adoption agencies and foster care providers from state and local governments’ discrimination against their services solely because of their religious mission to place children in loving homes with both a mother and a father. The bill sought to counteract a growing trend of invidious discrimination on the basis of faith. It became even more necessary when the city of Philadelphia moved to shut down faith-based foster-care providers earlier this year.

The bill has been accused of being a “license to discriminate” against LGBT couples, but it does nothing to inhibit the ability of LGBT couples to adopt children, nor does it reduce access to adoption for LGBT couples. The Inclusion Act merely discourages states from discriminating against faith-based providers and ensures that as many pipelines as possible remain open to connect children with loving homes.

Needy Children Need More Help to Find Families, Not Less

Consider how the child welfare system works. The state works with adoption agencies and foster care providers to place children in homes. The providers recruit families to adopt or foster the children.

Different providers recruit different types of families. For example, Christian providers, which often work directly with churches or other faith-based charities, usually recruit Christian families. If you get rid of some of the providers, you get rid of some of the families. The fewer providers doing the work of recruitment, the fewer homes for children.

Simple enough, right? Yet the Left obfuscates by claiming LGBT couples should have a right to force providers to violate their faith or go out of business, while showing no concern for children in desperate need of families.

The fact that we are talking about shutting down adoption agencies and foster care providers in the midst of a nationwide opioid crisis, where thousands of children have been displaced from their homes and need families to take care of them, shows just how radical and heartless the progressive movement has grown on any issues labeled LGBT-related. Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee, who voted unanimously to kill the Inclusion Act, made it clear: they would rather see children suffer than tolerate the very existence of faith-based providers. That position is not only indefensible, it’s immoral.

First They Came for Catholic Charities

Since the legalization of same-sex marriage, faith-based child welfare providers have become an early and frequent target of the Left’s pressure campaign. In 2006, Boston Catholic Charities became the first major religious organization to end its adoption services when faced with a choice between violating state law or violating its religious mission of placing children with families with both a mother and a father. Since then, authorities in San Francisco, the District of Columbia, and Illinois have followed suit, forcing faith-based agencies out of their child welfare systems. In Illinois, 3,000 children were displaced as a result.

In Philadelphia, Catholic Social Services is fighting to keep its adoption agency’s doors open amidst pressure from city authorities to abandon its religious mission. The city is presently facing an adoption crisis and could badly use the help of providers such as Catholic Social Services, which currently has 35 open homes for children. Instead, Philadelphia has chosen to fight these faith-based providers in court, putting radical identity politics ahead of children’s real needs.

This storyline is now playing out across the country. And it is likely to be just a warm-up for bigger battles yet to come. While faith-based child welfare providers have been perhaps the most visible and frequent target of the Left’s assault on religious freedom, there are early indications that other religious institutions may soon be caught up in the attacks.

A number of Catholic hospitals have faced lawsuits for declining to facilitate transgender mutilation procedures. States like California and Illinois have gone after pregnancy centers for refusing to promote abortion. Faith-based schools could also soon find themselves in danger of closure by blaspheming to adhere to leftist orthodoxy.

Furthermore, there are signs even churches could eventually find themselves under attack. In Iowa and Massachusetts, houses of worship have already had to take legal measures to combat attempts to force them to open their bathrooms and other public facilities based on an individual’s “gender identity,” which would violate their understanding of human nature. Given current trends, it seems unlikely these will be the last attempts to force churches to substitute political correctness for their doctrine.

The Inclusion Act Is a Last Line of Defense

All these examples point toward the Left increasingly using LGBT issues as a weapon to prevent people of faith from organizing to serve their neighbors in the public square. The Left’s message to religious institutions is clear: Change your beliefs on human beings and sexuality, or be shut down. In many places, the repressive Left is succeeding.

To prevent current skirmishes from growing into a full-scale assault, political action is required, and soon. This is why passing the Inclusion Act is so important, and why the Left is opposing it so vehemently.

The Inclusion Act would draw a line in the sand, not only protecting faith-based child welfare providers but also laying the groundwork to protect other religious institutions. As evidenced above, however, failing to pass this bill would continue to allow leftist persecution of faith-based groups, with far-reaching implications, especially for the neediest and most voiceless in our society.

Passing the Inclusion Act and signing it into law could be the best remaining opportunity for Americans to defend their religious freedom against a tidal wave of religious discrimination that harms American children and families. We would be wise to take it.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/07/23/democrats-willing-make-orphaned-abused-children-casualties-war-religion/,2018-07-23
Trans Activists' Threats To Execute Women Don't Look Like Social Justice,"This article quotes and pictures obscenities, threats, and violent ideations.

A few weeks ago, eight lesbian feminists jumped in to lead the London Pride parade to protest sexism and anti-lesbian hate in the LGBT movement. Men across the Left in several countries have been losing their minds about it ever since. They claim it was an intimidating act of “invalidation,” in a collective tantrum of man-baby fury.

Can you imagine? Lesbians at Pride! Protesting sexism! The nerve.

Women, including many feminists and lesbians, have been making news in the United Kingdom lately for having a series of peaceful political actions to protest the Conservative Party government’s proposed changes to the 2004 Gender Recognition Act, which would eliminate any need for medical diagnosis to be able to change all of a person’s legal documents to conceal his or her birth sex.

Women criticizing this gender identity policy have been accused for many years of being puppets of religious conservatives, an accusation newly revived, even as it has passed beneath comment that its UK fortunes now depend on a good, working relationship with Britain’s Tory Party, and their conservative prime minister.

Women have raised concerns in meetings across the UK about how this would affect all single-sex accommodations, including prisons, domestic violence refuges, women-only recreational facilities, homeless shelters, and the privacy and safety of female patients in some medical settings. Gender activists say it’s “violent” to voice these concerns, and to say aloud that male people can’t be women.

Attendees and speakers at these meetings have been intimidated, assaulted, had their employment threatened, been kicked off of their political party rolls, been subjected to police inquest and disciplinary hearings for making statements of biological fact, and had a recent bomb threat made against one of their meetings. The “violence” of women’s recognition of biological sex is invoked to excuse this as a “proportionate response” from transgender people.

This has all generated considerable press coverage, at last, and I am amazed. When some of the same types of persistent harassment were covered in the U.S. media in 2014, in one New Yorker feature by Michelle Goldberg, the conversation on the political left was mainly about how much of a faux pas she had committed by speaking to radical and gender-critical feminists and reporting what they said. The threats and harassment against women’s events that she reported were roundly trivialized.

Here’s what it’s been like being a woman on the U.S. Left over the last few years, if you refuse to accept the new dogma that biology is a “social fiction.”

A feminist organized a small, gender-critical women’s gathering to talk about violence against women in 2012. They had to move twice because of a bomb threat, and other threats. A stalker infiltrated their meeting, scaring a homeless woman who was fleeing domestic violence and attending with an infant. After that, further events the organizer and her friends set up, in Portland, Toronto, and London, also faced bomb and arson threats, or threats against venue staff.

Another feminist faced a disciplinary hearing at the progressive political organization she worked at, because she said in a diversity training that she didn’t like washing menstrual blood off her hands at the sink in the all-gender restrooms.

A lesbian, female academic at a women’s college has talked about being afraid to note that all the girls who used to come through her classes identifying as butch lesbians are now identifying as trans men.

A female journalist was forced to make a public apology for using the phrase “sausage fest,” as that is now considered transphobic for equating penises with maleness.

Lesbian women have been pushed out of LGBT events and social groups, including groups they founded, for saying they wouldn’t consider male sex partners.

Women have had events cancelled or been shut out of Pagan groups and events, including Dianic Wicca and Red Tent rituals, for wanting women-only religious events.

Many women have been forced to resign, or were fired, like I was, or writers blacklisted, for dissent from a male-centered line on gender identity and the sex trade.

During Pride month this year, a lesbian was beaten up outside of a drag show for being unwilling to lie about another woman’s biological sex.

The weekend before London Pride, a small group of lesbians marched in the San Francisco Dyke March with gender-critical signs. They were assaulted, knocked over, their signs were stolen and torn. The march committee and the National Center for Lesbian Rights blamed the victims for the assaults.

While all of that has been going on (and I have omitted so much), this is some of what we were seeing happen in the public spaces where we formerly felt welcome.

Several LGBT organizations filed amicus briefs supporting a sex change for a man in prison for strangling his wife to death; the operation would likely have forced the state board of prisons to move him to a women’s prison for his own safety, and to the expressed terror of the female inmates.

The American Civil Liberties Union and Southern Poverty Law Center push the idea in numerous court cases that women’s demands for bodily privacy from men are bigoted.

The Obama administration ended the effective right to single-sex accommodations for women in all crisis shelters, prisons, immigration detention centers, and publicly funded schools.

A trans-identified male writes on a feminist site that the fictional killer Buffalo Bill, from “Silence of the Lambs,” is his “auntie” and a hero, and describing his copycat tattoo. This man has previously written that lesbian attraction to other women is discriminatory.

A feminist site interviewed a male prison inmate who was convicted for the rape and murder of a little girl, to ask him what he thought about mean feminists who didn’t agree that he was a woman.

A trans-identified male who appeared at several White House events and held a position on a NYC Young Women’s Advisory Council wrote a Medium article describing himself raping a trans-identified female to try to get her pregnant. Cherno Biko’s name disappeared from progressive spaces without comment.

A trans-identified male who protested the Michigan Women’s Music Festival, as a leader of “Camp Trans,” murdered two lesbians who used to attend the festival, and their son. A site that started as a lesbian media outlet used its coverage of the charges to remind readers to call him “she.”

A respected Canadian doctor who runs the nation’s premier gender identity clinic for minors was fired, and his entire clinic shut down, after a relentless campaign of lies and sustained harassment by gender activists, because he advocates “watchful waiting” with gender dysphoria, instead of affirming and leaping to medicalization.

All of us became nearly numb to the death threats, rape threats, directives to commit suicide, doxxings, and calls for women to be fired over gender politics, over social media.

It has been lonely to face this, to have old friends avoid us, or say that they worry for us, if we are “outed.” In reproductive health, environmental, and LGBT politics, women get messages saying that “TERFs” (a derogatory description for feminists critical of trans ideology) aren’t welcome, that we “should be hung,” or saying “f-ck TERFs.”

Before I was fired for my views, before I had made them known publicly, a former colleague said on Twitter that women like me were “worthless pieces of sh-t” who should “drown themselves.” Our boss knew and didn’t do anything about it.

Last week, Brynn Tannehill wrote a broadside against gender-critical feminists in the Huffington Post, as a means of suggesting that we —that is, left-leaning U.S. women involved with Women’s Liberation Front (WoLF) and the Hands Across The Aisle Coalition — were responsible for the London Pride protest. Tannehill suggested that, through us, liberal women who’ve worked with conservatives, all gender-critical feminists, were therefore doing the bidding of U.S. conservatives.

It’s as if Tannehill thinks that none of us have any ideas or will of our own. He doesn’t even seem to know that feminists have long observed that men on the Left usually support abortion for libertine, rather than feminist, reasons, reducing the whole of women’s politics to that one issue in men’s self-interest. For decades, such libertine leftist men have marginalized feminist concerns about the sex industry, demonizing any woman who dared to make an issue of it as “conservative” or a prude.

To answer Tannehill’s main claim directly, though, we in the United States had nothing to do with the London demonstration. The women whom trans activists have attacked in the UK include many longtime political organizers. They don’t need to phone a friend to plan meetings and protests.

Tannehill, a heterosexually married father who enthusiastically advocates for sterilizing minors, said, “Real feminists, lesbians, queers and bisexual woman should ask what sort of woman or feminist would align themselves with these right-wing organizations.”

What sort of women are we, sir? We are women that your violent, evil-minded fellow travelers have made bomb and arson threats against, harassed, assaulted, gotten fired, stalked, doxxed — gotten excommunicated, if you will, from every left-leaning political space in the United States, for refusing to pretend that you are a woman.

We are the women of whom the trans-identified male, Avery Edison, said on Twitter this week that, “if you ever see a collection of screenshotted posts containing things like ‘f-ck all TERFs to death’, bear in mind that this is a community which is constantly provoked by bigots who wear us down and take any aggressive response as proof we need the abuse” (obscenity altered).

It is, according to this popular transgender pornographer, just blowing off steam for a man to say that he wants to punch me, or rape me to death, because I am a “TERF,” and my words, my opinions, made him angry. It’s so common for people Edison knows to say things like that, that he knows the topic has to be addressed, and he chooses to excuse it. It isn’t the first time I’ve seen a response like that.

This must be fine with Tannehill, and all of the people who’d rather stand with him than with the disobedient women. None of them have said a thing to stop any of this, and we know that they know, because we told them.

I, and other women who know how babies are made, are the women Tannehill’s compatriots say it’s fine to talk about beating, raping, murdering, or executing. It’s a popular joke of theirs to say that we should “get the wall,” as in, be first against the wall for execution when the revolution comes.

In this terrifying climate that gender activists have benefitted from, the source of their power, and the reason that they can pretend only religious conservatives disagree with the doctrine that penises can be female, a man dares to ask why we have decided to work with people with whom we agree on almost nothing else? From the perch of the multimillion-dollar, corporate-backed organizations that support him, he questions a $15,000 grant accepted after the fact, for work we conceived, planned, and executed ourselves? Is he really curious why?

It’s because we have tried everything else, but gender activists wanted to drive us home in silence. The conservatives I’ve talked with are the only ones standing up for me, and they aren’t pretending to be feminists when they aren’t. It’s because gender politics is destroying children’s health, and people’s lives, and women’s most basic rights, and it should be opposed.

If I, or any of my gender-critical friends, were attacked by someone who has said I deserve “the wall” for disagreeing with them, I expect the Left would pretend it didn’t happen. Maybe that seems harsh, but they’ve demonstrated time and again that they care more about the pronouns of trans-identified male murderers than they do about the safety or privacy of women.

None of them will speak out when, as happened again last weekend, the most disgusting threats are made against our lives, because they’re demanding partisan loyalty from women to whom they have refused even the most basic decency or consideration.

Study Finding Lesbians ‘Just As Good’ As Biological Parents Is Fake News,"Do children living with same-sex adults do just as well as kids raised by their mother and father in all the important measures of healthy child well-being? Because it involves children, it’s a terribly important question. The answer is an unquestioned “Absolutely! No difference whatsoever” if you listen to the LGBT movement’s media partisans. But it is not that simple.

You will not find any articles by mainstream journalists taking the slightest critical look at the research they say establishes the “just as good as” fact. Your chances of finding a breezy sit-down interview with a Sasquatch are greater. Last week the Los Angeles Times reported that “Researchers find no difference between kids raised by two moms and kids raised by mom and dad.” The story cited a new article published in the esteemed New England Journal of Medicine.

But the real story, if actually examined by any journalist doing reporting beyond press releases, is that no such reliable conclusion can be reached based on this research itself. An honest inquisitor will easily find that 99.8 percent of the research the press fawns over on this topic is embarrassingly poor in its basic methodology.

These problems would be obvious to sophomore research methodology students, which makes one wonder what’s up with these journalists. Let’s examine the damning problems under the hood in this study that the LA Times reported on.

This inquiry is the National Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study (NLLFS), which began in 1986 following 84 children of lesbian families (77 children currently) that were created via donor insemination. The study seeks to determine how these children fare in a number of developmental measures. Let’s examine the most blatant problems with this long-term project that are obvious under the slightest bit of due diligence.

This Is Clearly an Activist Study

This study is not a dispassionate, purely academic investigation, but an orchestrated persuasion tool conducted and funded by gay-rights activists. The front page of the study’s website even features a photograph of a cute infant lounging in a crib, sporting a onesie that proclaims, “I was hatched by a couple of chicks.”

The NLLFS primary investigators are not scholars in the general, larger field of child development and family formation. Their professional research has been solely in the field of lesbian research. Throughout the project’s many published articles, they offer their readers no survey of the vast literature on how various family forms, such as fatherlessness, affect child development and well-being. They nearly exclusively consult published studies that examine gay or lesbian issues. Such a limited view is profoundly limited and problematic.

The NLLFS is also funded primarily by well-known and powerful pro-gay organizations such as The Gill Foundation, the world’s largest and most influential funder of LGBT political and social causes; the Lesbian Health Fund of the Gay Lesbian Medical Association; and the Williams Institute , where its main investigator, Nanette Gartrell, is a visiting scholar. Gartrell has a long and award-winning history in lesbian-research activism. In 2001, she published “Everyday Mutinies: Funding Lesbian Activism,” a handbook showing how to grow and finance lesbian causes.

Gartrell is also a self-proclaimed polyamorist, coming out decades ago in an article published in the Journal of Lesbian Studies provocatively entitled, “If This Is Tuesday, It Must Be Dee… Confessions of a Closet Polyamorist.” Dee is her partner of 40 years. She admits, “[A]s surprising as it may seem, I do not consider honesty, integrity, and commitment the guiding principle of my intimate life.” Rather, her commitment is to “making each block of time I spend with each lover as glorious as it can be.”

She assures her reader that loving multiple adults should raise no concern. After all, she “would never think to challenge a parent’s capacity to love … multiple children at the same time.” Interesting reasoning to be sure. She concludes her article by hoping that through polys “outing” themselves, “polyamorism will become just as passé’ … as lesbianism is today.” Gartrell is clearly beyond the LGBT mainstream.

But the facts that NLLFS is initiated, conducted, and funded by staunch gay activists and that the principal investigator is beyond the mainstream of the lesbian community do not necessarily mean the study is not a reputable academic investigation. It only lets us know who’s behind it and their possible motivations.

It does raise concerns that a good journalist would inform her reader of as an important part of the story. Suppose this were a study reporting the strong effectiveness of a new drug, conducted and financed by folks with a deep interest and personal stake in the outcome. Would not mentioning that be journalistic malpractice? However, the real problem is found in the structure and execution of the study, which has its own devastating problems.

This Study Has Serious Sample Problems

The serious problems with the study’s sample are clear to even the casual reader. First, the data for the NLLFS was collected on a relatively small group of children being raised in lesbian homes: initially 84 children, now 77. The retention rate in this study is impressively high, which raises a question we will address in a moment.

The authors explain the scatter-shot manner in which they gathered their subjects. Lesbian couples, all in process of getting or already pregnant through donor insemination, were collected in 1986 through “informal networking and word of mouth referrals” and “solicited via announcements at lesbian events, in women’s bookstores, and at lesbian newspapers.” (The study was closed to new participants in January 1992.) The couples were recruited exclusively from three cities: Boston, Washington DC, and San Francisco.

These women were nearly all white (94 percent), middle- and upper-class (82 percent), and mostly college-educated (67 percent). Eighty-two percent were employed in professional or managerial positions. The majority were in their mid-thirties, and thus more mature and well-established in life, at the beginning of the study. They were also reported to be in extraordinarily good health.

These are not typical lesbians, much less average-population couples, but highly privileged and socially unique. Of course outcome findings would be elevated given this kind of a non-representative sample. Given challenge from some quarters, the authors of this study now admit in this latest article that, given the weaknesses of their sample, the study’s effect sizes and statistical power are both low and thus, “[t]he results should be interpreted with caution.” The Los Angeles Times story and all others in the mainstream press failed to employ such caution nor include this not-so-insignificant warning, however.

Highly Motivated Participants

Perhaps even more problematic, the study’s participants were no doubt highly motivated to participate in this study and likely very desirous of positive findings. As the authors confess, “Participants were strongly lesbian-identified, 89% had come out to families of origin, 55% were open about their lesbian identity at work, 38% were active in a lesbian/gay organization at work, and 80% said they would choose to be a lesbian, if it were a matter of a choice” (emphasis in original).

The mothers were asked to self-report their children’s well-being and development.

So these participants are actively participating in ideological lesbian thought and political culture and deeply committed to being lesbian. The study further explains, “Prospective participants [solicited through known lesbian networks as explained above] were asked to contact the researchers by telephone. The study was discussed with each caller, and all interested callers became participants” (emphasis added).

So these are highly motivated lesbian mothers, gathered through what researchers call snowball or convenience samples via the political lesbian culture. Each were told the nature of the study, allowing each respondent to easily ascertain the social, political, academic, and historical significance of the effort, and all callers joined the study. No caller chose not to participate. It begs considering whether these realities have any impact on the fact that the study has maintained a remarkable 93 percent retention rate over its history.

Given these facts, and even more concerning, the mothers were asked to self-report their children’s well-being and development. This can lead to a “social desirability bias” where respondents are inclined to give answers that align with their convictions, rather than their actual objective experiences or outcomes.

Who can suggest this is not happening here? This most likely explains how the study arrived at some very curious findings at odds with the larger body of data about family formation and child well-being.

These Curious Findings Contradict Most Studies

It is the extremely rare study in the larger body of general research (those not looking exclusively at kids from same-sex homes) that finds kids raised apart from their own biological mother or father do as well as children who grow up in their natural families. Nearly all of this mountain of research shows the opposite, and powerfully so.

This includes children raised in heterosexual fatherless, divorced, cohabiting, widowed, adoptive, and step-family homes. None of the kids raised in any of these homes mirror kids living with their married, biological parents. But NLLFS finds that lesbian-headed families are the first divergent family form that produces all the same benefits that natural mother/father families do.

The NLLFS has reported that kids in lesbian-headed homes actually do better than kids in heterosexual-parented homes.

If true, this is major news. In fact, to make all this even more stunning, the NLLFS has reported that kids in lesbian-headed homes actually do better than kids in heterosexual-parented homes. The NLLFS explains their “adolescents demonstrated higher levels of social, school/academic, and total competence than gender-matched normative samples of American teenagers.”

This could very well be true, but not because of lesbian families themselves. It’s due to the extremely favorable characteristics of the lesbian homes participating in this study, and the fact these moms are self-reporting how well their kids are doing for a study they know is laying the foundation for cultural, policy, and legal acceptance of their families. Yes, it really is that embarrassingly problematic.

On top of this, the NLLFS’s data tells us nothing about what the average lesbian-headed home raising children from birth are likely to produce. Nothing. No mainstream news source, including the Los Angeles Times last week, has ever noted this critical fact.

Given this “just-as-good-as” and the “better-than” conclusion, one would have to conclude fathers are simply superfluous as players in healthy child development. In fact, we are handicapping children by giving them a father, if this research is to be believed.

Of course, this is ridiculous, as it flies in the face of more than five decades and hundreds of published studies indicating that fathers play an irreplaceable role in fostering healthy child-development in ways that mothers do not. It has been demonstrated consistently that children who grow up apart from their fathers face serious difficulties and short-comings compared to children who do not. This data has been persuasive enough to compel the Clinton, Bush and Obama presidential administrations all to institute federal programs to encourage strong fatherhood involvement in the lives of children.

The Study Reports No Harm When Lesbians Break Up

Additionally, the NLLFS found that the “rate of parental relationship dissolution was significantly higher in lesbian families than the average mom/dad family,” a distinction of 56 percent versus 36 percent. Amazingly, the study did not find this was a negative in terms of child well-being, contrary to all other research on broken families. The investigators explain,

Although the offspring of divorced heterosexual parents have been shown to score lower on measures of emotional, academic, social, and behavioral adjustment, no differences in psychological adjustment were found when the 17-year-old NLLFS adolescents whose mothers had separated were compared with those whose mothers were still together. (emphasis added)

The NLLFS reports the same thing in another article published in Pediatrics: “adolescents whose mothers had separated since [the study’s beginning] fared as well in psychological adjustment as those whose mothers were still together.” If the NLLFS findings are to be believed, they indicate that lesbian-headed families are the new super-families. They show better results than mother/father-headed homes. The second mom is more positively consequential than a father, and when these couples do break up, there is no harm to the children.

Infamous studies like this are opening up a future for more children to be raised in experimental homes.

Again, this huge news, absolutely turning everything we know about family formation and child well-being totally upside down. It’s an absolute Copernican-like revolution.

Or might reason call us to question the NLLFS study altogether? To summarize, the particular lesbian mothers participating in the NLLFS study were a small sample drafted very selectively through their deep commitment to lesbian culture and political causes; very privileged socio-economically; knowing they are participating in a very politically important study, and deeply eager to do so; and allowed to self-report their child’s well-being.

What reasonable person cannot conclude these facts are not deadly to the integrity of this study and the public conclusions reported about it? This study has received unquestioned praise from the mainstream press, pro-LGBT politicians, and judges, and become a foundation for changing policy and law. It’s time these people be forced to answer for their deceptive work.

Infamous studies like this are opening up a future for more children to be raised in experimental homes, and for no other reason that certain adults desire them. No ethical standard allows for children to be guinea pigs in any experiment, however, regardless of the positive and emotional rhetoric used to justify it.

When you continue to read the bold and uncritical fawning over studies by the mainstream press offering “the kids are alright” claims—and you will—the honest reader with any level of discernment will have to take such reporting with great skepticism. It’s unfortunate our major newspapers and magazine journalists do not, given what’s at stake.

"Why LGBT Teens Should Try To Work With Parents, Not Run Away","A recent story about a gay teenager being kicked out of his family’s home has stirred up many difficult emotions and spurred outrage from LGBT Americans. A major LGBT online publication, Queerty, first reported on the story with the headline, “Teen’s parents threw him to the curb for being gay, but just look at him now.”

The article summarizes the experience: “After his dad snooped through his phone and discovered Seth is gay, he was thrown out of the house by his zealous parents.” It goes on to celebrate the young man for being co-valedictorian of his class and pursing college despite being “made homeless” by his parents.

When I first read this article, it brought back memories of my own involuntary coming out experience. The young man, Seth Owen, and I have a lot in common in this way.

When I was 15 years old, my dad stumbled through some of my browsing history on his work computer, where I had begun to explore websites like Gay.com during moments I was alone. He confronted me later that night in a tearful and agitated rant that included the threat of kicking me out of his home and disowning me if I continued “down this path.”

The most clear and striking moment I remember today with a deep sense of pain was him insisting I would no longer be his son if I were truly “this way.” Shortly after, I was alone in my grandfather’s house a street or so over, angrily sobbing in front of the bathroom mirror and feeling overwhelmed and completely lost.

The Heat of the Moment Can Singe Our Perception

I moved in with my grandfather and we never spoke of it again until I was outed later in high school. By then my father had largely accepted the matter. While he rarely spoke of it directly, he eventually told me he had known all along but genuinely had no idea what to do or how to connect with me again.

When I was outed a year later, I was suspended from school and required to go to counseling. That counseling involved lengthy discussions about my self-perceived sexual orientation and encouragement towards reconsidering my choice to pursue a gay identity. Before all this happened, I had been a top-performing student. Unlike Owens, however, I dropped into the bottom rung of my graduating class by my senior year, and barely graduated. I didn’t go to college for another four years.

But as with Owen’s story, mine is a little more nuanced than I just described, which is how I discussed it for more than a decade. While everything is absolutely true, my perception of events is not entirely accurate.

Owen, as detailed in a local news report, was not kicked out of his family home for being gay. He explains that when he was around 15 his father looked through his phone and found a picture clearly indicating he was gay. After several hours of discussion, he was sent to a counselor: “They made it clear the intention was to make me straight. (That) was their end goal,” he said. The counseling was apparently short-lived, and he went living at home for several more years.

During this time, he held part-time jobs, excelled in school, and participated in many after-school programs and swimming. His family appears to have embraced him all along the way, and the issue of his sexuality seemly did not resurface during that time.

Feeding a Rejection Can Be Dangerous

This is where Owen and I split in shared experience. As I discussed at length in a Huffington Post article titled “What Happens When Men Have Sex With Teenage Boys,” living mostly on my own with my grandfather allowed me the freedom to pursue my sexuality unhindered. For me this translated into remarkably dangerous anonymous sexual encounters with adult men in secret as I desperately tried to find some sense of security and identity.

I hid in my grandfather’s house and lived two lives: one where I acted like a disinterested, manic, and attention-seeking teenager prone to eccentric creativity, and the other where I lived in fear and shame on the streets getting in and out of strange men’s cars in the middle of the night. I resented my family, my peers, my church, and my society for not accepting me. Every aspect of LGBT media I could find propped up that perception.

My grades suffered as I clung to the fantasy of escaping my conservative, Christian, backwards rural life into the freedom and acceptance of the gay community in some far distant city. I reveled in getting attention through ridiculous clothing, dying my hair as often as I could persuade my grandfather for a few dollars, and a flamboyant and dark humor that came off as concerning in a post-Columbine world.

Coming Out Coincided with Acting Out in Other Ways

I was outed by a friend, who told a teacher, who reported it to the principal, who called my father. I was brought into a meeting with the school counselor, my father, and several school officials and teachers to discuss my unpredictable behavior, which included coming out. I was the first openly gay student at my school and in 1998 the school had no idea what to do with me.

But I was not suspended from school and ordered to seek counseling because I was gay. The school was also concerned about my erratic behavior, extreme drop in grades, emotional instability, and sometimes disturbing goth-inspired dark humor. They gave me a week off to allow the rumors and my emotional state to settle down.

We would likely refer to my counselor’s approach as “conversion therapy” today based on her perception that my concerning behavior contributed to my new identity. We discussed my risky sexual behaviors, acting out, and seemingly sudden change in self-identity, which she felt indicated a larger issue. We discussed the legitimacy of my sexual orientation and postponing further sexual activity and identity into adulthood, but I perceived this as an attempt to “turn me straight.”

Owen’s family attended a small Baptist church and seemingly ran a strict, religious household. His choice to leave home at 18 was spurred by an argument with his father over mandatory family attendance at the church. He disapproved of the pastor’s views on feminism, LGBT behavior, and other conservative Christian positions, and no longer wanted to attend. He reported that his father gave him an ultimatum to go to church or move out. He chose to move out, although it seems he simply wanted to attend a different church.

Even If They React Badly, Your Parents Love You

Years after my own somewhat parallel experience, I can shed a little more light into how my father felt about my choices. Although my father was never really aware of my sexually risky behavior, he knew I was staying out all night and was obsessed with the Internet. He watched, helplessly, as my future crumbled around me from my hostility towards school.

Later he told me that he thought he was doing the right thing by staying out of the way. He read about how to parent a gay child, which largely recommended allowing me to pursue my own path and avoid further confrontation. He told me he was afraid that if he asked me questions or asserted any parental authority I would shut down even more and he might lose me to running away or worse.

He watched, helplessly, as my future crumbled around me from my hostility towards school.

Between my father shouting that he would disown me and me sobbing alone at my grandfather’s house, my father hugged me, crying, and told me he loved me. For a long time, however, I only remembered the anger and judgment.

LGBT media and advocacy have created an implied standard of absolute acceptance and celebration as the only way to lovingly react to your child coming out as gay or transgender. After reading frightening statistics such as 29 percent of gay teens consider suicide and 40 percent of homeless teens are LGBT, with 68 percent indicating family rejection as the reason for leaving home, parents can feel helpless in their own parenting.

But LGBT teens face other concerns that advocacy organizations are not addressing. Between 18 and 23 percent of LGBT teens have experienced dating violence, sexual violence, and rape from same-sex partners. Gay and bisexual youth between the ages of 13 and 24 account for 92 percent of new HIV infections in their respective age and gender group.

While Owen and I experienced this in different social climates, our outcomes can be compared. He may have lived in a home with religious rules and an understanding his sexuality was not accepted, but he wasn’t, as far as we know, out at 3 a.m. waiting for a stranger to pick him up for sex because he had total freedom to do as he pleased.

Let’s Have Empathy for Both Parents and LGBT Teens

There must be a middle ground, and a level of empathy and understanding for parents in this situation as well as for their often distressed teens. Today, Owen’s church is being bombarded with hateful accusations on their Facebook page due to being named in various accounts of this story. His father, who has not been quoted directly so far, is the perfect LGBT iconic villain proving their decades-long narrative of a hostile and dangerous home life for LGBT teens. The details come exclusively from the young man, who is emotionally acting out what LGBT advocacy groups insist is his only choice.

It is simply not considered that due to their faith, his family expressed love and concern for their son, an exceptionally successful young man. They clearly want the best for him. From their perspective, they have tried to give that to him, based on his own account of their actions.

I genuinely hope Owen is able to appreciate his parents if they were honestly just trying to love him the best way they knew how.

As opposed to cruelly kicking him out, they set strict rules for family behavior and as an adult he is expected to make his own choices. There is no indication the counseling was of a conversion therapy nature and could simply have been an attempt to address what appeared to be a sudden and concerning shift in their son’s behavior. All of these attributes matter and must be considered when discussing these stories.

LGBT youth may very well face abuse or rejection so profound they feel running away from home is their only option. But based on the long history of LGBT reporting on these incidents, the truth often reflects the young person’s overreaction to the lack of their family’s immediate celebration of their revelation. LGBT media, advocacy, and narrative call this “hate” and the young person a “victim.” In truth, it could simply be a matter of communication and honesty.

Looking back, I often wonder what would have happened if my father hadn’t given up control and had chosen instead to impose a more strict home life for me. If he had restricted my Internet access or monitored my behavior and school work more closely, would I have rebelled, or begrudgingly developed a more stable teenage experience?

I genuinely hope Owen is able to appreciate his parents if they were honestly just trying to love him the best way they knew how. I further hope he is able to understand why his faith community views this experience in the way that they do without merely resorting to judging them as “hateful.”

Finally, I hope one day LGBT people at large can appreciate that acceptance can need time to develop, and encouraging young people to resent their families creates much of the toxic outcomes we see today. There are many sides to every story, and it is our duty to fairly consider each.

"If We Don’t Ban Fortune Tellers, We Shouldn’t Ban ‘Conversion Therapy’","When the topic of “conversion” or “ex-gay” therapy comes up, it invokes images of sad, lonely, and desperate gay men and women praying to cease being who they are. It can conjure the image of a domineering religious figure shouting to the heavens of hell and demons over a terrified child.

Others, especially in the LGBT media, revel in the anticipation of catching well-known ex-gays in sexually compromising positions. But for the most part, the practice seems like a relic from another time, and only a small number of the religiously devout ever encounter it. In 2014, only 8 percent of Americans believed the therapy was effective.

LGBT advocacy groups, however, have for many years fixated on the practice as a foundational threat to LGBT young people and have sought to ban it nationwide. Recently the Washington Post published a detailed history of the practice. The article argues that conversion therapy is essentially a civil rights issue, going so far as to claim its existence threatens American LGBT people’s citizenship: “Americans cannot be fully equal members of society so long as a practice exists that aims to convert them — implying that there is something wrong with being LGBTQ.”

In 2012, California became the first state to ban the practice on minors, and 11 other states have followed suit. Most recently, New Hampshire sent a bill banning the practice to the governor to sign. The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) activist group celebrated with a tweet stating, “Children across the Granite State deserve to live their lives authentically and should never be subjected to the abusive practice of so-called conversion therapy.” Most leading medical organizations oppose the practice and have endorsed the Therapeutic Fraud Prevention Act, which would make “conversion therapy” illegal nationwide.

What Is ‘Conversion Therapy,’ Anyway?

The practice consists of a broad range of concepts but is essentially designed to change an individual’s perception of sexual attraction, primarily from homosexual to heterosexual. These methods mostly involve variations of talk therapy, similar to addiction therapy or behavior modification therapy. In the past, aversion treatments that applied negative stimulation such as vomiting to force the mind to reject certain images or ideas.

In a religious context, it is often considered a spiritual effort to change thinking patterns or desires. Hypnosis therapy is used in many modern applications. According to the Williams Institute, 698,000 LGBT adults in the United States have received some form of conversion therapy, either from a licensed professional or religious leader, in their lives. This represents about 5 percent of the LGBT population.

Most of the research on the effects of the practice rely on anecdotal reporting, as the Williams Institute study did. Adults are asked about their experiences and the resulting negative consequences. As a result, as HRC describes it, “Minors are especially vulnerable, and conversion therapy can lead to depression, anxiety, drug use, homelessness, and suicide.”

The primary argument highlights the position of all major medical organizations that the practice is ineffective and merely results in participants feeling victimized, helpless, and rejected. Based on the assumption that those who experienced the therapy were rejected by their families, these experiences in victimization are very negative.

My Experience with ‘Conversion Therapy’ Seems Typical

In my mid-teens, I attempted “reparative therapy,” as it was called at the time. I worked with a therapist to deal with intense depression and shame over my risky sexual behaviors. The therapist viewed homosexuality as a protective adaptation to trauma and a confusion of affection and so on, and attempted to guide me towards moving my sexual fixation to normal teenage pursuits and addressing my sexuality later as an adult.

She did not believe I was gay, and we spent a great deal of time discussing all the possible reasons for both my attraction and my responses to it. Shortly afterward, I began working with a local pastor who agreed to have weekly meetings with me to discuss my “spiritual struggle.” The sessions essentially focused on prayer and emotional and intellectual discipline from a Christian perspective.

While I wouldn’t call the practice abusive, it certainly wasn’t beneficial, as it largely resulted in me keeping feelings and behaviors more secretive. I also acted out in more risky ways. I felt a great deal of shame for failing at my spiritual goals and essentially spent several months more obsessed over my internal experience.

I wouldn’t recommend the experience, but I certainly wouldn’t characterize it in the extreme language LGBT advocates often use. For example, a well-known drag queen named Dusty Ray Bottoms detailed his experience in an article for Newsweek. He describes his church praying with him and asking him about his feelings, thoughts, and fears shortly after he accidentally came out to his family. He then pursued weekly spiritual meetings with his pastor.

This Subject Requires Education, Not Legislation

This demonstrates the frustration in discussing this topic. LGBT advocacy groups rely on fear tactics to push legal solutions to a social issue. The Williams Institute study asserts, as cited by the HRC, “an estimated 20,000 LGBTQ minors in states without protections will be subjected to conversion therapy by a licensed healthcare professional if state officials fail to act.”

Transgender individuals were categorized as experiencing conversion therapy if they had ever spoken to a therapist or religious leader who told them they were not transgender or attempted to persuade them not to transition, increasing the percentage related to a different form of sexual expression than homosexuality. This estimate is also based on the self-reporting of adults and assuming the same proportion of LGBT youth, adjusted for modern population growth in the category, will experience it at the same rate. Yet society today is markedly more accepting of homosexuality and, as we saw above, very few Americans think conversion therapy might be “effective.”

Let’s make a comparison to another therapeutic activity lots of people participate in. People magazine featured an episode of “I Am Jazz” where the teenage transgender reality star underwent a past life regression, a combination of hypnosis and talk therapy that has participants delve into purported past lives for insight into current emotional pain. The hypnotist instructed Jazz Jennings to “go to” Jennings’ former self’s last day and recall its pain and regret. Jennings broke down into sobbing anxiety over imagining a past life as a gay boy denied true love.

In the United Kingdom, a man committed suicide after visiting a psychic who encouraged him to pursue his suicidal desires as part of his spiritual experience. An Elle.com article detailed the pain and struggle of a young woman who sought the help of psychics for more than a year, spending thousands of dollars, and experiencing intense depression, anxiety, and hopelessness as a result.

Like these people, 15 percent of Americans say they have visited a fortuneteller or psychic. If the anti-conversion therapy argument relies on paid therapy as consumer fraud, the full spectrum of New Age services should be equally at issue. In the same way, any service promising an extraordinary and otherwise impossible life-changing result has the potential to induce severe and negative reactions in vulnerable people when they fail.

Let’s Consider the Potential Unintended Consequences

There is nothing particularly unique in conversion therapy techniques that indicate it requires specialized regulation. Rather than understanding it within the realm of their own arguments, LGBT activists seem simply fixated on denouncing any attempts or consideration of changing sexual orientation or gender identity.

These activists would also impose potential restrictions on speech and religious expression outside of the therapist’s office.

To this end, it seems their efforts may result in more genuinely dangerous risks for LGBT youth or adults seeking alternative options for unwanted feelings or desires. Licensing and payment systems provide transparency and public scrutiny. If a professional is required to maintain a public business with certification, he or she is more likely to follow the rules.

There is a difference between answering a Craigslist ad for crystal healing therapy and visiting an acupuncturist and paying with your health insurance. By reducing the options to unregulated religious intervention, LGBT activists are positioning LGBT youth into the very position of vulnerability and danger they profess to oppose.

Even to more conservative Christians like evangelicals, in younger Christians 51 percent say homosexuality should be accepted. Churches that embrace ex-gay interventions may be far more on the fringe than in previous generations. Parents who believe homosexuality is a spiritual issue that must be intercepted through religious means will simply move from official therapeutic paths to less conventional, and less transparent, religious options after conversion therapy bans.

Furthermore, in their efforts to expunge the very idea of “correcting” sexual orientation and now gender identity from society, these activists would impose potential restrictions on speech and religious expression outside of the therapist’s office. Even the sale of books on the topic of binary gender identity or a Christian or Jewish speaker discussing same-sex attraction or transgenderism as anything other than legitimate permanent characteristics could be legally impacted.

LGBT Leaders Are Stuck in the Past

It is also important to note that many gay individuals and members of groups such as GetTheLOut view transgender gender-change procedures as conversion therapy. It must always be remembered that progressive policy never stops at the original intended purpose and will always expand and limit freedom.

Their continued obsession over old battles is beginning to affect society in ways we did not imagine before.

All this never should have reached legislative intervention. When I came out as a teenager at the turn of the century, society was still discussing the possibility of a gay teenager. Nearly 20 years later, we are discussing the gender identity of toddlers. The leaders of the LGBT movement are trapped in another era and the consequences of their continued obsession over old battles is beginning to affect society in ways we did not imagine before.

Imagine a future, far more real than we might recognize, where a child recently learning of gender identity options asks if he too is transgendered and no professional adult around him legally allowed to tell him “no” or guide him in another direction. Without reasonable limitation, progressive laws once designed to protect LGBT youth from perceived abusive and unethical medical practices will quickly grow to silence any form of dissent of officially approved gender identity theory.

This will include ideas promoted by gays and lesbians just a decade or so ago as scientific fact. The law should never be used to validate a political ideology, and the effort to ban conversion therapy has proven this more relevant than ever.

Celebrating Sharice Davids For Identity Politics Cuts Her Achievements,"Sharice Davids recently won the Democratic nomination for a House seat in Kansas. She has a remarkable story, and her accomplishment gives the everyday person with political aspirations hope of achieving those goals.

Davids was raised by a single mother who dedicated her life to military service for 20 years and, alongside her daughter, earned a degree later in life. Sharice is a lawyer who graduated from Cornell University, and a highly trained and accomplished mixed martial arts fighter.

She was one of 16 selected for the White House fellowship program from 2016-2017. She has lived on Native American reservations helping to build economic opportunities. Sharice has a great deal to be proud of, and has accomplished more than most to better the world around her. She also happens to be gay.

But you wouldn’t know any of her accomplishments if you followed the major headlines announcing her nomination. The Hill tweeted the headline, “Openly gay Dem wins House primary, would be first Native American woman elected to Congress.” CNN Politics announced her win writing, “An openly gay ex-MMA fighter may become the first Native American congresswoman.” Out Magazine titled their story, “Openly Gay Native American Wins Kansas Democratic Primary.”

While many news outlets did include Davids’s name in the headline, all of them described her sexuality and ethnicity. In a tweet, comedian Chelsea Handler proclaimed, “Sharice Davids, an openly gay Democrat won the House primary and could be the first Native American woman elected to Congress. Woman, Lesbian, Democrat, Native American. She is this administration’s biggest nightmare. Go, girl, go.”

This Is a Frequent Habit

The same thing happened with Maryland state House candidate Gabriel Acevero. He also came from a place many throughout our nation can identify with and be inspired by. His parents immigrated to the United States from Trinidad. Although he grew up in a lower-income household, he accomplished his dream of earning two degrees.

He is a union representative for the Municipal and County Government Employees Organization. Throughout college and into his professional career he has fought for his ideals. He also recently won his primary. However, the announcement of his accomplishment came without recognition of him as a person or a candidate.

The Washington Blade, similarly to other LGBT news organizations, headlined their story about it “Gay Afro-Latino Md. House candidate wins primary.” In the article they describe his potential victory this November, saying, “Acevero would be the first openly gay man of Afro-Latino descent elected to the General Assembly if he were to win in November.”

This trend in simply describing minority individuals by their various social categories is not new. In December 2017, The Hill chose to describe South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott’s rebuke of a claim that he was a “prop” featured alongside President Trump celebrating Trump’s tax bill, which Scott helped write, tweeting, “Black GOP senator tears into writer who called him a ‘prop’ at Trump’s tax bill celebration.”

The Worst Example Might Be Crystal Griner

Possibly the most egregious example of this style of media characterization was used against Crystal Griner, who saved the life of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise and others in a 2017 politically motivated shooting. Griner, a special agent and a Capitol Police officer, was shot while protecting Scalise and others and taking down the gunman. Combined with the efforts of the other police officers protecting a charity baseball practice, she is credited for preventing a much more devastating loss of life.

Scalise tweeted after the attack saying, “David Bailey and Crystal Griner have been part of our family for years, and they are my heroes.” President Trump and the First Lady visited Griner and her wife in the hospital, bringing them flowers shortly after the attack. In July 2017, President Trump awarded Griner the Medal of Valor where she accepted the award on crutches, recovering from her injuries.

The media, however, fixated exclusively on the fact that Griner is a lesbian. Ana Marie Cox, a political writer, tweeted, “That’s right: a lesbian woman of color rescued a ballfield full of white GOP dudes.” Michelangelo Signorile of the Huffington Post wrote an article titled, “Rep. Steve Scalise’s Life Was Saved By A Black Queer Woman. Here’s Why That Matters,” and argues “If God saved the members of Congress, then God is a Black queer woman ― or is working through her. And they need to know that.”

Another article in the Huffington Post was titled, “Anti-LGBT Member Of Congress Shot; His And Other Lives Saved By African American Lesbian Officer.” ABC News more simply titled their account “Lesbian Police Officer Hailed a Hero After Virginia Shooting.” A few months after the event, Scalise spoke at the Values Voter Summit, a conservative event, and the Huffington Post reported, “Steve Scalise To Speak At Anti-Gay Group’s Forum Months After Lesbian Cop Saved His Life.”

This style of reporting obscures the individual inside the identity politics narrative he or she represents. Griner is a hero, but as far as the majority of the media was concerned, her only contribution to the story was her sexuality. It was useful in providing ironic contrast to their preferred narrative of accusing Republicans of being anti-LGBT and racist.

To the Left, it seems, what you represent is far more valuable than who you are as a person or what you have accomplished. These examples demonstrate a trend of exploiting the racial, ethnic, sex, and sexual orientation characteristics of the individual to promote a politicized idea of “diversity.” The Left is extremely fixated on the self-evident value of diversity represented through inherent characteristics rather than the diversity found in the human experience that those characteristics inspire.

While we may joke that an openly gay Native American woman has finally been recognized for her achievements to get the point across to the Left, it is not too far off from the reality of this practice. This is true for everyone mentioned above and who has ever found himself holding up the title of the “first” of any social category in any given field.

While it is clear, for example, that Davids is proud of her Native American heritage, she is not solely defined by that characteristic. She is an individual and an accomplished person, and her success is not valuable solely due to her ethnicity and the fact she happens to also be gay.

This Is Exploiting People for Trivial Political Point-Scoring

On the surface it often appears as though the Left enjoys opportunities to taunt Republicans with successful people of color or minority sexuality for the sake of proving a point. They assume Republicans or conservatives would be upset or offended by the success of this person because of the Left’s identity categories they happen to fit.

It is ultimately a great insult to the individuality, ambition, struggle, and success of those who find themselves symbols of the resistance.

Announcing that a person is black or gay or a woman is assumed to be enough to both instigate a negative response from Republicans and rebuke their assumed bias. But in practice all it does is reduce an individual to a symbol or object useful only as a political tool to demonstrate an ideological point. At worst, it mocks the individual as somehow being successful only because of his or her given social characteristic.

In truth, it is ultimately a great insult to the individuality, ambition, struggle, and success of those who find themselves symbols of the resistance or plot twists in a larger political story. Behind these caricatures are real people with real lives who deserve to be celebrated on what they have achieved, not in spite of who they are but because of what they chose to do with their lives.

Identity politics is not defined by recognizing diverse backgrounds and life experiences for their unique contributions to society, but an active segregation of people into useful categories for political purposes. Despite their moral belief in celebrating the public success of specific minority groups, the consequences result in less dignity and respect for those they promote.

At the very least, each individual deserves to be called by his or her name. Moving forward, I hope the media chooses to give these accomplished people that basic respect in their reporting.

Why It's Preposterous To Call Kavanaugh A 'Threat' To LGBT Americans,"The Human Rights Campaign released a report in August on President Trump’s pick to replace Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court. It’s titled, “Brett M. Kavanaugh: Wrong for LGBTQ People. Wrong for the Supreme Court.”

HRC Legal Director Sarah Warbelow declared in a press release, “Kavanaugh has a troublingly lengthy, far-right pedigree, and he was hand-picked by anti-LGBTQ, anti-choice groups in an explicit effort to undermine equality.” Kavanaugh would allow a “license to discriminate” that would affect the everyday lives of LGBT Americans, she claimed. “If confirmed, Kavanaugh will undoubtedly bring a dangerous brand of ideological partisanship that has no place on the Court.”

Sounds serious. But a closer look at the report reveals a far less tangible threat than its emotional assertions suggest. Let’s take it from the top.

The report says Kavanaugh has a “thin record” on LGBT-related cases, and has not “substantially addressed” any LGBT Supreme Court cases in the 12 years he was a DC Circuit judge. Kavanaugh is also judged guilty by association because of his vocal support of Justice Antonin Scalia and Chief Justice William Rehnquist, whom the report says have the worst anti-LGBT records in modern history.

Rehnquist joined in a majority opinion in the 1986 case of Bowers v. Hardwick, in which a gay man in Georgia had been charged with violating the state’s sodomy law while in his home. While the district attorney did not bring charges to the grand jury, Hardwick brought a suit to challenge the constitutionality of the Georgia law, which applied to both homosexual and heterosexual individuals.

In the majority opinion, the judges state that the issue at hand was not whether sodomy laws were just or whether states could determine private sexual behavior between consenting adults. The issue was whether the Constitution specifically recognized a right to homosexual sex and held authority to override the laws of all states related to homosexual acts. The court could not determine this to be the case.

Scalia dissented in Obergefell based on his objection to the Supreme Court holding authority over state legislatures in the matter of marriage, but said he did not oppose states instituting same-sex marriage. The report charges Kavanaugh with failing to “distance himself from the extreme and outmoded comments and beliefs advanced by Scalia and Rehnquist.”

The secondary issue at hand is that Kavanaugh views the Constitution from an “originalist” perspective, which the HRC says “could result in an implementation of the Constitution that is essentially frozen in the 1700s.”

In this same vein, the report notes Kavanaugh praised Rehnquist in his dissent in Roe v. Wade, arguing that helped “stem[] the general tide of free-wheeling judicial creation of unenumerated rights that were not rooted in the nation’s history and tradition.” The report adds: “Kavanaugh went on to praise other ‘important precedents limiting the Court’s role in the realm of social policy and helping to ensure that the Court operates more as a court of law and less as an institution of social policy.'”

The report cites Kavanaugh’s vocal opposition to abortion on demand and his open praise for the court decision that permitted Hobby Lobby to remain exempt on religious grounds from the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act. The report connects this to LGBT issues by asserting that Roe v. Wade is confirms a constitutional right to privacy. So by opposing Roe, Kavanaugh is opposing broader privacy rights that could affect LGBT Americans, the report says.

Additionally, his open support of the right to religious freedom confirmed in Hobby Lobby is determined to indicate a support for companies to deny employees medical treatment related to HIV, fertility treatment for same-sex couples, or hormone therapy for transgender individuals. The report states,

The unfortunate reality is that religious beliefs have long been used as a basis to deny LGBTQ people access to basic civil rights. However, exactly what Hobby Lobby will mean for LGBTQ rights hinges on the future composition of the Supreme Court. If a justice like Kavanaugh is confirmed, then the logic of Hobby Lobby could be further extended to allow discrimination against LGBTQ people at work, school, and beyond under the guise of religious expression.

In addition to repeatedly claiming Kavanaugh is pushing “license to discriminate,” the HRC finds reason for concern in Kavanaugh’s views on the ACA. “Kavanaugh has launched several broader attacks on the constitutionality and structure of the Affordable Care Act, a statute which has made health care coverage a reality for many LGBTQ individuals and their families for the first time,” the report states.

While this statement has a strange assumption, (LGBT individuals and families certainly had health care coverage long before the ACA), the report connects the issue to contraception. “The bottom line of Kavanaugh’s approach to contraceptives and federal health care laws is to threaten the access to reproductive and health care services which have proven to be so essential for LGBTQ people,” the report states. Based on his opposition to the ACA, and somehow supposedly to contraception, the report argues Kavanaugh puts laws providing LGBT education and health-care services in “jeopardy.”

Early in the report, the HRC contends that Kavanaugh’s confirmation would put into question whether LGBT individuals and their families could be turned away from businesses, be discriminated against in employment, housing, and health care, and whether transgender individuals would be denied access to military service. It seems the basis of these concerns is speculation that Kavanaugh’s otherwise uncontroversial conservative positions are a direct threat to LGBT American citizens. The report simply asserts without any direct evidence that anyone holding conservative views of the separation of powers and the validity of the Constitution is somehow also an anti-LGBT advocate.

The report also makes several assumptions about the purpose of the court and the universal agreement of highly controversial cases such as Roe and Hobby Lobby. Without intellectual curiosity or consideration, it implies that holding a position liberals find objectionable is in itself an extreme and frightening revelation. In truth, it is more likely that these views are widespread and even shared by a majority of the population.

Interestingly, when looking more closely at the cornerstone examples of anti-LGBT bias in the court, we find only a firm and principled view of the purpose of the court itself. While the language and views of homosexuality are often dated, and by today’s standards objectionable, the core of the decisions rely on a faulty view of the Supreme Court. The court’s role should be to determine whether a law is constitutional — its role is not, as the report implies, to declare truth, justice, or morality.

In this way the HRC report reveals a fundamental truth about Kavanaugh that many conservatives see as a winning argument; the man does not view himself as a lawmaker or a ruler. His consistency throughout the years comes down to a firm belief in the purpose of separation of powers and a preference for judicial restraint in making decisions that go beyond interpreting the Constitution as it is, rather than how liberals would like it to be.

From a conservative perspective, his personal views become irrelevant as we recognize his dedication to neutral, originalist, and objective judicial restraint. From a progressive perspective, this is a threat to the “social progress” they have unwisely placed in the hands of a court that never should have held such power in the first place. What we see in this report is a fear of a truth being revealed: That all of their victories are hollow in the face of a Supreme Court that functions the way it was meant to.

As a gay man, am I worried that confirming Kavanaugh will bring about an end to my marriage and reinstitute the criminality of my private sex life? No. The reason is simple. Despite the fear, exaggeration and emotional manipulation presented by the LGBT media, I see Kavanaugh as a neutral and principled judge willing to set his personal views aside and defend the Constitution and the purpose of the court.

He has not expressed a desire to undermine my rights, and, contrary to the assertions of the HRC report, I don’t believe any of my civil rights are in jeopardy. The worst that could happen is the power to determine law would be returned to the states where I, as a citizen, have direct influence.

Liberals must recognize that simply holding conservative views is not the same as plotting anti-liberal authoritarian pursuits. All they seem to have is fear, speculation, and a certainty that we will do to them what they freely do to the American people. Regardless, Kavanaugh does not appear to be interested in fulfilling the hysterical worries liberals accuse him of planning.

Grindr Messages Show What Gay People Can Learn From Mike Pence,"“Daddy looking for son.” “Furry bear looking for cub.” “Submissive looking for dominant.” These are just a few of the jarring messages you might see if you open the gay dating app Grindr. Oh, and stay on the app for more than a few minutes, and you’ll likely get sent some unsolicited pictures of male genitalia as well.

I’m a gay, agnostic libertarian, but if I spend too much time on Grindr, the most popular dating app for gay men, I start to think that social conservatives might have a few things right.

For example, basic social values like monogamy and sexual modesty are in large part absent among gay people, while open relationships, three-member “throuples,” and all sorts of unorthodox romantic arrangements are common. A typical scroll through Grindr will earn you invitations to “group sessions,” and you’ll likely encounter several profiles that bear the image of a couple seeking a third.

Go to a gay club with your boyfriend, and you may be approached by other men seeking to join a threesome. Meanwhile, anonymous encounters and late-night hookups are the norm in gay culture, while actual dates and long-term relationships are often an anomaly.

The result of this promiscuity? Nearly 60 percent of American gay men in relationships cheat, while 50 percent of British gays admit to infidelity. Only 10 percent of LGBT people are married, and while that may be partially influenced by the fact that same-sex marriage was only recently legalized in some states, it’s undeniable that many gay people have no interest or success in establishing long-term relationships, let alone starting families.

That’s sad. Studies show that marriage greatly increases lifetime happiness, and many of those gains are also present for long-term relationships. Married people are also healthier, less likely to get heart disease, and more likely to survive cancer. They save money on taxes, insurance, and countless other expenses. Oh, and on average, a married person’s net worth outweighs that of a single person by 77 percent.

Gay people need to take a cue from social conservatives, because what we’re doing now just isn’t working. One mental health expert from Yale dared to be a tad politically incorrect in his evaluation of Grindr culture: “It causes a lot of distress.” As it turns out, rampant sexual promiscuity isn’t good for your physical or mental health.

A survey from HumaneTech found that most Grindr users spent an hour on the app daily, but 77 percent reported feeling unhappy or dissatisfied after its use. It’s not hard to see why. Shallow sexual encounters don’t make anyone feel good in the long-run.

Many gay men report feeling more anxious or depressed after using the app for anonymous hookups. Wouldn’t you feel worse about yourself after sending naked pictures to a stranger, or meeting someone at midnight for a hookup? These behaviors aren’t exclusive to gay people, but they’re undoubtedly more common.

Yet unfortunately, the company behind Grindr isn’t interested in addressing these issues. They’d rather pander to political correctness instead. Grindr recently revealed a “Kindr” initiative, where they will attempt to “fight sexual racism,” by which they mean racial dating preferences. This is clearly an exercise in absurdity. In the absence of ill intention, racial dating preferences are no more racist than preferring men to women is sexist.

Grindr also wants to fight “body shaming” and other alleged offenses. If only the company was as concerned about combatting rampant sexual immorality as they are about punishing people who find physical fitness attractive.

In the face of such nonsense, it’s clear that some of the basic principles behind social conservatism could help gay people. But there’s also no shortage of LGBT-related issues where social conservatives are dead wrong. They’re right to sing the praises of monogamy and celebrate marriage, especially as marriage so closely correlates to financial and social stability—yet they’re wrong on both constitutional and moral grounds when they want to exclude same-sex couples from such an important institution, or otherwise seek to stimigatize homosexuality.

One Slate report found overwhelmingly that when societal acceptance of homosexuality increases, so does monogamy within the gay community. If conservatives really to want to pass their values onto LGBT people, which could be beneficial, they’ll do so much more successfully with an open hand than with a closed mind.

I won’t be declaring myself a devotee of Mike Pence or donating to the Family Research Council anytime soon, but gay men like me can learn a thing or two from the social conservatives we’re so quick to dismiss.

Study Repressed For Finding Trans Kids May Be Social Contagion,"“Rapid-onset gender dysphoria” among teens and young adults may be a social contagion linked with having friends who identify as LGBT, an identity politics peer culture, and an increase in internet use, finds a study out this month from a Brown University professor. The study was quickly yanked from Brown’s news releases after a transgender activist feeding frenzy, and the journal it was published in is reconsidering the publication. There is a parent and researcher-driven petition to stand behind the publication of the first study to look in detail at rapid-onset gender dysphoria.

The petition includes the following graph about gender referrals in the United Kingdom. Anecdotal and news reports, as well as the rapid recent growth in transgender treatment centers, indicates a similar phenomenon inside the United States.

“[T]he parental reports in this study offer important and much-needed preliminary information about a cohort of adolescents, mostly girls, who with no prior history of dysphoria, are requesting irreversible medical interventions, including the potential to impair fertility and future sexual function,” says the petition. “In any other group of children, these grave consequences would be seen as human rights violations unless there was significant and overwhelming evidence these procedures would be beneficial long-term.”

Despite these facts on the ground, Brown issued a statement Tuesday effectively apologizing for publicizing their own professor’s research because, “Brown community members express[ed] concerns that the conclusions of the study could be used to discredit efforts to support transgender youth and invalidate the perspectives of members of the transgender community.”

“The spirit of free inquiry and scholarly debate is central to academic excellence,” said the statement from Bess Marcus, the dean of Brown’s School of Public Health. “At the same time, we believe firmly that it is also incumbent on public health researchers to listen to multiple perspectives and to recognize and articulate the limitations of their work.”

Hm, I wonder if she would worry about “invalidating the perspectives of members of the alternative health community” after a Brown researcher published a study indicating a vaccine is effective and anti-vaxxers went crazy about it on Twitter. Doubtful.

The reason trans activists went nuts is that the study reinforces what plenty of parents, public health experts, and doctors have been saying: Transgenderism looks a lot like a dangerous fad. It’s telling that their response was to demand suppressing the results. It’s also telling that Brown chose to prioritize the unreasonable demands of a tiny minority above the potential well-being of children and the process of scientific inquiry.

How This Study Came About

The study is authored by Lisa Littman, a behavior and social sciences professor at Brown, and an OB-GYN whose publications are mainly in reproductive health and abortion. Here’s the phenomenon that caused her to conduct the study to learn more:

Parents have described clusters of gender dysphoria outbreaks occurring in pre-existing friend groups with multiple or even all members of a friend group becoming gender dysphoric and transgender-identified in a pattern that seems statistically unlikely based on previous research. Parents describe a process of immersion in social media, such as ‘binge-watching’ Youtube transition videos and excessive use of Tumblr, immediately preceding their child becoming gender dysphoric. These descriptions are atypical for the presentation of gender dysphoria described in the research literature…

Littman recruited for the study by posting on the transgender-critical websites 4thWaveNow, Transgender Trend, and YouthTransCriticalProfessionals, seeking parents of adolescents who had quickly come out as transgender. She recruited 256 parents of children ages 11 to 27. They filled out a 90-question survey that took about 30-60 minutes to complete. Eighty percent of their transgender-identifying children were female, and on average the kids came out at age 15.

While the author and any social scientist will tell you the study design has many flaws — self selection and self reporting among them — it is comparable in quality to studies that LGBT activists amplify when it serves their narratives. For example, a recent study that found kids of lesbians had outcomes as good or better than that of married biological parents also had self-selected participants who self-reported outcomes. Even though that had only one-quarter the sample size of Littman’s study, it was widely celebrated and published about in prominent outlets.

Littman found a number of things that make transgender narratives look terrible. For example, she explored the horrifyingly irresponsible lies anonymous internet users frequently offer to confused kids who were apparently free to browse for this information online. The below graph from the study quotes common “advice” transgender activists gave children over these kinds of forums.

It is also notable that 86 percent of the parents who took this survey said they support same-sex relationships and 88 percent “believe trans people deserve the same rights and protections as everyone else.” Similar numbers supported their kids’ decision to adopt opposite-sex hairstyles, clothes, and so forth. Of the children who told their parents they wanted to see a gender therapist, 82 percent took them.

In other words, this is a highly open and supportive sample of parents who are largely fine with cross dressing and non-heterosexuality but not on board with chopping off their daughters’ breasts or giving their sons female hormones. It’s really hard to see how they can be fairly faulted for wanting other options and more thought before rushing to mutilate and sterilize their children. Instead of harming transgender people’s best interests, instead this study amplifies the concerns of people who clearly care deeply about gender dysphoric kids.

Here’s What the Study Found

The study offers insights into how gender dysphoria seems to develop among those who declare it suddenly. Among the children studied, 59 percent identified as heterosexual prior to expressing gender dysphoria. This is a disproportionately high percent of non-heterosexual kids (41 percent), although homosexuality and especially lesbian activity is highly fluid and tends to dissipate, especially for teens and females. Eighty-seven percent of the children studied became gender dysphoric after friends did, after increasing their time online, or both.

Eighty-seven percent of the children studied became gender dysphoric after friends did, after increasing their time online, or both.

None of the young people Littman studied would have met the American Psychiatric Association’s criteria for diagnosing childhood gender dysphoria, the study says. However, a very high rate, 62 percent, had been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder or neurodevelopmental disability before their gender dysphoria began.

Nearly half of these children (48 percent) “experienced a traumatic or stressful event prior to the onset of their gender dysphoria,” the study says, such as parental divorce, a death in the family, a romantic breakup, rape or attempted rape, school bullying, family relocation, or a serious illness. Nearly half (45 percent) had been harming themselves before coming out trans. The parents of most of these children also reported they were bad at handling strong negative emotions.

“The majority of respondents (69.4%) answered that their child had social anxiety during adolescence; 44.3% that their child had difficulty interacting with their peers, and 43.1% that their child had a history of being isolated (not associating with their peers outside of school activities),” says the study. One parent explained that her daughter “had very high expectations that transitioning would solve their problems,” the study says. The parent wrote that the child “discontinued anti- depressant quickly, stopped seeing psychiatrist, began seeing gender therapist, stopped healthy eating. [She] stated ‘none of it’ (minding what she ate and taking her Rx) ‘mattered anymore.’ This was her cure, in her opinion.”

This makes it obvious why transgender activists do not want this information public. It suggests many gender dysphoric young people hit a rough patch in life (or several), have poor or immature coping skills, and got the message from peers, online, or both that transgenderism was a handy, simple explanation for their feelings that also offered instant social acceptance and attention.

High Correlation to Peers Who Promote LGBT Sexuality

The study includes other eye-opening information, such as case studies of several children’s stories. Here are three:

“A 14-year-old natal female and three of her natal female friends were taking group lessons together with a very popular coach. The coach came out as transgender, and, within one year, all four students announced they were also transgender.”

“A 21-year-old natal male who had been academically successful at a prestigious university seemed depressed for about six months. Since concluding that he was transgender, he went on to have a marked decline in his social functioning and has become increasingly angry and hostile to his family. He refuses to move out or look for a job. His entire family, including several members who are very supportive of the transgender community, believe that he is ‘suffering from a mental disorder which has nothing to do with gender.'”

“A 14-year-old natal female and three of her natal female friends are part of a larger friend group that spends much of their time talking about gender and sexuality. The three natal female friends all announced they were trans boys and chose similar masculine names. After spending time with these three friends, the 14-year-old natal female announced that she was also a trans boy.”

The study also describes links between social acceptance and even obsession with alternative sexuality as being a high risk factor for children contracting gender dysphoria:

Parents described intense group dynamics where friend groups praised and supported people who were transgender-identified and ridiculed and maligned non-transgender people. Where popularity status and activities were known, 60.7% of the [children with gender dysphoria in the study] experienced an increased popularity within their friend group when they announced a transgender-identification and 60.0% of the friend groups were known to mock people who were not transgender or LGBTIA (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, or asexual).

The study also may indicate that school “anti-bullying” programs typically created by LGBT activist organizations such as the Human Rights Campaign may help accelerate children identifying as transgender by pushing peers and authority figures to profusely express their support. It also may suggest that Marxist-style identity politics that brand heterosexuality as oppressive increase gender dysphoria. Perhaps this is one reason a 2013 study found that anti-bullying programs actually increase bullying.

‘They are constantly putting down straight, white people for being privileged, dumb and boring.’

“Great increase in popularity among the student body at large. Being trans is a gold star in the eyes of other teens,” wrote one parent on the study response form. Another wrote, “not so much ‘popularity’ increasing as ‘status’ … also she became untouchable in terms of bullying in school as teachers who ignored homophobic bullying …are now all at pains to be hot on the heels of any trans bullying.”

Children who contracted gender dysphoria in the study were highly likely to have peer groups with a culture of directing animosity towards people who are white, straight, and male. “They are constantly putting down straight, white people for being privileged, dumb and boring,” one study participant wrote. Another wrote: “In general, cis-gendered people are considered evil and unsupportive, regardless of their actual views on the topic. To be heterosexual, comfortable with the gender you were assigned at birth, and non-minority places you in the ‘most evil’ of categories with this group of friends.”

The peer groups of rapid-onset gender dysphoric children also routinely mocked family members and adults, the study found, alienating these distressed children from their most likely sources of help. A handful of study participants who heeded their children’s petition to be removed to a different social environment reported the children were much happier and ceased describing themselves as transgender. One of these children “expressed a strong desire to ‘…get out of the culture that if you are [heterosexual], then you are bad or oppressive or clueless.'”

Social Contagion Is a Well-Documented Human Behavior

“The results of the study support the possibility that social contagion, rather than an innate, immutable sense of incongruence between body and mind, may be at work in some of these cases,” says the open letter petitioning Brown to stand behind Littman’s work.

The petition is the work of 4thWaveNow, a networking and information website for gay-friendly parents and researchers concerned about transgender politics. As mentioned above, Littman recruited parents for her study on the site, which trans activists are ridiculously claiming is a “far-right” “hate” site. 4thWaveNow clearly leans politically liberal and strongly supports non-heterosexuality. These are parents who are righteously concerned about manipulating and mutilating children for the sake of a highly politicized narrative that has little real support beyond its ability to create a business and political industry that profits from despair.

We are allowing people to get fame and profit by lying to vulnerable people and facilitating procedures that very likely do more harm than good.

I’m a free market supporter, but I also see that markets function on desire, and not all desires are good. It’s good to desire to mother a child. It’s not good to meet that desire by renting a womb and buying the medical machinery and human parts to make one. It’s good to desire social acceptance and a strong identity. It’s not good to address that desire by pretending to be a male when you are a female, or vice versa. Believing and acting on lies hurts people, often badly.

Rather than blaming the market mechanisms by which people pursue these bad answers to their desires, it’s more appropriate to set boundaries defining what longings are good and not, and what are healthy and morally right ways to satisfy them. Markets cannot do this. This is what a society is for. And because our society is failing in this duty, through things like suppressing the research, discussion, and inquiry that facilitates it, we are allowing people to get fame and profit by lying to vulnerable people and facilitating procedures that very likely do more harm than good.

This is what we call exploitation. It’s an old human story. Social hysterias like the Dutch tulip craze, Salem witch trials, lynchings, buying stock in a mythical America where the streets were paved with gold, and countless other contagions are a persistent feature of human history. Often it is intermixed with buying and selling because where there is desire, there is exchange. People did, and still do, buy and sell human beings. Now we are also buying and selling, mixing and matching human body parts. There ought to be both social and legal limits on things like this, and far better ones than we have now.

Desire drives exchange. Thus it’s big business to create desires for products and services. In so doing, business takes on the social and especially religious function of defining, refining, and directing our desires. The answer is to take that responsibility back for ourselves, and inform our desires, and ensure our children’s desires are formed, with history, research, ethics, religion, and other products of an advanced and successful culture.

The goal should be to minimize harm as much as possible. We do that by thinking before acting, and part of that thinking is talking. Research is also thinking, in a particularly rigorous fashion. This is why trans activists try to suppress talking and thinking. That shows very clearly their true goals are not for bettering human society. It also provides even greater urgency that we refuse to heed their wild, petulant, dangerous demands.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/08/31/explosive-ivy-league-study-repressed-for-finding-transgender-kids-may-be-a-social-contagion/,2018-08-31
California Gay Therapy Bill Dropped After Nationwide Opposition,"I’m a clinical psychologist. I work with men with unwanted same-sex attractions and individuals with a wide range of addictions and traumas. Earlier this year, I shared my professional concerns about California Assembly Bill 2943 with the state legislature through testimony and private meetings.

I am therefore grateful that Assembly member Evan Low dropped AB 2943 on Friday, stating that he wanted to find a more inclusive, common-ground legal solution to abusive therapies. As written, AB 2943 was too far-reaching, would have limited client choices, and risked constitutional freedoms, despite its worthy goal of stopping abusive therapies.

Low and I disagreed on AB 2943, but we agree that gay and lesbian Americans are damaged by therapies that force changes and promise “results.” Many of these same people, however, also feel alienated from other LGBT people simply for exploring the option of heterosexuality.

Ostracized and alone, my clients and others seek an answer that fits their needs. That option is not the destructive and false conversion therapies Low and I oppose, but Reintegrative Therapy, which Low acknowledged in our meeting as distinct from “conversion therapy.” Like all legitimate therapies, Reintegrative Therapy takes place through client-led counseling to bring healing and peace to those who seek it.

Low’s decision to drop AB 2943 shows there is a need for greater distinction between evidence-based therapies and therapies that seek to shame people out of homosexual attractions. The core difference is that real therapies put clients in the driver’s seat. Harmful ones instead put politicians and counselors in charge, inserting their own therapeutic goals and impinging upon client freedom.

Clients describe three non-homophobic reasons for exploring sexual fluidity and heterosexuality. The first is to resolve trauma that resulted from sexual abuse. We sometimes hear this from Catholic men who were abused by clergy.

The second reason is related to deeply held personal beliefs about sexuality. Many of our Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, and Christian clients have this motivation.

Finally, many of our clients had taken on an LGBT identity and, years later, decided that these relationships were unfulfilling. They therefore wish to explore heterosexuality.

The new documentary “Free to Love” demonstrates how clients with these motivations have led themselves toward healthy changes in sexual attractions through counseling. By identifying the foundations for their unwanted sexual attractions, they discovered a heterosexual path. I was proud to be interviewed as part of the documentary, which the Reintegrative Therapy Association commissioned with a skeptical Hollywood filmmaker.

Compassion, healing, a safe space without judgment: these are values that ethical therapists, Low, and all who care about sexual health and resolution put first and foremost. Like Low, I hope all parties can reach an understanding that respects every person’s sexual identity and puts the client, not politicians, in charge of his or her own life goals.

Dr. Joseph Nicolosi Jr. is founder of the Reintegrative Therapy Association, which treats men and women with trauma and sexual addiction. A licensed psychologist, he has 10 years of counseling experience.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/09/06/california-gay-therapy-bill-dropped-nationwide-opposition/,2018-09-06
"No, HuffPo: Dead Children Like Jamel Myles Are Not Gay Martyrs","A strange and desperately tragic Huffington Post headline caught many eyes last month: “Denver Nine-Year-Old Dies By Suicide After Reported Bullying For Being Gay.”

The nine-year-old was Jamel Myles, one of three children being raised by single mom Leia Pierce. Pierce told the media her son privately “came out” to her in the back seat of their car one day, saying “Mom, I’m gay,” while curling up in a ball.

After her affirming reaction, he became more cheerful, excited even. He went shopping with his mom and sisters for fake nails. On the first day of school, he shared his secret with the whole class.

Four days later, Pierce found him dead by hanging in his room. From her oldest daughter, she learned that his classmates had told him to kill himself.

Now Everyone’s a Bully

Other media outlets swiftly weighed in. Billboard collected all in one place Twitter reactions from gay icons like Ellen Page. All of them claimed Myles as a victim of gay oppression and a name that should go down in “LGBT” history. Screenwriter Steven Canals tweeted about the first time he was told to “stop being so gay” in fourth grade: “I didn’t know who I was then. Jamel did. He was gay. And he was proud, until he wasn’t.”

At HuffPo UK, gay activist Jeff Ingold wasted no time in connecting Jamel’s story to Britain’s 30-year-old policies banning local schools from promoting homosexuality. Although the policies were repealed in 2003, Ingold writes ominously that “their shadow looms large,” with some teachers “still unsure of whether they are allowed to teach about LGBT matters at school.”

He stresses the crucial function of “LGBT-inclusive curriculum” in creating a safe atmosphere for students like Jamel. He takes Jamel’s story as a reminder that there is still much work to be done in effecting the cultural change he wants to see.

It’s not just about the kids who told Jamel to kill himself, you see. To LGBT activists writ large, it’s about anyone who might give Jamel any response other than “Of course you’re gay! How could we ever doubt you? What sort of bigot would tell a child who can’t choose his own bedtime that he can’t choose his own sexual identity?” It’s about anyone who might dare to suggest that perhaps prepubescent children don’t need to know about gay sex. Perhaps (gasp) they don’t need state-sponsored sex education at all.

But of course. Everyone’s a bully. And if everyone’s a bully, no one is.

Perniciously False or Trivially True

Ingold’s core assumption that young children are capable of fully mature sexual self-expression is, of course, perniciously false. The truth is that, absent the vocabulary handed to them by our hyper-sexualized culture, young children can’t express themselves sexually, nor should they be able to.

True, a nine-year-old boy might innocently tell his mother, “Mom, I like Sally. She’s pretty.” But the sexual thoughts and feelings that will eventually come with that inclination towards girls like Sally are as yet latent and inchoate. He knows that he really likes Sally, but he knows that he really likes Timmy too. He adores his female math teacher, but also hero-worships his big brother.

What distinguishes these feelings from each other? What separates a crush on a girl from hero-worship of another boy? Young children are not in a position to answer these questions clearly.

As is typical with leftist arguments, when the premises are not perniciously false, they are trivially true. It is, for example, trivially true that children can have interests and personality traits that deviate from peers of their own gender, just as it is trivially true that they can be ruthlessly bullied by those peers as a consequence.

But what does this prove? To the rationally minded, it proves nothing. To the activist, it proves everything. Are you a boy who is more quiet and gentle than the other boys in your class? Do you prefer music or art while they prefer sports? Do you have a flair for dance or musical theater? If you answered “Yes,” you’re probably gay.

But that’s okay! The teachers in your school and celebrities on your TV screen are here to help you discover that you were Born This Way. Thus our culture’s self-anointed mouthpieces prove themselves to have all the nuance, imagination, and insight into human nature of a playground bully. Oh, the irony.

‘No Child Left Behind’

The same plasticity and desire to please that makes children vulnerable to the judgment of their peers also makes them vulnerable to the suggestions of their adult authority figures. In the tweet quoted above, Canals recalls the moment in 1989 when a kid could tease him for “being gay” while his fourth-grade self “didn’t yet know who he was.”

Yet if we were to transport the young Canals from the ’80s to the present, surely he would not lack any vocabulary for his sexual self-expression. The people entrusted with his education and formation would see that he had the full rainbow, as it were. In the sexual revolution, their motto is “No child left behind.”

Ingold laments that, for activists like him, culture is not yet fully made over in their image. On the contrary: they are running away with the culture so fast that even Hollywood struggles to keep up. Consider, for instance, the tepid critical reception for recent indie film “A Kid Like Jake,” about two Brooklyn parents trying to raise their “gender non-conforming” 4-year-old. According to the culture-makers, it’s not propagandistic enough. From the files of “Things That Could Only Be Written In 2018,” an actual quote from an actual review:

It’s more than a little disconcerting to have this child’s fate discussed directly or indirectly without any feedback from the boy himself. Instead, Alex, Greg, and an assortment of other characters speculate about his feelings, his identity, and what he might want, but no one, apparently, thinks to just ask the kid.

“The kid” is four. Oh, we said that already.

As far as Jake’s real-life counterparts are concerned, this reviewer needn’t worry that they will lack adults to exploit them. Even as far back as 2006, six-year-old Jazz Jennings was promptly put on primetime as soon as he announced he was a girl. A book deal followed seven years later.

Jazz’s YouTube show was just one of numerous media influences cited in Brown University’s stunning recent study on the social roots of gender dysphoria in young people. The study provides example after example of children who only announced a desire to transition after immersing themselves in sex-change videos, or mingling with peers who were also experimenting sexually.

Clearly, there is nothing abusive or predatory about grooming 9-year-old Nemis Golden into a drag queen and gay fashion icon.

News reports follow the same pattern, like the one about an eight-year-old girl who announced, “You know I actually have a disease to make me feel like a boy. I’m dead serious! I looked it up on YouTube!”

This is the culture in which Myles was swimming. Is it any surprise that he told his mother he wanted to grow up and “become a YouTube star”? As gay libertarian pundit Chad Felix Greene observed on Twitter apropos of Jamel’s story, 9-year-old kids do not just up and announce they are gay and “proud” out of thin air.

But yes, Milwaukee Pride, please tell us more about how what we really need are more pride festivals and parades. Tell us how you’re doing it for the children, and will keep doing it for the children, so they too can live “out and proud.” Because clearly, there is nothing manipulative about coaching a group of first and second-graders through a pride day promo ad full of catch-phrases they can barely understand, cum R-rated tangent about “how Jodie Foster made me question my sexuality when I was your age.”

Clearly, there is also nothing abusive or predatory about grooming 9-year-old Nemis Golden into a drag queen and gay fashion icon. Nemis calls his alter ego “Lactatia.” His mother says he became passionate about drag after she introduced him to RuPaul’s drag race at age seven. At the end of this video, he gets a surprise visit from Season 6 contender “Vivacious.” “It’s because of people like you that I’m here,” he tells young Nemis. “You are my replacement.”

Where Does Shame Really Belong?

Some might accuse me of letting Jamel’s bullies off the hook. I do nothing of the sort. I merely observe that debauched culture and cruel children are a match made in hell. The former provides dark materials for the latter. We are being told that the question at hand is “How can children like Jamel Myles come out safely?” when the real question is, “How did children like Jamel Myles learn what it means to ‘come out’ in the first place?”

Jamel’s blood is on his bullies’ hands, but they’re not the only ones who contributed to this tragedy. Some blame should be cast on every single media outlet, every single “gay icon” with a platform who is standing on Jamel’s dead body and turning him into a martyr for their sexual cause celebre. These are the people encouraging prepubescent kids to adopt an adult identity and sexuality they can know essentially nothing about, then glamorizing their deaths. They are the ones communicating that lack of instant acceptance is a horrifying, even un-surmountable event. These are clearly dangerous messages to send impressionable kids.

Yet Gay Star News informs us that “Telling kids they are too young to come out makes you the problem.” Greene’s response was swift and unsparing: “Politicizing a rare and extreme tragedy involving child suicide for a political narrative makes *you* the problem.” Still HuffPo and Co. will go on shifting the blame: to those who oppose gay marriage, or oppose gay sex ed in schools, or oppose sex ed in schools. “How dare you?” they say. “Shame on you,” they say.

Senators Refuse To Accept Pro-Gay Statements From Brett Kavanaugh,"I watched nearly all of the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Right away, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley stated clearly that the role of a judge is to rule based on the law regardless of his or her personal view of the outcome.

He also stated that since Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s confirmation hearing in 1993, every nominee has agreed to decline to discuss his or her personal opinion of the “correctness” of any given court precedent. He stated firmly that requesting a judge to do so would essentially be asking for a promise to rule in a certain way in exchange for a confirmation vote, which is both unfair and unethical. With great persistence despite remarkably determined efforts, Kavanaugh honored this standard.

I was struck by how Kavanaugh answered questions related to the various cases and social issues presented to him. He carefully began each response by citing court precedent relevant to the issue. When asked about his decision-making in court cases, he was equally careful to distinguish his personal views from his dedication to judicial independence, following the law as it is written.

This told me exactly what kind of judge he would be, as he had every opportunity to win favor with one side or the other by selectively answering questions. Despite this neutral stance, many senators abjectly refused to recognize the standard in place, often badgering Kavanaugh repeatedly to give his personal opinion. He never once wavered.

What’s Kavanaugh’s Opinion of Obergefell?

One topic that demonstrates senators’ willful defiance of this ground rule and the biased way the media interpreted his answers revolved around LGBT law, specifically same-sex marriage and workplace discrimination law. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) asked, “Can you comment on your personal opinion on whether Obergefell [the case that required governments to grant gay marriage licenses nationwide] was correctly decided? It’s a yes or no. Please.”

Kavanaugh had repeatedly reminded senators that he chose to honor the precedent of previous nominees refusing to give a “thumbs up or down” about any specific case. Instead, he gave what I viewed as a clear response. Kavanaugh replied, “Justice Kennedy wrote, ‘The days of discriminating against gay and lesbian Americans or treating gay and lesbian Americans as inferior in dignity and worth are over.’”

Unsatisfied, Harris asked if he agreed with Kennedy’s words he had quoted. He attempted to reply by stating, “That is the precedent of the Supreme Court agreed with by…”

She interrupted, “Sir, I’m asking your opinion. You’re the nominee right now so it is probative of your ability to serve on the highest court in our land. So I’m asking you a very specific question. Either you’re willing to answer or not. And if you’re not willing to answer it, we can move on. Do you believe Obergefell was correctly decided?” He chose to, again, remind her that as in the cases of previous judges, his personal opinions were simply irrelevant.

What About Firing Gay People?

Sen. Corey Booker (D-NJ) also attempted to obtain a glimpse into the judge’s personal views by asking him a series of morality questions about workplace discrimination. Booker asked if he believed it was wrong to fire someone for being gay. Kavanaugh responded, “Senator, in my workplace I hire people because of their talents and abilities. All Americans…”

Booker interrupted, rephrasing the question to ask if a business had a right to fire someone for being gay. Kavanaugh responded, as had become his custom by this point, that it was inappropriate for him to comment on potential cases he may be involved with, as the issue is currently pending in many cases.

Booker said many gay Americans fear that if Kavanaugh were to be confirmed, their marriages might be nullified. He also argued that many states still allow, or more correctly do not explicitly ban, workplace discrimination against LGBT people.

Despite Booker once again asking for the judge’s personal opinion on the matter, Kavanaugh responded by stating that Congress had the power to make these legal concerns more clear, before being cut off. After a few more pressing questions on how he personally and morally viewed same-sex marriage, Kavanaugh stated firmly, despite Booker’s continued interruptions, “I apply the law, the law of the Supreme Court. The law of the land protects that right as dictated by the Supreme Court.”

Reaffirming Pro-Gay Precedent Wasn’t Enough for Them

Harris and Booker were attempting to obtain a very specific answer from the judge and despite his extremely clear responses, they grew frustrated and hostile. Harris tweeted an article by the LGBT media site The Advocate, titled “Kamala Harris Stumps Brett Kavanaugh with Marriage Equality Question,” in which she commented, “Obergefell v. Hodges legalized same-sex marriage across the country and was one of the great moments in the history of the Supreme Court. Despite repeated questioning, Kavanaugh refused to say it was correctly decided.”

Chad Griffin, president of the LGBT-advocacy Human Rights Campaign, tweeted, “In which Kavanaugh: -Refuses to state his opinion on marriage equality -Refuses to say if non-discrimination protections apply to LGBTQ people -Admits role in Bush admin attempt to ban marriage equality (but docs aren’t public) Thank you @SenBooker!” Kavanaugh had not admitted a role in the Bush administration discussion, however, instead simply stating he was aware of the discussion at the time.

Lambda Legal, the oldest LGBT legal advocacy organization, tweeted about Sen. Chris Coons’ (D-DE) questions, “Senator @ChrisCoons is expertly grilling #Kavanaugh on abortion, contraception, same-sex relationships and #MarriageEquality. Kavanaugh invokes all of the #LGBTQ-related decisions written by his precedent, Justice Kennedy. But, he cannot give his own opinion. Naturally.”

Bringing the point to the very center of the discussion, Eugene Scott, writing in the Washington Post, expressed, “The future is not clear for gay citizens’ ability to share the marriage rights that straight Americans do. Kavanaugh’s non-answer likely reaffirmed the fears of gay Americans and encouraged the conservative Christians who backed Trump with the hope that he would deliver the courts to them.”

If You Don’t Voice Support, You’re Against Us

In all this it seems clear the senators and the media intentionally viewed Kavanaugh’s refusal to discuss his personal opinions as validation of their prejudicial assumption of those opinions. Their standard seemed to be that if Kavanaugh did not explicitly praise a decision, he must therefore deeply oppose it, and would work to overturn it once confirmed. But I view the situation differently.

Not only did Kavanaugh repeatedly express a clear and consistent view of equality under the law for all Americans in judicial philosophy, the Constitution, and his own practice, he explicitly cited Supreme Court precedent that validated this view. At one point, when Harris was repeatedly questioning him on Obergefell, Kavanaugh restated the Justice Kennedy quote on LGBT rights, with intentional emphasis.

Viewed objectively, his message was obvious. He looks to precedent for guidance on legal decision-making and he clearly cited precedent that affirmed everything the senators were demanding of him. They were simply too blinded by prejudice to see it.

Change the Laws, Don’t Manipulate the Courts

As brilliantly argued by Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) on the Senate giving power to the Supreme Court, “This transfer of power means people yearn for a place where politics can be done, and when we don’t do a lot of big political debate here, people transfer it to the Supreme Court. And that’s why the Supreme Court is increasingly a substitute political battleground for America.”

It is very apparent Kavanaugh feels so strongly on the equality of all Americans that he insisted on stating so multiple times throughout his hearing.

The Left has come to depend on the Supreme Court to provide it validation and legal protection. As such, they understandably become overwhelmed with anxiety at any change they feel they have no control over. Unfortunately, the media amplifies and perpetuates this fear. We can see that reflected in the screaming protesters and emotionally passionate lawmakers seemingly unaware of their power to introduce the solutions they believe are so necessary.

Kavanaugh did not profess loyalty to any group, ideology, or cause. He simply confirmed his commitment to being an independent judge who separates himself from his duties under the law. While identity politics advocates interpret this to be a warning sign of opposition, I view it as a sign of neutrality and fairness. That’s all I want in a judge of any kind, especially a Supreme Court justice.

More to the point, everything LGBT advocates celebrate from the court could be handled by the very lawmakers they look to for saving them by voting “No” on Kavanaugh’s confirmation. It is very apparent Kavanaugh feels so strongly on the equality of all Americans that he insisted on stating so multiple times throughout his hearing. I am saddened and frustrated that LGBT advocates and the Democrats prefer dramatic grandstanding over that simple and uncontroversial truth.

6 Overhyped Summer News Stories From LGBT Media Outlets,"The media often exploit modern readers’ short attention span by using eye-popping headlines that fail to represent the context of the story. Sadly, this practice seems to be growing in popularity throughout LGBT media and advocacy groups. One of the major consequences of this exploitation is emotionally manipulating and even entirely misleading LGBT people who rely on these sources.

Here is a closer look at the accuracy of several summer LGBT headlines to illustrate what is a constant trend.

“New GOP bill would ban flying of Pride flag at U.S. embassies” —Washington Blade

This article begins by asserting “A Republican lawmaker in the U.S. House has introduced legislation that appears to be aimed at barring U.S. embassies from flying the Pride flag in recognition of the LGBT community.”

Only further into the article does the author clarify that the lawmaker introduced the bill to “prohibit the flying of any flag other than the United States flag over United States diplomatic and consular posts, and for other purposes.”

Even though the article quotes the American Civil Liberties Union admitting that they do not believe the rainbow flag is specifically targeted, they continue on to assert that they are certain a desire to prohibit the rainbow flag is the motivation behind the “ridiculous” new law.

In truth, Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.), the bill’s sponsor, defended the bill by arguing, “the United States flag is the single greatest symbol of freedom the world has ever known, and there’s no reason for anything but Old Glory to be flying over our embassies and posts around the globe.” No anti-LGBT motivation appears to be involved.

“Teen Excels High School Despite Being Kicked Out by Parents After Learning He was Gay” — Attitude UK

Seth Owen is an 18-year-old high school co-valedictorian who recently became an LGBT symbol of resistance to bigotry and a symbol of hope for young people seeking to escape their unaccepting families.

The story, however, is not as straightforward as the headline would have readers believe.

Owen was 15 years old when his father discovered images on Owen’s phone that strongly indicated the young man was gay. After confronting Owen about the images, his parents sent him to a counselor, an action that Owen believed was intended to “make” him straight. The counseling sessions didn’t last long, and Owen continued living with his parents for several years while attending school, holding down part-time jobs, and participating in many extracurricular activities.

When he was 18 years old, Owen and his father got into a dispute over the family policy of attending church. Owen disapproved of the conservative views his parents’ Baptist church expressed, and no longer wished to attend. His father told Owen either he would attend church with everyone in the family or need to move out. Owen chose the latter, moving in with friends.

“Woman breaks into gay man’s home, forces him to watch her perform sex act as ‘example’ of how to ‘behave’” — Queerty

While this article initially appears to be a report about a homophobic couple attempting to shame a gay man in a disturbing manner, the actual story is far more serious.

The incident occurred in New Zealand in 2016 when a woman, Laura Jean Landon, along with two unnamed men, used the app Grindr to convince a gay man to meet them, under the false impression he would be hooking up with another gay man.

The three rang his doorbell and immediately began threatening him with a bat and a gun. They shouted homophobic slurs, broke his belongings, and engaged in sexual acts in front of him. They also sexually assaulted the victim, forcing him to perform oral sex on both male attackers. The attackers then ransacked his home and stole his credit cards, cash, jewelry, even his car.

Landon was sentenced to four and half years in prison for participating in the assault. The other two assailants were not mentioned.

Strangely, rather than emphasizing the seriousness of this violent crime , the publication chose the far more ridiculous angle of headlining a single homophobic act fitting a narrative of ignorance and bigotry.

“DOJ touts anti-LGBT views, task force at ‘religious freedom’ summit” — Washington Blade

On July 30, 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the creation of the Religious Liberty Task Force, designed to protect the religious freedom of all Americans.

The article in question, however, failed to indicate how the DOJ had ”touted” anti-LGBT views. Instead, it merely mentions one example Sessions listed in reference to the Supreme Courtruling on the Masterpiece Cake Shop. The majority of the article goes on to speculate that the message behind the speech is one of unhindered anti-LGBT discrimination under the guise of religious freedom.

However, Sessions’ actual statement describing the new task force reads, “the Task Force will help the Department fully implement our religious liberty guidance by ensuring that all Justice Department components are upholding that guidance in the cases they bring and defend, the arguments they make in court, the policies and regulations they adopt, and how we conduct our operations. That includes making sure that our employees know their duties to accommodate people of faith.” No LGBT content was mentioned, and certainly nothing that could be described as advocating “anti-LGBT views.”

“The Religious Right Appears Intent On Criminalizing Gay Sex Again” — Huffington Post

Written by Michelangelo Signorile, editor-at-large of Huffington Post’s “Queer Voices,” this piece largely consists of speculation that Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court would not only lead to the end of same-sex marriage, it also would allow states to once again ban sodomy.

Signorile made a similar prediction following Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the high court. The core of his argument is based on comments by several Christian conservative leaders, some more than a decade old, regarding the nature of homosexuality and the influence of legally recognizing homosexual behaviors.

Signorile concludes that, because many Christian conservative leaders have influence over this administration, support constitutional originalism, and have historically disapproved of efforts to legalize same-sex marriage or decriminalize sodomy, gay Americans’ sexual freedom is directly at risk.

Signorile asserts, “None of us should believe that even the legality of gay sex, like abortion, can’t be thrown back to the states ― many of which, in the political grip of hard-line religious conservatives, would ban it in a heartbeat.”

In truth, no one today is even hinting at such an agenda, which appears to be purely the work of the author’s paranoia and imagination.

“The State Department is retroactively revoking passports for trans citizens” — LGBTQ Nation

This particular story is notable because, within a day or so of publication, the title of the article was changed to read “Advocates say fears about trans people’s passports are overblown.” Nevertheless, the original tweet and URL still reflected the above initial headline.

The basis of this accusation involves two transgender women who claimed to their passport renewals were denied because of their gender identity.

In the first case, Gender Justice League Executive Director Danni Askini argued that efforts to renew a 10-year passport failed due to the U.S. government’s request for proof of citizenship documents and evidence of transition. Askini tweeted, “Today I was denied a renewal of my US Passport and told I would need to get a judge to unseal child welfare records from Foster care in order to ‘prove’ my US Citizenship. Despite having had all ‘Female’ ID since 1999, they are now demanding ‘Proof of Transition’ for the 1st time.”

Claiming to be seeking asylum in either Sweden or Canada, due to fear arising from the anti-trans violence in Seattle, Washington, as well as persecution from the U.S. government on account of efforts on behalf of gender advocacy, Askini determined the passport issue was intentional discrimination.

More likely the problem is that, to obtain a 10-year passport, one must provide all documentation, including an original birth certificate and, as Askini underwent the effort of legal gender change, medical documentation of any procedures would be required.

The second example is similar to the first. Janus Rose received a phone call noting a gender marker error noted by the passport processing center. Rose was told that the medical documentation supplied was insufficient to back up a change on a passport gender marker.

The National Center for Transgender Equality later clarified, “All of the incidents we have seen involved unusual circumstances and bureaucratic mistakes by the passport agency and have caused very unfortunate hardship and anxiety for our community members. Please note, the longstanding passport gender marker policy has not changed.”

The Need for Honest Reporting

As always, when dealing with people who believe they are routinely targeted for violence, hatred, and even government oppression, accuracy is extremely important. LGBT people deserve honest reporting, not exaggerated narratives designed to inspire fear, resentment, and anger.

Many gay people may never read beyond a headline that simply confirm their fears and prejudices. This can lead to political and social activism that simply do not reflect truth. A political movement should not have to rely on emotional outrage from truly fake news to be successful.

It’s Time For The Left To Stop Idolizing Oscar Wilde. He’s A Pervert,"Warning: this article contains explicit content.

I’ve always been a fan of Oscar Wilde. As well as being a great servant of the English language, he was iconoclastic, flamboyant, and brave. In the 21st century, he is just as well known for his famous witticisms as he is for his famous works, including “The Picture of Dorian Gray” and “The Importance of Being Earnest.”

Most people are generally aware that Wilde fell in love with the young undergraduate Lord Alfred “Bosie” Douglas, and that the pair maintained a relationship until Wilde’s trial and eventual imprisonment for homosexual offences. What most people don’t know about is Wilde’s pattern of sexual behavior in middle age.

This icon, at the height of his fame, took advantage of his wealth and status to solicit, groom, and harass young men and teenage boys, whose willingness as sexual partners was ambiguous at best. In the age of the Me Too movement, and with the dust having settled after the downfall of Kevin Spacey, Wilde is overdue for a re-evaluation.

We’re Re-Evaluating Everyone, and It’s Oscar Wilde’s Turn

To a great extent, Wilde has been shielded from criticism. He has often, quite fairly, been judged a victim of Victorian hypocrisy. Some make a historical relativist argument, cautioning against taking things out of context and judging Wilde’s actions by our own standards.

Since homosexuality scarcely existed in Wilde’s time as a category to be reviled, they argue, there were no rules or legal standards of behavior for consent. LGBT culture was unfixed and undefined, and therefore Wilde should be given a little more leeway in how we assess his behavior. Bosie’s father, Lord Queensbury, was a brute, a two-dimensional antagonist, whose escalating harassment of Wilde and Bosie renders them easily sympathetic. Wilde’s shocking downfall is often viewed as more than enough suffering, and casts him as a martyr for his sexuality.

In jail, Wilde wrote “De Profundis” (translated as “From the Depths”), a confessional work in which he castigates himself for his decadent behavior, and for squandering much of his talent. In the wake of his fall from grace, this seemed like sufficient self-reflection and an atonement of sorts.

Perhaps most importantly, Wilde has, for several generations, been a necessary icon for LGBT people: too significant, too ideal, regarded too reverentially for his reputation to face any serious challenge. But the culture has changed in two significant ways, which necessitate a far more negative assessment of Wilde, to the point we can still appreciate him as an artist, but with far less warmth and admiration for him as a person.

In the second half of the 20th century, when LGBT as a category was fighting for recognition, there were not many clear LGBT cultural icons to draw on for a sense of empowerment, so Wilde was of profound importance. But in our more tolerant age, when a large number of historical figures have been revealed as queer, and modern popular culture is full of openly gay celebrities and intellectuals, the weight of reliance on Wilde is far less, and there is greater license to examine him more critically.

Secondly, in the wake of the Me Too movement, particularly Spacey’s downfall, Wilde looks distinctly dubious—by the standards of decency and behavior both in our age, and in his own.

What Oscar Wilde Did Was Reprehensible

The object of Wilde’s first homosexual liaison was Robbie Ross. Ross moved in with Wilde and his wife, Constance, while he was cramming to get into Cambridge. The situation was not uncommon in the world the Wildes inhabited. What was, and is, contentious, is that Wilde’s sexual relationship with Ross began when Wilde was a 33-year-old man, and Ross was a 17-year-old school boy.

“Bosie” Douglass also introduced Wilde to young male sex workers: tough youngsters around Piccadilly Circus, and a circle of “renters.” Wilde didn’t exclusively seek teenagers, but his pattern indicates he preferred them to grown men when he had the choice.

Many of these renters were later witnesses in Wilde’s trial for indecency. In many published accounts of the Wilde trials, the rent boys have been dismissed as rough trade whose statements are unreliable. But three boys gave statements who were not prostitutes—Walter Grainger, Edward Shelley, and Alphonse Conway—and their stories make uncomfortable reading.

Grainger was a 16-year-old servant in the house where Wilde stayed during his visits to Oxford. During Wilde’s trial, Grainger testified that Wilde “placed his penis between my legs and satisfied himself.” Grainger went on to testify that while he was sleeping one night, Wilde woke him and “worked me up with his hand and made me spend into his mouth.” Wilde then told Grainger he would be in “very serious trouble” if anyone found out about their private liaisons.

Defense attorney Edward Carson asked Wilde if he had ever kissed Grainger, and Wilde replied, “Oh, no, never in my life… he was a peculiarly plain boy… his appearance was so very unfortunately—very ugly—I mean—I pitied him for it.” Given how Wilde had used Grainger, his flippant answer seems especially cruel. It was the turning point of the whole libel case since it implied that if Grainger were handsome, Wilde would happily have kissed him.

Wilde was 39 when he met and seduced Conway, a boy of 16, during a six-week family holiday to Worthing. When Queensberry’s detectives tracked Conway down the following year, he gave a statement saying that Wilde had touched him inappropriately, and taken him into his bedroom two or three times, where the pair had stripped and lain in bed together; that Wilde had masturbated him on a walk; and, finally, on a trip to Brighton, “used his mouth” on him.

Wilde additionally attempted to court Fred Atkins, a (comparatively older) 20-year-old. Wilde invited Atkins to Paris to serve as his secretary, but Atkins said the job only entailed “writing out… half a page of a manuscript, which took about 10 minutes.” Atkins said Wilde spent the rest of their time together “making improper proposals.”

Around this time, Wilde became involved with another 16-year-old, who had been brought into London from Bruges to be installed in the Albermarle Hotel. According to Oscar Browning, a contemporary of Wilde, “On Saturday, the boy slept with Douglas; on Sunday he slept with Oscar. On Monday he slept with a woman at Douglas’s expense.”

The Albermarle Hotel was also where Wilde invited another boy, 18-year-old Edward Shelley, to dine with him. Shelley later testified: “I had whisky and soda and smoked cigarettes in Mr. Wilde’s sitting room. Mr. Wilde said, ‘Will you come into my bedroom?’ I did not know what he meant. As I went into the room Mr. Wilde kissed me. He also put his arms round me. I had been taking a lot of wine. I felt insulted, degraded, and objected vigorously.”

This Behavior Caused Kevin Spacey’s Fall from Grace

How dissimilar is this pattern of behavior from Spacey’s? For instance, of the 15 accusers who came out against him, one told the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire that Spacey tried to seduce him at his New York apartment when he was 17. The complainant said Spacey asked him to share his bed, but he slept on the sofa, then woke up with the actor’s arms around him: “I was uncomfortable at best, traumatized at worst.”

‘I was uncomfortable at best, traumatized at worst.’

Another accuser, a 16-year-old theater usher when Spacey was appearing in a play, said Spacey invited him and a male friend to his apartment to watch a movie. Instead, Spacey allegedly gave them cocktails and played pornography on the TV. “He knew that I was in high school. It was pretty clear,” the young man said. “It’s not like I was pretending to be an older, cooler person.”

Wilde has the moral fig-leaf of financial transactions sometimes, but in many of the other instances, the teenagers convey, in their testimony, a similar sense of discomfit and disillusionment at being taken advantage of.

One of Spacey’s accusers alleges that he was 14 when he and Spacey first entered sexual relations. Margaret Cotta, a chambermaid at the Savoy Hotel, testified at Wilde’s trial that while Wilde’s lover Alfred Douglas was visiting, she discovered a 14-year-old boy in Wilde’s bed.

Cotta said Wilde’s sheets “were always in a most disgusting state…with traces of Vaseline, soil and semen.” Cotta later revised her testimony, suggesting the boy may have been slightly older, but this impression of a young teen in then middle-aged Wilde’s hotel suite is not a pleasant one.

Oh, and Oscar Wilde Was Also a Sex Tourist

Wilde and Bosie traveled abroad, to countries like Italy and Algeria, where homosexual liaisons between English speakers and local youth were known to flourish. It’s what others have called the seduction of the Orient and the Mediterranean, and what these days is referred to, rather less eloquently, as international sex tourism. In effect, these countries were the South East Asia of their time, where affluent Westerners would solicit deprived or uneducated youngsters in seedy, unregulated contexts.

In Algiers in 1895, Wilde procured for fellow writer Andre Gide a flute-playing Arab boy, primarily to amuse himself and Lord Alfred Douglas. As Gide climbed into a carriage with the boy, fidgeting and procrastinating, Wilde looked on, triumphant.

The nearly 46-year-old playwright had an affair with a 15-year-old while he lived in Sicily during the last seven months of his life.

According to “Selected Letters of Oscar Wilde,” the nearly 46-year-old playwright had an affair with a 15-year-old while he lived in Sicily during the last seven months of his life. Wilde wrote a letter detailing his relationship with Giuseppe Loverde. He said of the boy, “Fifteen and most sweet… He said he never would [forget me]: and indeed, I don’t think he will, for every day I kissed him behind the high altar.” Bosie and Wilde shared most of their “lovers,” and Oscar, during this time, wrote of Bosie being devoted to “a dreadful little ruffian aged 14.”

Even Wilde’s celebrated defense of “the love that dare not speak its name” as “a great affection of an elder for a younger man” now strikes us as skewed and pretentious. Wilde takes the Hellenic ideal of elder mentors aesthetically appreciating younger men in ancient Greece, and equates it with sordid pickups of teenagers. His were superficial liaisons with no intellectual or mentoring aspects, adolescents to be enjoyed and discarded.

Declaring his “love that dare not speak its name” in the hope that posterity, a more enlightened age, will see him proven right isn’t an act of noble martyrdom. The modern age should see through this vainglorious rhetoric, and sympathize with the teenage boys whose circumstances, and experiences with Wilde, may not have been as “greatly affectionate” nor a re-enactment of the noble practices of the classical age as Wilde would have us believe.

I’ll always appreciate Wilde as an artist. I’ve seen “The Importance of Being Earnest” half-a-dozen times, and I’ll probably see it at least that many again. But Wilde as a person? Nope.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/09/18/time-left-stop-idolizing-oscar-wilde-hes-pervert/,2018-09-18
Trying To Make Bert And Ernie Gay Makes LGBT Activists Look Insecure,"Former Sesame Street writer Mark Saltzman, in an interview with Queerty, said “without a huge agenda” he wrote Bert and Ernie as gay, based on his own life. He added, “I don’t think I’d know how else to write them, but as a loving couple.” The way in which media, including social media, ran with the story may be more interesting than Saltzman’s opinion.

After all, Sesame Workshop, the educational group that produces the show, issued a denial: “As we have always said, Bert and Ernie are best friends. They were created to teach preschoolers that people can be good friends with those who are very different from themselves. Even though they are identified as male characters and possess many human traits and characteristics (as most Sesame Street Muppets do), they remain puppets, and do not have a sexual orientation.”

The statement was virtually identical to the 2013 statement issued in response to a cover of The New Yorker suggesting the two longtime friends were in a relationship, as well as the 2011 statement issued after online petitions demanded the pair get married. This position seems fairly clear, if more polite than the formulation used in 2010 and as far back as 1994: “They are not gay, they are not straight, they are puppets. They don’t exist below the waist.”

Indeed, if Snopes is to be believed on this topic, speculation on the sexuality of Bert and Ernie dates as far back as 1980, even before Saltzman wrote for the show. What has changed is the underlying motivation for speculation that has been debunked repeatedly over decades.

Once upon a time, the idea that Bert and Ernie were not merely roommates but shacking up was borne of immature humor that would be condemned in many quarters today as rooted in latent—or patent—homophobia. It was a sort of teenage transgression like the idea that Batman and Robin were gay.

But just as jokes about the Dynamic Duo later gave rise to the parody of The Ambiguously Gay Duo, who were gay (or not), Bert and Ernie would be the subject of similar meta-comedy. In Avenue Q, a Sesame Street pastiche which became one of the longest running musicals in Broadway history, there is a pair of puppets named Rod and Nicky.

The latter’s suspicions of the former’s sexuality (in the song “If You Were Gay“) leads to conflict, even though Nicky is proven correct. These two ultimately reconcile, but their relationship is not sexual. The raging dumpster fire of social media, spurred on by traditional media, cannot even manage the “nuance” of Avenue Q.

Instead, the Workshop’s traditional statement met claims of a double-standard, citing the seemingly heterosexual if trans-species relationship between Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy. For some reason, there are people who cannot distinguish between Sesame Street and The Muppet Show (and associated movies)—different products created with different purposes—simply because Kermit appears in both (a decision almost certainly more commercial than artistic). One can only imagine how blown these minds would be if they were ever shown the Muppets’ short-lived run on the first season of “Saturday Night Live.”

Indeed, Frank Oz, the Muppeteer who created Bert, received similar blowback after taking to Twitter on the subject:

It seems Mr. Mark Saltzman was asked if Bert & Ernie are gay. It's fine that he feels they are. They're not, of course. But why that question? Does it really matter? Why the need to define people as only gay? There's much more to a human being than just straightness or gayness. — Frank Oz (@TheFrankOzJam) September 18, 2018

A long discussion ensued, complete with Muppet fans demanding he accept their interpretation of the characters he created and implying his simple response was motivated by disgust for LGBTQ people. These attacks seem baseless; Oz directed the gay-friendly “In and Out” back in 1997.

Nevertheless, this sort of backlash is increasingly common. Marvel Comics creator Stan Lee faced similar online attacks for opining that Peter Parker (the original Spider-Man) should remain a straight white man, while having no objection to creating new, more diverse characters.

So the imposition of homosexuality upon fictional characters, once the province of sexually insecure teenagers, has now become the bailiwick of the sort of identitarians who would have been the target of the first group in decades past.

The easy explanation for this strange evolution is the desire for representation in the popular culture. It is easy to see why movies like “Wonder Woman,” “Black Panther,” and “Crazy Rich Asians” become not merely successful, but phenomena: less-represented demographics understandably like seeing people who look like them get the validation of big-screen projects.

Of course, the movies still have to be good, as the unfortunate female “Ghostbusters” reboot demonstrated. And perhaps we will eventually get past the psychological demand for representation, but we are not there today.

Yet the representation rationale seems a bit strained in the context of gay and lesbian characters on television in the 21st century. In the course of a few decades, we have seen such representation go from the cutting edge to the merely titillating to relatively commonplace. If LGBTQ people are looking for role models, they are no longer in short supply.

What seems to be happening now is a form of reverse cultural appropriation, driven by technological progress. The information age has brought us a fractured cultural landscape. The monocultural spaces that existed before the internet became ubiquitous are increasingly difficult to find.

As a result, preexisting intellectual properties with brand awareness transcending our personal interests have become far more valuable. It is a large part of why Hollywood circles around comic books, videogames, remakes, reboots, reimaginings and the like.

In this environment, despite a cultural emphasis on diversity and multiculturalism, it is perhaps not surprising that previously unrepresented groups would like to stake their claims to older, monocultural icons. But sometimes, a Muppet is just here to teach kids about the ABCs, not the LGBTQs.

"If Activists Cared About Gay People, They Wouldn't Target Christians","“Do you have a moment to talk about the battle for gay equality?” an activist asked me on the streets of Washington, D.C. in mid-July.

Thoughts flashed through my head of the gay people executed in Middle Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia, and the ongoing detainment, starvation, and shock torture of gay men in Chechnya, Russia. A gay man myself, I felt compelled to stop and hear the campaigner out. The activist worked for the liberal-leaning LGBT Human Rights Campaign and, for the next 10 minutes, he explained the ongoing assault on my rights here in America—oppression I hadn’t noticed.

His elevator pitch focused on supposedly tyrannical “bathroom bills” in some states that require transgender people to use accommodations corresponding to their biological sex. He then touched on the recent Supreme Court case Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. He spoke of a terrifying future in which religious business owners may not be forced to bake cakes for gay weddings or otherwise violate their deeply held beliefs.

The activist went on to say how, in some states, Catholic adoption charities are allowed to turn away gay parents due to their religious beliefs. He insisted that this should be illegal, even though there’s no shortage of other charities open to LGBT parents who want to adopt. I walked away wondering how anyone could consider this a crisis.

This encounter came to mind on Sept. 6, when I heard the news that India’s formal ban on gay sex was struck down by the Indian Supreme Court, and properly declared “indefensible.” Under these archaic rules, roughly 2,000 people a year were prosecuted for so-called “unnatural” sex, even when between consenting adults. Regardless of anyone’s religious views on homosexuality and morality, there’s no question that this ruling was an enormous win for individual liberty.

As this more recent story quickly faded from the news cycle, I was left with a chilling realization: The activist left in America is hardly focused on the actual atrocities gay people face around the globe. Instead, they’re much more concerned with cudgeling Christian conservatives into obedience and virtue-signaling to their far-left allies.

It’s not that they don’t care at all about international tragedies, but others issues are simply more politically expedient. Small incidents become acts of inhumanity, and hyperbole the perfect tool for winning sympathetic voters to your side.

Consider the Masterpiece Cakeshop controversy. After the Supreme Court ruled in the religious baker’s favor, some members of the liberal media melted down. CNN Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin called the ruling an “invitation to discriminate” and invoked Jim Crow-era imagery in his fearmongering on-air response.

An opinion writer at The New York Times insisted it was now time to “change the Constitution,” and another New York Times writer called the religious motives behind decisions like Masterpiece “one of the chief reasons for discrimination, slaughter and genocide.” With support for LGBT rights rising, there’s no better way to whip up the Democratic base for the midterm election than to make a mountain out of a wedding cake.

Yet where is the left’s outrage for the LGBT people stabbed to death with machetes in Bangladesh? Why are there so few CNN and MSNBC segments about the gay people killed in sub-Saharan Africa? Instead, the liberal media chooses to focus on things more politically salient: The porn-star-lawyer turned anti-Trump activist, Michael Avenatti, has appeared on both networks over 100 times since March to talk about “Stormy Daniels” or otherwise attack the president. Meanwhile, it seems there are more op-eds in The New York Times about wedding cake controversies than about the coordinated detainment and torture of gays in Chechnya.

The sad reality is that true gay rights causes may just not be politically sexy enough for left-wing activists and media figures. According to Amnesty International, “Same-sex sexual activity is a crime in 72 countries, and can get you a death sentence in eight countries, including Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen.” It’s not that the left entirely ignores these international atrocities, but their lack of meaningful attention to these issues is nothing short of appalling. In fact, it calls into question the sincerity of the Democratic establishment’s so-called “LGBT rights” advocates.

Both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton ran on anti-gay marriage platforms in 2008. But as public opinion shifted toward supporting it, both candidates adopted starkly different positions in their 2012 and 2016 campaigns—pure coincidence, I’m sure. Clinton, who opposed same-sex marriage until 2012, declared in 2013 that “gay rights are human rights.”

But she still accepted $10 million for her allegedly charitable Clinton Foundation from the leaders of Saudi Arabia. The fact that they give gay people the death penalty was evidently of no concern to her, or her supporters. Beyond that, Obama’s infamous Iran deal gave the Iranian government billions of dollars and loosened economic sanctions previously levied against the country. The regime’s routine executions of gay men and criminalizing of gay sex were apparently irrelevant to Obama’s ambitions.

Herein lies the fundamental problem with the left’s stance on LGBT issues. The imagery of “gay rights” is oft-invoked to support liberal and relatively frivolous issues like bathroom bills or cake-baking, or progressive politicians who are actually ambivalent toward LGBT Americans. Yet the “fight for gay rights” is rarely invoked to address genuine injustices, so the words lose their power. This makes us apathetic toward actual instances of atrocities occurring internationally everyday—and for that, the left is to blame.

To me, the real assault on gay rights isn’t coming from Christian business owners who wish to abide by their sincere religious beliefs, or laws that dictate bathroom rules. Instead, it’s coming from a left-wing elite so determined to use their so-called support for the LGBT community to pursue the liberal agenda that they obfuscate the tragedies that make the term “gay rights” so necessary in the first place.

Why The Visa Policy Liberals Are Bashing Is A Win For Gay People,"The Trump administration has discontinued an Obama-era policy that granted diplomatic visas to the domestic partners of foreign diplomats to the United States, regardless of whether they are same-sex or opposite-sex. Instead, now that same-sex marriage is legal in the United States, the State Department will require those diplomats to marry in order for their partners to be eligible for diplomatic visas.

Democrats, LGBT rights organizations, and the news media immediately framed the decision as an attack on gay people, bandying headlines such as, “Trump Administration Will No Longer Grant Visas to Same-Sex Partners of Diplomats.” The Human Rights Campaign called it an “unconscionable, needless attack.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the change “cruel and discriminatory.”

These attacks misrepresent the State Department’s new policy. Far from discriminating against gay people, it is actually designed to benefit gay American diplomats abroad and to promote gay rights across the globe.

Diplomatic visas clothe the bearer in immense privileges. Once in the United States, diplomatic visa holders hold diplomatic immunity. Depending on the position, they are immune from arrest or detention, they generally cannot be sued or criminally prosecuted, they cannot be searched, and they are exempt from customs duties and most taxes.

The policy at issue was created in 2009, when then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton directed the State Department to issue diplomatic visas to same-sex domestic partners of foreign diplomats in the United States and to formally ask foreign countries to issue reciprocal visas for same-sex domestic partners of American diplomats. After the Supreme Court’s Obergefell decision in 2015, Secretary of State John Kerry announced that domestic partner benefits for American diplomats would be phased out.

Under the Trump administration, promotion of LGBT rights around the world has remained one of the State Department’s priorities. Despite eliminating dozens of other programs, it kept the “gay rights envoy” position, and secretaries Rex Tillerson and Mike Pompeo each recognized LGBT Pride Month. Ambassador Nikki Haley condemned discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and decried the kidnapping, torture, and murder of gay men in Chechnya.

Unfortunately for American foreign service officers, while the United States grants visas for same-sex spouses of foreign diplomats, only a small number of countries extend the reciprocal diplomatic privileges and immunities to American diplomats’ same-sex spouses or partners. The president of Gays and Lesbians in Foreign Affairs Agencies (GLIFAA) explained in 2014: “The problem is not here – it’s in the foreign governments. … we find retrenchment in some of the rest of the world that is making it harder for an LGBT family in the Foreign Service to serve successfully overseas.”

This week’s policy shift is actually an exercise in diplomatic “soft power” in favor of gay rights. By refusing to grant diplomatic visas to same-sex partners of foreign diplomats, the United States communicates to their home countries that they should allow their gay diplomats to marry. If they don’t, they will need to ask for exceptions to the rule or apply for inferior, non-diplomatic visas, which reflect the inferior legal status they grant to their own diplomats.

Thus, this policy forces those countries to face the awkward consequences of their anti-gay policies. It also gives the State Department leverage it can use to secure visas for the same-sex spouses of its own diplomats.

The new policy is not discriminatory toward gay diplomats. Instead, it establishes equality by treating same-sex and opposite-sex couples the same. The State Department formally announced that same-sex partners of those diplomats will be granted diplomatic visas, so long as they “legally marry in a jurisdiction that recognizes same-sex marriages.”

Neither does this policy put gay diplomats at risk in their home countries. In the event gay diplomats fear discrimination for marrying their same-sex partner, the State Department has promised that it is “committed to working with affected individuals to find an appropriate resolution.” As a practical matter, that scenario is hypothetical at best, because applications for domestic partner visas have always required the sending government or organization to provide a note in support of the application. Countries that would punish their diplomats for marrying a same-sex partner overseas would not provide such a note in the first place.

In summary, this policy change actually supports gay American diplomats, promotes gay rights abroad, and treats same-sex and opposite-sex couples equally. So, why are people calling it an anti-gay attack?

The American LGBT movement is experiencing an identity crisis. After the Supreme Court ruled in favor of marriage equality in 2015, many LGBT rights organizations lost their greatest political MacGuffin. It’s hard to keep a nonprofit political army funded and keep the organizational lights on when the biggest part of the crusade is won.

To replace it, some LGBT rights organizations have re-branded themselves into an “LGBT Left,” resorting to hard-left positions on issues unrelated to LGBT rights. They range from supporting sanctuary state laws to lobbying for government-run health care to championing abortion, to name a few, as though real LGBT people don’t fall on all sides of those debates.

Last month I attended the annual dinner of a major LGBT rights organization with a handful of Log Cabin Republicans. We maintain relationships with LGBT rights organizations and like to think of our presence as a reminder that equality is not a partisan issue.

At that dinner, one of the speakers urged more than 1,000 attendees to vote blue all the way down the ballot. She shouted that LGBT people’s failure to get out and vote for Democrats is to blame for Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in 2015. The room burst into applause, apparently without a clue that Davis had been elected as a Democrat in 2014.

LGBT people still face great challenges in the United States. Gay marriage is only legal in 25 of the world’s 195 countries. In about 70 countries, gay people can still be imprisoned, tortured, or killed just for being gay or being in a same-sex relationship. But those stories don’t make the news because the LGBT left does not prioritize them.

Instead of focusing on those pressing concerns, the LGBT left has chosen to trade its noble calling for a pottage of partisan cheap shots. By misrepresenting Republican policies that would promote LGBT rights as attacks on LGBT people, the LGBT left communicates that it cares more about manufacturing outrage for the sake of political power than working toward equality.

The LGBT rights movement can and should be a nonpartisan cause. We would make great progress if Republicans and Democrats worked together on LGBT issues. But by attacking Republican officials and policies that actually promote LGBT rights, the LGBT left cuts off its nose to spite its face.

Trump Has Not Banned Transgender Americans From Military Service,"LGBT activist organization Lambda Legal argued in front of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on October 10 in an ongoing effort to challenge President Trump’s “transgender military ban.”

The issue began in 2017 when President Trump tweeted a statement that the Human Rights Campaign says meant “thousands of transgender service members and countless more potential recruits found their worlds turned upside down.” The tweets indicated transgender individuals would be banned from serving in the armed forces, reversing an Obama administration policy. This spurred multiple lawsuits and ongoing controversy.

For example, Sarah McBride, a HRC spokesperson, said this “is part of a broader effort to push transgender people back into the shadows and out of public life. From the bipartisan chorus of members of Congress to leading medical associations to several federal courts, every passing day we see further proof that this president’s policy is animus-fueled, dangerous and unconstitutional.”

But as has been often the case in these highly politicized debates, the reality does not quite reflect the narrative. The transgender policy is detailed in a 44-page memorandum to the president, written by Defense Secretary James Mattis on February 22, 2018. The document titled “Military Service by Transgender Individuals” is an exhaustive review of the concerns related to both aspiring service members who are transgender and transgender people already serving.

The Military Is Not a Social Justice Organization

The details are remarkable and staggering in complexity. The paper uses compassionate language and illustrates an underlying respect for transgender individuals and an appreciation of their unique struggles without compromising accuracy and honesty.

Mattis states firmly that “The purpose of the Armed Forces is to fight and win the nation’s wars.” So the determining factor in a person’s qualification for military service is whether that person can meet the standards of the armed services, which the paper distills as “qualified, effective and able-bodied.”

Mattis states clearly that any eligible individual who can meet the high standards for military service without the need for special accommodations should be allowed to serve. This, he states, is “no less true for transgender persons than for any other eligible individual.”

He notes that 71 percent of the nation’s 17- to 24-year-olds are ineligible to join the military due to medical, mental, or behavioral reasons. He confirms that transgender people suffering from gender dysphoria are “no less valued members of our Nation than all other categories of persons who are disqualified from military service.” Although many citizens wish to serve honorably in the military, Mattis concludes, the best interests of the armed forces must sometimes decline their wishes.

Why Transgenderism Has Disqualified People from Service

Historically, military standards did not allow transgender individuals who wished to serve as the opposite sex to do so. The military previously held that individuals with a history of psychosexual conditions such as voyeurism, exhibitionism, transsexualism, or transvestism were not permitted to join.

Mental health conditions, listed in the DoDI 6130.03 manual, have always been a barrier to joining the military, and with good reason. Service in the armed forces present a highly stressful and dangerous set of conditions that mental illness can directly interfere with. The standards also contain disqualifying conditions that include chest surgery, genital surgery or deformation, castration, a history of suicidal thoughts or tendencies, depression and anxiety disorders, and the use of certain medications including hormone therapies.

In recent years, service members were not automatically discharged if they demonstrated gender dysphoria after joining. The military generally holds current members to a less strict standard because of the expense taxpayers have put into training that individual and in respect to that individual’s service. Therefore, the condition had to be considered an impediment to the individual’s performance or mental health through formal counseling to process a separation. Typically, in related cases this meant those with concerns about depression, suicidal tendencies, or misconduct related to cross-dressing.

In 2015 this standard was revised under Obama Defense Secretary Ash Carter, and became known as the Carter Policy. This is what has been meant by saying the Obama administration “lifted the ban” on transgender service members. So it is partially accurate, because there were already transgender members serving, just those who became transgender during service and had not presented other reasons to be discharged.

What the Obama Administration Policy Did

On July 28, 2015 Carter sent out a memorandum stating service members would no longer be involuntarily separated due to gender identity or gender dysphoria. He created a working group tasked “to study the policy and readiness implications of welcoming transgender persons to serve openly.” The working group was directed to “start with the presumption that transgender persons can serve openly without adverse impact on military effectiveness and readiness.”

The review commissioned the RAND National Defense Research Institute to conduct a study to identify the health-care needs of transgender service members, associated costs, and health insurance options. The report estimated between 1,320 and 6,630 transgender service members were already serving and that transgender treatments would affect military health care costs only minimally.

The report also concluded that accepting new transgender people as soldiers would minimally affect unit cohesion. Essentially, the report recognized that the new policy would negatively affect all aspects studied, but said these effects would be minimal.

So Carter’s primary changes were allowing service members to transition into transgenderism openly. A service member diagnosed with gender dysphoria could fully transition, partially transition, or “socially transition,” meaning he could cross-dress but not engage in any medical intervention. Whichever path chosen, the individual would be officially recognized as the preferred sex in all areas and held to the same standards as their preferred sex. This included dress and grooming, fitness standards, and access to bathroom and shower facilities.

The policy did not automatically allow transgender applicants to join, however. A history of gender dysphoria was still disqualifying unless a medical professional confirmed the individual remained stable without distress or impairment for 18 months. If the applicant completed a gender transition or had been stable in his or her preferred gender for 18 months with cross-sex hormone therapy, he or she could join if otherwise eligible.

Finally, an individual who underwent surgery to transition would be disqualified unless a medical professional confirmed a period of 18 months had passed since the person’s last surgery and he or she did not suffer any physical limitations or complications and no further surgery was required.

The Trump Admin Decided to Review These Policies

On August 25, 2017, President Trump directed the secretaries of defense and homeland security to reinstate the original, long-standing policy that largely disqualified transgender individuals from joining the military. His memorandum stated this should be in place “until such time as a sufficient basis exists upon which to conclude that terminating the policy and practice” would not “hinder military effectiveness and lethality, disrupt unity cohesion, or tax military resources.”

Trump’s memorandum argued that further study was needed to address the negative consequences presented in the Carter Policy. He gave both secretaries authority to determine how to handle currently serving transgender individuals and did not dictate taking any action against them.

On September 14, 2017, Mattis organized a panel of experts to fully investigate the effects of transgender service members on military readiness, lethality, unit cohesion, and taxpayer expenditures. Here are several key factors determined in the extremely comprehensive examination.

Transgender individuals with gender dysphoria experience extremely high rates of mental health conditions and suicidal tendencies. While the general population faces a 4.9 percent suicidal attempt rate, transgender individuals face a 41 percent rate. Due to the well-documented stress and dangers presented in military life, war zones, and extreme environments, there is a genuine concern that suicidal behavior would be increased in those suffering from gender dysphoria.

Service members with gender dysphoria are eight times more likely to attempt suicide than their peers are.

Service members with gender dysphoria are nine times more likely to have mental health concerns requiring medical intervention than the general military population does.

In the first year of cross-sex hormone treatment, patients must receive bloodwork reviews every 90 days. If the individual pursues reassignment surgery, which only 2 percent of transmen (women presenting as men) and 10 percent of transwomen (men presenting as women) pursue, the individual would require up to a year or longer for a full recovery. Upwards of 20 percent of transwomen who receive bottom surgery experience serious complications. This all would create obstacles to service members actually serving in their military capacities.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) studied more than 500 official sources to determine the effectiveness of gender reassignment surgery on positive health outcomes and found only 33 studies viable for review. Only six of those studies provided valuable information and all were considered limited by small sample sizes, a lack of validation, or subjectivity. CMS was unable to determine if reassignment surgery was “reasonable and necessary” for treating gender dysphoria, as there was simply not enough “quality evidence” to make a determination.

One of the most promising and well-organized studies came from Sweden and indicated that individuals who underwent reassignment surgery had a 19-fold greater mortality due to suicide than did the control group. Heart-related deaths increased 2 to 2.5 times the control group rate. The risk of psychiatric hospitalization was 2.8 times greater as well. In 2010, Mayo Clinic found that 28 primary studies on the effectiveness of cross-sex hormone therapy were very low quality.

For Other Conditions, Hormones Are Disqualifying

There were other significant concerns about the potential dangers of exposing transgender people to the military’s extremely harsh environments with high stress. Applicants who must take any synthetic hormone for the treatment of hypothyroidism, for example, are disqualified because it cannot be guaranteed the service member will have access to necessary medical treatment in war zones or other harsh, isolated environments. In the same way, transgender individuals who transition pose a higher risk of being unavailable for duty. Transitioning service members have an average of 159-167 days of limited duty out of one year.

Transitioning service members have an average of 159-167 days of limited duty out of one year.

Under the Carter Policy, a male who identified as female was entitled to full treatment as a female in all areas if that was part of his treatment plan for gender dysphoria. This presented significant obstacles to fairness, discrimination, and equality.

That’s because a male in this situation would be held to female fitness standards, body composition standards, and have access to female bathrooms and showers. As a male, he would hold an unfair advantage over females and be held to a lower fitness standard than other males. This creates inequality within the ranks and directly impacts unit cohesion and safety.

In contrast, female service members identifying as male would be expected to meet the higher physical standards of their male peers. Furthermore, as an anatomical male or female, their presence directly harms other service members’ privacy. The report indicates 424 service members currently hold approved treatment plans for gender dysphoria and 36 do not indicate any hormone or surgical transition. Only 22 have requested reassignment surgery with the majority requesting only cross-sex hormones.

Transgender Soldiers Are Still Serving

In light of the extensive research from Mattis’s panel of experts, the Trump administration has put into place a series of new recommendations. This is what LGBT activists are decrying as discriminatory and fighting in federal court. The divide is between those wishing to join and those who are already service members.

As long as a person has demonstrated 36 months of stability and otherwise qualifies, he or she can join the military.

Transgender individuals who do not suffer from gender dysphoria and do not have a history of the diagnosis and are otherwise qualified for service are able to serve without limitation as long as they meet the standards of their biological sex. Essentially, Mattis carefully distinguishes between a person with a gender identity that differs from his or her biological sex and a person diagnosed with gender dysphoria, a serious medical condition recognized by the American Psychological Association featuring clinically significant distress and impairment.

Currently it is estimated that 8,980 service members identify as transgender but only 937 have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, 10 percent of that population.

Transgender individuals with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria are disqualified with certain exceptions. Gender dysphoria diagnosed in childhood, for example, can have a persistence rate of 2 to 30 percent for male children and 12 to 50 percent in female children and therefore may resolve over time. As long as a person has demonstrated 36 months of stability and a lack of gender dysphoria, and otherwise qualifies, he or she can join the military. This is the same standard currently applied to individuals with a history of depression.

The Standards Apply Equally to Trans People

Transgender individuals who insist upon transition or who have already transitioned are disqualified from joining. This decision was determined based on the cumulative research demonstrating a concern for readiness, access to treatment, and the significant lack of scientific certainty concerning effectiveness of various treatment plans to remedy gender dysphoria.

As a rule, any DSM-5 psychiatric disorder that requires medication, has side effects or continual symptoms, and impairs performance limits the deployment of a service member and if deployed could significantly harm the individual. Due to the wide range of treatment options for gender dysphoria there is no fair and safe way to integrate all transitioned transgender individuals into sex-segregated environments.

For service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria, the condition is treated in a similar way to other conditions that would disqualify an applicant.

For service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria, the condition is treated in a similar way to other conditions that would disqualify an applicant. For example, high blood pressure would exclude an applicant, but a service member later diagnosed is only required to treat the condition. In the same way, as long as a service member is willing to follow the standards of his or her biological sex and does not transition, his service is not in question.

The policy is a carefully constructed compromise on a highly volatile situation and, while it limits the physical expression of gender identity for transgender individuals, it does not discriminate against them for being transgender. As Mattis states, “military service requires sacrifice. The men and women who service voluntarily accept limitations on their personal liberties.”

This includes freedom of speech, political activity, and even of movement. Individuals in the military are not allowed to express their personal sense of style or individuality or deviate from standardized grooming and uniform requirements. In this way, a transgender person is treated equally to all other applicants.

The policy is also careful to honor the service of members who are transgender while recognizing the reality of sex-segregated limitations on people with fluid gender identity. Far from a document advocating bigotry or hatred, it goes to great lengths to ensure equal treatment of all applicants and service members. While being transgender in no way disqualifies an individual, some gender expression is simply not compatible with military standards.

Many qualified transgender applicants are likely discouraged from following their dream and honorably serving their country due to the LGBT left’s fear-mongering and inaccurate reporting. Hopefully, with more honest evaluation, most will recognize the military simply expects them to hold to the same standards as everyone else rather than receive special treatment. This is lesson all of LGBT people should consider following.

LGBT Media Runs With 'Hate Crime' Stories Despite Red Flags,"The need for a powerful narrative, regardless of the truth behind it, is something we have seen grow more influential on the left. Narratives drive politics, but narrative has become a defining feature of how progressives view themselves and approach the concept of “truth.”

Within the LGBT world, this is even more pronounced. The desire to be viewed as a courageous victim has overtaken aspirations of equality and normalcy. LGBT media particularly appears to be dedicated to this singular narrative above all else.

On October 12, various media outlets reported that Morgan McMichaels, a drag queen on the TV show “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” allegedly broke his hand punching a Nazi after being threatened as a gay man. McMichaels shared an Instagram photo of himself and his cast, and wrote, “I was approached by a man at the store who informed me that he was a Nazi and he wanted to cut my f—-t throat after he took a swing I obliged him and finished the fight…. this f—-t will not be victimized.”

Why Didn’t Reporters Dig Deeper?

Over the next few days, every major LGBT website reported the story. But none of the reports went beyond the initial Instagram post and follow-up, in which McMichaels shows off a newly bedazzled cast while continuing to praise himself for overcoming adversity.

While a few noted that he has not commented further, and no police report has yet been filed, very little due diligence has been done. No witnesses were reported and no footage from onlookers or the store have been mentioned. Beyond the description of “Nazi,” the alleged instigator of the exchange was not described in detail, nor were any details presented of the verbal altercation itself, the extent of the fight, or how it ended.

The single source for this story comes from an individual’s sole claim, and LGBT media seems uninterested in looking into it any further. McMichaels is simply praised for fighting hate, no questions asked.

While more details could emerge to shed light on the incident, it would seem odd to the casual observer that a random gay man in Los Angeles would be confronted by a random Nazi who self-identified as such then proceeded to attack him, unprovoked, in public. On its face, the situation is suspicious, but to continue the narrative to include a public melee so dramatic it caused a broken hand without a single witness or detail is absurd.

Obviously, McMichaels must have visited a hospital to get a cast, but presumably the hospital staff would have asked how his injury was caused. If he had indicated that he had just been assaulted in a public hate crime, the police would have been involved.

The story simply does not make sense. Yet with a combined 200,000-plus likes on Instagram, it is quickly becoming solidified in the overarching narrative of anti-LGBT hate crimes. As Mic editor Evan Ross Katz, pointed out in a celebratory tweet, “Morgan McMichaels wearing an ‘I PUNCH NAZIS’ shirt during a gig, then punching an actual nazi who tried attacking her and THEN having her cast stoned is today’s mood.” If the story is indeed fabricated, it would make sense, and McMichaels might have a motive.

Anecdotal Stories Must Be Verified

In a similar story from October 15, Out.com reported, “Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon has become a powerful role model for young LGBTQ people. But even he faces homophobia.” Rippon stated, “I was walking in New York City and was holding my boyfriend’s hand,” he said.

“Some guy came up to us and said, ‘I hate f*****s’, then ran away. I just said, ‘That’s so sad that somebody would still want to do that.’” He went on to lament that during the Olympics he feared looking at any tweet with an American flag emoji as “…It was always something nasty, and it was always something homophobic.”

Again, without the slightest bit of interest in evaluating the claims presented, LGBT media simply asserted the account was true and representative of what LGBT people routinely face. While New York City is a highly diverse place, it is also one of the most liberal and gay-friendly cities in the country. Surely two men holding hands in public is not an unusual sight there, yet a random homophobe chose to shout that at them? While this certainly could have happened, LGBT media seems uninterested in critically looking at the narrative itself or asking additional questions.

While anecdotal stories are useful and do not require the same level of evidence as an accusation, they must still be reasonably evaluated. Did Rippon receive unkind tweets? Of course he did, he was a highly controversial figure during a major news cycle.

But the assertion that average Americans celebrating their country made him “fearful” acts only to confirm prejudice. The weight of his voice as an LGBT icon means his words have more influence and therefore hold more responsibility. Claiming to be a victim of a hate crime on pure narrative alone creates fear and hatred in the LGBT world when it is possible the event never happened at all.

Linked within the McMichaels story was a similar alleged hate crime that occurred in April 2018 when two drag queens were touring in England. The report claimed a random drunk girl began using anti-gay slurs towards the two men, who began to respond with equal viciousness, as recorded on a nearby phone. While no anti-LGBT slurs are heard, one of the drag queens shouted at the girl, “We’re touring the world being gay while you’re living in Newcastle with your crusty a– eyelashes.”

The article, which claimed the female perpetrator was engaging in “hate,” quoted her as screaming, “You’re a walking STD.” Despite what is clearly a mutual altercation between two equally vicious parties, the article laments, “Still, it’s 2018 and gay people can get slurs shouted at them in public. No matter how great anyone’s response is, it’s scary that it happened at all.”

Does Truth Matter Anymore?

All of this reminds me of a 2013 article in The Advocate, an LGBT magazine, titled “Have We Got Matthew Shepard All Wrong?” by Aaron Hicklin, who was reviewing a controversial book by gay author Stephen Jimenez, titled “The Book of Matt.” The book was a breakthrough in Shepard narrative, revealing through extensive interviews and research that Shepard was likely the victim of a drug-related crime with men he had previously engaged in sex with, rather than the brutal anti-gay hate crime immortalized in his name.

Hicklin says, “All that soul-searching may have felt necessary, especially in light of the legislation the case inspired, but was it helpful in getting at the truth? Or did our need to make a symbol of Shepard blind us to a messy, complex story that is darker and more troubling than the established narrative?” He goes on, “There are valuable reasons for telling certain stories in a certain way at pivotal times, but that doesn’t mean we have to hold on to them once they’ve outlived their usefulness.”

He finishes by providing insight from Dale Carpenter, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School, which should be a startling and disturbing realization for those of us passionate about equality under the law: “the notorious case of Lawrence v. Texas, in which the arrest of two men for having sex in their own bedroom became a vehicle for affirming the right of gay couples to have consensual sex in private. Except that the two men were not having sex, and were not even a couple. Yet this non-story, carefully edited and taken all the way to the Supreme Court, changed America.”

We cannot trust the media to portray events as they occur but rather as they are useful in a larger social story. While this reflects much of the concern the right has regarding the media as a whole, within the LGBT world it also profoundly affects individuals and their sense of safety and equality. Each story, hastily reported with minimal (if any) fact-checking fuels panic, fear, paranoia, and most importantly, hatred towards people who are otherwise accepting and tolerant.

When every LGBT source repeats the same story without critical evaluation, it creates the perception that these situations happen regularly. Each strengthens the next through repetition, until they all resemble what feels like the truth, if not only evidenced by their sheer number and frequency. Without a critical media, these stories become fictional tales, useful for political gain.

With enough passion and outrage, these fictional stories become the truth of a generation, even if they were never true at all. What is striking is the degree to which LGBT media does not seem to care.

Activist Courts Are Seizing President's Powers Just Because He's Trump,"Imagine if President Trump ordered troops to defend the southern border, but a federal judge suspended his orders so immigration activists could question his motives. Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ recent presentation before the Heritage Foundation suggests this scenario is not far-fetched — he said federal judges are breaking through constitutional guardrails with increasing frequency to encroach on powers of the executive branch.

What Sessions called “judicial encroachment” goes beyond activist judges applying their bias, instead of the law, when deciding cases. We are seeing federal judges repeatedly issue nationwide injunctions halting government operations that the judges deem politically incorrect.

Sessions noted that, in the first 175 years of our republic, not a single federal judge issued a national injunction. Since 2017, however, 27 district courts have issued injunctions shutting down presidential directives. In response to lawsuits from critics of Trump, judges repeatedly have suspended executive policies enacted under Article II of the Constitution.

Sessions mentioned several examples, including lawsuits LGBT activists have filed to stop Trump from revising Obama-era policies regarding transgender people in the military. Gender dysphoria, a psychological condition that involves confusion about one’s sex, previously disqualified a person from military service.

Lawyers for groups like the Human Rights Campaign and LAMDA Legal have demanded intrusive depositions and document searches to confirm Trump’s ulterior motives for changing his predecessor’s policies. Trump’s directives should be declared unconstitutional, they say, because he was motivated by “animus” against transgender personnel, not concerns about national defense.

Buying into the plaintiffs’ conspiracy theory, federal judges in Washington D.C., Baltimore, Seattle, and California issued nationwide injunctions ordering that Obama-era transgender policies be reinstated. The four “Supreme Judicial Commanders of the Military” assumed control, even though the Constitution does not authorize federal judges to run the armed forces.

These encroachments on powers of the commander-in-chief were based not on facts, but on mind-reading speculations about presidential motives, described as “hostility” and “animus” against transgender people. Therefore, plaintiffs argue, federal judges should declare Trump’s transgender policy revisions unconstitutional.

During the discovery process, lawyers for LGBT plaintiffs demanded privileged White House communications and pre-decision Defense Department documents. The same lawyers are trying to drag my organization, the Center for Military Readiness (CMR), into two of their four lawsuits against Trump.

Activist lawyers slapped subpoenas on CMR and several other organizations and individuals as “non-parties” in their lawsuits. An especially intrusive subpoena, arising out of the Seattle Karnoski v. Trump case, demands a search of CMR emails and communications with high-level administration and Republican Party officials going back to June 16, 2015 — the day Trump announced his presidential campaign.

If a federal court orders compliance, CMR will have to spend thousands of dollars on a professional IT search of our emails, followed by untold hours redacting personal information. Never mind that the Seattle judge already decided the administration possesses relevant information that the lawsuit plaintiffs seek, and that “There is no suggestion that this evidence can be obtained from other sources.”

More importantly, court-ordered compliance with the intrusive subpoenas would chill CMR’s First Amendment rights to independently report on and analyze military and social policies, and to receive first-hand information from sources who count on confidentiality.

Trump has every right to review and change his predecessor’s policies, especially when his decisions strengthen our military. Of the three co-equal branches of government, the judiciary is least qualified to make military policy. District judges nevertheless have applied unprecedented legal standards of review in the military transgender cases, ordering “heightened” or “strict” scrutiny going beyond the “rational basis” standard that courts historically have applied in similar military personnel cases.

In what may be the most ambitious gaslighting campaign in history, the Obama Defense Department enforced the belief that bureaucratic changes in a person’s “gender marker” certify a person’s switch from male to female or vice versa. Gender-determining DNA chromosomes remain unchanged, but some officials adopted without question the vocabulary and unscientific assumptions of LGBT ideologues.

District judges ordered the Trump administration to reinstate controversial Obama-era mandates, acting before completion of the extensive study that Defense Secretary James Mattis conducted. The Pentagon’s expert panel report released in March cited recent Military Health System data showing high medical costs, non-deployability, and elevated risks of suicide for gender dysphoric troops even after hormone and surgical treatments for gender dysphoria.

Judicial encroachment has become a pattern. When Trump first decided to ban travel from countries that have poor immigration vetting procedures, several federal judges issued nationwide injunctions suspending Trump’s directives. (The Supreme Court upheld a later version of Trump’s travel ban in 2018.) Another federal judge halted Trump’s attempt to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program — a controversial immigration policy that Obama imposed by executive order.

In a current case, a coalition of interest groups and attorneys general sued to challenge the administration’s plans to reinstate a question regarding citizenship in the 2020 national census. An overreaching judge allowed plaintiffs to depose Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to explore his motives for restoring the citizenship question, but the Supreme Court suspended the Ross deposition, pending a full-court review.

Sessions spotlighted a major problem, and Congress is considering legislation to fix it. In the meantime, the Supreme Court should seize opportunities to restore the constitutional order.

School Punishes Male Teacher For Refusing To Watch A Naked Girl,"A Florida school district allowed a self-described transgender female student regular access to the boys’ locker room, with no advance warning to the boys or their parents. The first time she walked in, she caught “boys (literally) with their pants down, causing them embarrassment and concern by the fact that they had been observed changing by an obvious girl,” says a complaint letter to Pasco County School District from Liberty Counsel, a pro-bono constitutional law firm.

With a “gag order,” school administrators forbade teachers from talking about the change, and ordered a male P.E. teacher to supervise the potentially undressed girl in the Chasco Middle School locker room, the letter says. When he refused to “knowingly place himself in a position to observe a minor female in the nude or otherwise in a state of undress,” administrators told him “he will be transferred to another school as discipline for ‘not doing your job in the locker room.'”

In an email, an administrator initially threatened to put the male coach on administrative leave, telling him that refusing to supervise a potentially naked female student would “not be tolerated,”said Liberty Counsel attorney Richard Mast. The school’s other P.E. teacher, who is female, also objected and was ignored.

Pasco parents have yet to be informed by the school of this situation, yet the transgender student continues to have open access to private male areas, according to Liberty Counsel. Despite the initial September incident, then legal contact in October, the elected board for the district with 70,500 students has so far taken no action and administrators have refused to budge.

“Unfortunately these things are going on across the country, primarily with school psychologists and guidance counselors,” said Mast. He noted that it’s standard for public schools to pass transgender policies without informing parents, voters, or taxpayers first. That means the public only hears about it after children have been affected, withholding all opportunities for parents to prevent their child’s exposure to this kind of sexual indoctrination, confusion, and exploitation.

Last year in a Georgia public school, a five-year-old girl was allegedly sexually assaulted by a “gender-fluid” male classmate in the school bathroom after a transgender policy allowed him access. He allegedly pushed her against the wall and repeatedly jammed his fingers into her genitals while she struggled. The district refuses to believe the alleged victim and the mother has pulled her daughter from the school, which never notified her of the incident and maintains its bathroom policy.

Sex Uber Alles, and Definitely Don’t Tell the Parents

It appears Pasco schools adopted their transgender policies with no notice to their elected school board, parents, or voters. Instead, they were implemented after the district hired Jackie Jackson-Dean, a school psychologist, as a LGBT liason. Her website lists her as the “primary author of the school district’s [LGBT] best practices guide,” which names her as its”lead content developer.” That guide says transgender pronouns, locker room, bathroom, dress code, and sports access are a student’s “right.” About overnight school trips, it says:

Schools should work with the student and their family to devise a plan for the trip, based on the student’s comfort level. Remember, schools have an obligation to not disclose the student’s transgender status to other students or parents unless the student has provided explicit permission to do so (emphasis added).

So a child could be placed overnight in a room with an emotionally or mentally struggling child of the opposite sex without that child or her parents knowing. The guide gives school staff a script of “Talking Points about Gender-Inclusive Schools.” Here are some selections for responses to concerned parents and students:

By the way, this second to last point is at the very least debatable, if not flat-out untrue. Newer research indicates the spread of transgenderism among children follows the patterns of other social contagions, such as suicide. A wider body of research indicates nonheterosexuality is highly fluid and tends to dissipate over time. Psychological research shows that early or repeated exposure to sexual images and ideas damages children.

An OutCoast.com article from 2017 says Jackson-Dean uses her position at the school to connect students with an organization called Metro, which has nine Tampa Bay locations. Metro helps LGBT minors and adults meet, gives counseling to LGBT-identified and questioning people including minors, and hands out drugs that aim to reduce HIV transmission when people have risky sex. Metro website notes that the Food and Drug Administration has approved this drug for children 15 to 17, meaning legal minors.

Pasco schools have refused to require parent permission for Jackson-Dean to refer minor students to an organization that appears to enable risky sex among minors by offering prescription drugs rather than responsibly advising people with immature decision-making abilities against dangerous, life-altering sexual encounters.

Activists Wield Courts to Force Schools Into Insanity

The guide also accepts the left’s legal arguments that laws that use the word “sex” should be understood instead to mean “gender,” and says the school district will ignore the Trump administration’s reversal of Obama-era U.S. Department of Education rules that required schools to do this in the absence of any legal authorization whatsoever.

The federal “Title IX has never been interpreted this way in its entire 40-year history until the Obama administration,” Mast noted. “It’s been rejected several times in the Title VII context, until the Obama administration.”

Liberty Counsel’s letter provides many other relevant legal arguments, such as: “It is not ‘discrimination’ to respect safety and privacy rights based on biological sex; nor is it ‘discrimination’ to respect parental rights to protect their minor children; and maintain safeguards against involuntary observation or molestation by members of the opposite sex, where children have a right to sex-based privacy protections.”

Despite the lack of genuine legal support for switching the meaning of the word “sex” to the word “gender,” activist courts have largely sided with groundless LGBT claims. Mast says this is because “when the ACLU files [cases like] this they’re betting on the school district tapping out. None of these cases have been reached on the merits.”

Thus school districts around the country are caught between expensive, highly emotional lawsuits with unpredictable outcomes, and protecting children. Usually they choose to expose the children and protect their money and comfort, with as little notice to parents and taxpayers as possible. The LGBT children get told their feelings trump all and require reorienting the entire social life of the school (as well as the curriculum!), while the other 97 percent get told their feelings are evidence of evil bigotry.

Supporting LGBT Kids Means Boxing Parents Out?

An “LGBT-Inclusive School,” Jackson-Dean’s guide says, has: “Health and sexuality education that is inclusive of all sexual orientations and gender identities”; “curriculum that regularly includes information about LGBT people, history, and events”; and “Library resources and displays that are inclusive of LGBT people, history, and issues.” It also has “Proms, homecoming, and athletic events that allow for gender-neutral alternatives to ‘King’ and ‘Queen'”; and “Observations of Mother’s Day and Father’s Day that affirm all family structures.”

A school that is helping LGBT students will not only treat families as potential sources of trauma whose rejection directly leads to LGBT children’s depression and suicide, but also have “‘Out’ teachers,” “Inclusive paperwork (e.g. NOT mother/father),” and “Messaging from administration regarding non-tolerance of harassment and discrimination,” the guide says.

That guide thanks the LGBT activist organizations Gender Spectrum, GLAAD, GLSEN, and Teaching Tolerance; the U.S. Department of Education; and special interest groups National Education Association (teachers union), National School Boards Association, National Association of School Psychologists, and American Psychological Association for their input and resources.

The district’s “gender support plan” includes measures to keep the child’s medical and psychological information secret from his or her parents. It in fact forbids school staff from telling parents about their child’s sexual experimentation without the child’s permission.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/11/14/florida-school-district-gags-p-e-teachers-telling-parents-girl-watching-naked-sons/,2018-11-14
What Happened To The Canadian Run Off Campus For Defending Speech,"More than a year ago, a Canadian academic publicly sought to promote open inquiry and freedom of expression in response to concerns Canadian universities were restricting these rights. Some students at this person’s institution protested, charging all manner of evils, and drawing all manner of far-fetched comparisons. The institution sought to administer disciplinary measures for the breach of political correctness.

You might think I’m referring to University of Toronto professor Jordan Peterson, the renowned proponent of free speech and author of the best-selling “12 Rules for Life,” but I’m not. There’s another Canadian doing similar, important work reverberating through the country’s academic institutions, and she’s increasingly going viral.

That person is former Wilfrid Laurier graduate student Lindsay Shepherd, who recently offered me an interview.

A Hauntingly Familiar Story

Shepherd’s battle with the liberal academic panopticon began shortly after she joined the master’s program in Cultural Analysis and Social Theory at Wilfrid Laurier University (WLU) in September 2017. On November 1, 2017, during a first-year undergraduate class Shepherd was teaching, she showed two clips from a public Canadian television channel. The first featured Peterson, who has been an outspoken opponent of Canadian laws that mandate the use of transgender pronouns.

A heated discussion among the students followed the videos. Later, a student approached an LGBTQ support group, which then filed a complaint with the university’s Diversity and Equity Office. That office requested a meeting with Shepherd on November 8.

Shepherd secretly recorded the meeting , which turned into an interrogation. During the 40-minute circus, university staff (who acknowledged her “positionality” regarding open inquiry), accused of her having created a “toxic climate for some of the students” by playing the clips and approaching the topic neutrally.

One professor even compared the pronoun debate to discussing whether a student of color should have rights. He also called Peterson a member of the “alt-right” and compared playing a clip featuring Peterson to “neutrally playing a speech by Hitler or Milo Yiannopoulos.” Peterson’s perspective was also rejected as “not valid,” as, apparently, not all perspectives are up for debate.

Shepherd released the recording to Canadian media. Not long afterward, WLU’s president, Deborah MacLatchy, apologized, as did Nathan Rambukkana , a professor and Shepherd’s academic advisor, who was the main antagonist in the meeting. MacLatchy said the meeting did not “reflect the values and practices to which Laurier aspires.”

Shepherd filed a lawsuit in June 2018 against the university, Rambukkana, and several others, for damages of $3.6 million, claiming “harassment, intentional infliction of nervous shock, negligence, and constructive dismissal.” Peterson also filed a lawsuit against Laurier and several university staff.

A Spokeswoman for Open Inquiry

Since the WLU disaster, Shepherd has become an active proponent for open inquiry and academic freedom. She has given numerous interviews to newspapers and television programs, as well as to YouTube channels such as “The Dave Rubin Report” and “Louder with Crowder.” She has spoken at numerous free speech events, while establishing a popular YouTube channel which now has almost 60,000 subscribers.

Her March 2018 video, “Goodbye to the Left,” in which she rejects her former self-labeling as a leftist, has been viewed almost one million times. In it, Shepherd refers to the left as “pro-censorship…victimhood culture… and moral righteousness.” Other videos have views in the hundreds of thousands. Her Twitter account is also popular, although the vast majority of her social media followers appear to be men, which she believes is because “so many women are SJWs.”

Shepherd has graduated from WLU. She writes a biweekly column for Canada-based The Post Millennial and still organizes events for the Laurier Society for Open Inquiry, the university organization she founded. WLU, by the way, has yet to file a state of defense regarding her lawsuit. Shepherd also works part-time as a court reporter, and is pregnant with her first child.

An Unlikely Conservative Ally

Shepherd was raised by her mother and grew up in an extended family where, she notes, there was an emphasis on ideas. Indeed, her mother, whom Shepherd describes as “intellectually curious and a promoter of open discussions,” has been a consistent source of support since WLU first picked this fight. It was her mother who advised Shepherd to record the conversation at WLU.

Yet Shepherd was not raised with a commitment to any particular ideology, nor any religious tradition. Perhaps even more surprising, she asserts that there is no real change in her opinion on political policy decisions — as the original secret WLU recording shows, she supports LGBTQ causes. She would still vote the same way she always has.

“I’m pro-environment, pro-gay marriage… I still believe that,” she states. But she is not interested in identity politics, and refers to “dirty strategies” employed by leftists like those who originally attacked her.

After the initial controversy, Shepherd “noticed right away” that conservatives were the most attracted to her story. She is been disappointed that people from all sides have not shown interest, although she is thankful for conservatives’ assistance. She has received some support from mainstream liberal media, but, she claims, “many Canadian academics hate me” because of their social justice disposition.

She notes, “they even accuse me of being a plant” to undermine academia — a reflection, Shepherd believes, that what now qualifies academics in universities is zealous, unquestioning dedication to “social justice, and Marxist and LGBTQ studies.”

Why Conservatives Support Shepherd

Although an unlikely alliance, conservatives must recognize the importance of joining hands with free speech heroes like Shepherd. She demonstrates an acute analytic mind, noting that free speech is always connected to deeper issues, namely the truth. Truth, she says, is related to “topics like transgenderism, and critiquing the Islamic faith or feminism.” If anyone critiques any part of the feminist agenda, she muses, that person is labeled a “woman hater” rather than engaged in a search for truth.

Reflective of her free-thought upbringing, she’s recently been influenced by Douglas Murray’s “The Strange Death of Europe,” which expresses concern with high third-world immigration levels. She is currently reading “Heretic” by Ayaan Hirsi Ali , a Somali who sought asylum in Netherlands and has abandoned Islam. Shepherd’s commentary increasingly spans a diversity of topics that should appeal to conservatives similarly concerned with leftist absurdities, while helping us better understand free speech battles in our northern neighbor.

Her video on indigenous land acknowledgements in Canada , for example, a topic that will be foreign to most Americans, demonstrates how the left offers sanctimonious homages to Native Americans more to virtue-signal than to actually address historical injustices against native populations.

“I saw a position for a professor advertised that required people to have a positive relationship with elders in indigenous communities,” she observes. She also refers to a public square in Vancouver has been renamed šxʷƛ̓ənəq Xwtl’e7énḵ Square in tribute to the local Squamish language. “Probably no one who lives there, or visitors, can read or pronounce that,” says Shepherd.

It’s possible Shepherd’s explosive popularity on social media will present professional opportunities, although she is hopeful of one day pursuing a PhD and working in the academy. Yet, she acknowledges, this seems a progressively unlikely option (no pun intended) given her image among leftist academics, who would probably try to prevent her from being hired on the grounds that she “violates any university’s diversity commitment.”

For now, she’s willing to “see where the culture goes first.” And, of course, deliver a healthy, happy, first child — she’s due in 2019. Here’s to hoping she raises an intellectually curious, stubbornly courageous child, as her mother did before her.

Delivery Guy In Berlin Fired After Telling Customer He Supports Brexit,"As the sharing economy is taking over, delivery drivers have an indirect relationship with the companies that employ them, making it possible for them to be fired on the spot. While that is a normal employment situation in the United States, Europeans are more inclined and likely to have a fixed work contract that in many countries makes it difficult for employers to fire them immediately.

Andres Georgi, 41, experienced this firsthand when he was fired from the food delivery service Deliveroo, a British company operating in numerous European countries. During a food delivery to a gay couple in Berlin, Georgi told me he noticed both an LGBT flag and a European Union flag next to each other in the customers’ hallway.

“I like the LGBT flag, but I don’t like the EU flag,” he told the man who opened the door, and said he thinks, “Brexit is a good thing.” He added that he thought Germany was too influential in the EU, and that other countries suffered from that. The man didn’t look too pleased, but no discussion ensued, and Georgi quickly forgot about the incident.

“I just told him that it’s probably not the right time to discuss something like this,” Georgi told me. “That was the end of the story.” So he thought. But it wouldn’t be, by a long shot.

The man who had opened the door was the partner of Redfern Jon Barrett, a writer and activist, whose website describes himself as a “polyamorous, pagan giant.” Barrett was not happy with the exchange, and tweeted his displeasure at Deliveroo. The tweet has since been deleted and the account protected, but it was captured in a screenshot by the German blog Ruhrbarone.

“The @Deliveroo delivery guy just went on an aggressive nationalist rant when he saw the EU flag in our hallway,” Barrett wrote. “We are gay immigrants who live in Berlin. Deliveroo: please don’t send Nazis to our door!” Notice that here he automatically assumes that agreeing with Brexit or casting shade on the European Union equals being part of a mass-murdering political party.

Deliveroo apologized in response to his tweet, and asked for more information so they could investigate.

@RedfernJon We would like to apologise for the unpleasant situation you had to endure. Would you be so kind as to contact us directly via email so that we can investigate this further? support@deliveroo.de — Deliveroo Germany (@Deliveroo_DE) October 29, 2018

Deliveroo subsequently fired Georgi from their driver system, citing unprofessionalism. In the past, Deliveroo had accused Georgi of harassing a customer, but it turned out that he was wrongly accused and the case was dropped internally. Georgi showed me the emails that Deliveroo sent him, which disclose that their HR department is also not convinced that Barrett’s story is correct, but are seemingly afraid of the potential backlash. The only thing Deliveroo says that can be supported is that talking politics with customers isn’t advisable for delivery drivers.

I reached out to Barrett to get his response to the incident. The story has been reported in Germany and the United Kingdom, but Barrett has not publicly commented.

Three months before the incident, Barrett submitted a short story called “Delivery” to a literary magazine, which he himself described as “a sticky, slippery story about fast food and revenge.” This short story is about a fast food delivery boy who discovers his partner is cheating on him on a delivery and gets revenge. Four days after the real incident with Georgi, the short story was published by the magazine. Self-fulfilling prophecies seem to remain real.

Georgi told me he is not a Nazi, and was actually a part of Germany’s Antifa movement in his youth. The two, while both authoritarian in nature, are fierce political competitors. Today he identifies as neither left nor right. He’s difficult to categorize, since he says he’s not entirely on board with capitalism (even though it is much preferably to anything totalitarian), and is staunchly pro-Israel and against radical Islam. Overall, Georgi seems like guy who loves conversation and political and philosophical debate, which in a city as open-minded as Berlin is not rare.

You can make up your own mind on Georgi’s stances, but he certainly shouldn’t have been fired for them. His stance that Germany is too influential in the EU has actually been echoed by the German left for years. This situation has devastated the delivery driver. Being called a Nazi in Germany is a much stronger accusation than it would be in the United States or the UK, and as a father of three children he faces an uphill financial battle. He still works as a delivery driver, but given the dominant position of Deliveroo, he can only get jobs at much smaller companies, which pay far less.

Georgi has set up a crowdfunding campaign for those who wish to support him in these difficult months prior to Christmas. There are real-life consequences to people who believe anyone who disagrees with them is a Nazi. And that reality isn’t pretty.

Criminal Records Show Women Shouldn't Want Men In Their Bathrooms,"In the showers of the U.S. Military Academy, Sgt. Michael McClendon surreptitiously video-recorded young, female future military officers during some of their most vulnerable and intimate moments. Today, as a result of policies implemented by the Obama administration, women who serve are getting victimized similarly.

To the peril of natal females, the Pentagon has granted males access to the very spaces that McClendon once prowled. During this well-intentioned but misguided thought process, American taxpayers have gotten victimized as well. That’s because, despite the hard work of medical professionals to help these men appear female to alleviate their gender dysphoria and the marching orders of the policymakers forcing everyone to accept them as women, the charade is a failure. They are and always will remain male.

Mirroring the policies of the Pentagon, in the girl’s bathrooms and locker rooms of Boyertown Area Senior High School in Pennsylvania, similar guidelines for the transgender population are jeopardizing the health and welfare of young girls. When female student Alexis Lightcap encountered a biological male in the girl’s bathroom at Boyertown, she abruptly left the restroom. The male calls himself female. What happened to Lightcap is not some made-up tale by religious groups to portray trans people as bathroom predators, because the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a nonprofit legal organization, has a video of her quickly exiting the restroom in fear.

While transgender people claim their gender identity, a relatively modern invention from the 1960s, is hard-wired, Lightcap’s primal reaction of feeling threatened by suddenly encountering an unknown male is traceable to the beginning of time. Her response was a protective survival mechanism embedded into her female biology.

The Unreasonable Side Is the Transgender Side

On Lightcap’s behalf, the ADF is suing the Boyertown, Pennsylvania school district where she attended classes. On some transgender military personnel’s behalf, a throng of LGBT legal organizations have filed several lawsuits against the Pentagon and the president because of their restrictions on transgender people serving in the U.S. military. Both types of cases are heading to the Supreme Court.

There’s a common theme at the heart of these legal actions. Lightcap says she doesn’t care if transgender people share a bathroom with her as long as they share her biological sex. The attorneys for the Pentagon argue the same. They don’t care if you’re transgender either, providing that you serve in the military as I did, in your biological sex.

According to the logic of the LGBT legal advocates behind these lawsuits, all filed in carefully chosen jurisdictions on both coasts, why should anyone care if a soldier goes on light duty or becomes non-deployable for 270 days or more? These advocates believe getting cosmetic vaginoplasties to appear as women or undergoing a double mastectomy to look like men justify these long absences from duty. They claim these are lifesaving surgical procedures to protect these troops from suicide. Medical groups such as the American College of Pediatricians (ACPeds) disagree, believing we need to find more humane methods for treating gender dysphoria.

The problem with this erroneous line of thought about suicidality is that Pentagon regulations have historically barred anyone with suicidal ideation or behavior from military service. Allowing transgender soldiers has left Trump’s military leaders in a quagmire as they struggle to control the 41 percent attempted suicide rate in the trans population while rolling back the unrealistic transgender military regulations implemented during the Obama regime.

It’s Not Medically Necessary to Amputate Healthy Organs

Drawing from equal protection cases, the do-gooder legal argument for transgender surgeries goes as such. If a sick person can get surgical procedures for diseases such as breast cancer, then these same type of radical surgeries have to be made available for transgender people to treat their gender dysphoria, an equally deadly malady in their eyes.

However, black and white thinking regarding equal protection is severely flawed in these circumstances, because, for example, phalloplasty for transgender men is significantly more dangerous than vaginoplasty is for transgender women. However, both types of surgeries would have to get approved by the military from an equal protection standpoint. The Pentagon is rightfully pushing back against this flawed reasoning.

As these legal and cultural battles rage, transgender people are flocking to LGBT-friendly places such as Oregon to get transgender surgeries performed through the state’s generous Medicaid program. This “follow-the-benefits” trend suggests they’ll join the military for the same entitlements. However, regardless of where the hormonal treatments or surgical procedures get rendered, and no matter which government agency pays for them, the poor surgical and physical outcomes for the recipients will be the same.

I Served My Military Career Without Transgender Care

I know this to be true on both fronts because, as one of eight children with blue-collar parents, I joined the Army at 19, serving 18 years before getting medically retired. As an enlisted transgender soldier, I spent my entire military career without any transgender health treatments, surviving without it.

The Trump administration believes this is sound and reasonable military policy. Based on my experience with the dangerous medical treatments for gender dysphoria since retiring, I do too. Military service shouldn’t get awarded to those who succumb to the mental ravages of gender dysphoria and the ideologies of transgenderism. It should instead be a right for only those who can persevere through the struggle.

I left the military riddled with anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress syndrome. While PTSD is the signature mental wound of trauma, anxiety and depression are the hallmark traits of gender dysphoria. This truth is something extensively documented in the February 2018 “Department Of Defense Report And Recommendations On Transgender Military Service By Transgender Persons.”

The data in the news articles I regularly collect on my transgender archives website paints the same picture as that Pentagon report. According to that Department of Defense (DOD) data, between October I, 2015 and October 3, 2017, the 994 active-duty service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria accounted for 30,000 mental health visits.

The Harm From These Off-Label Treatments Is Real

After I left the Army, the Department of Veteran’s Affairs (VA) began treating me for gender dysphoria. To protect themselves of liability from the well-known side effects of cross-sex hormone therapy and antiandrogen drugs such as sterilization, blood clots, vein problems, and damage to my vital organs, my VA physicians forced me to a sign what’s known as an “informed consent” document.

I did so willingly because the beginning of the long form alleged improved mental health and alleviation of my gender dysphoria through consuming or injecting off-label cancer and menopause medications. Five years later, however, there’s been no improvement in my mental health, and I still have a gender dysphoria diagnosis. I’m just as plagued with anxiety and depression as I was before the initiation of treatment.

However, the side-effects were real. Formerly healthy, I’ve twice landed in the VA emergency room with leg and vein problems, and I’ve had two psychiatric hospitalizations after a series of estrogen injections severely destabilized my mental health. Even after my hospital stays, I spent a couple of weeks in a psychiatric rehabilitation program that cost the taxpayers nearly $30,000. Do I sound cured or fit for military duty because of transgender health care?

Identity Is Not Biology

A year-long, gut-wrenching investigation by the Associated Press (AP) shows why it’s not fair to treat Lightcap or those who share her views as bigots or label them as transphobic because they refuse to share a bathroom or locker room with males who identify as females. From the fall of 2011 to the spring of 2015, investigative journalists from the AP uncovered close to 17,000 official reports of sexual assaults in schools.

The findings indicated these men retained a male pattern regarding criminality despite the surgery.

These were all documented cases of students assaulting other students. The investigation found these crimes were likely to occur wherever students were unsupervised, notably in bathrooms and locker rooms. In light of this, Lightcap prudently followed her instincts and bolted from the girl’s bathroom after suddenly encountering a biological male inside.

Besides concluding that male-to-female transsexuals are at increased risk for suicide despite undergoing cosmetic genital surgeries, the 2011 “Long-Term Follow-Up of Transsexual Persons Undergoing Sex Reassignment Surgery: Cohort Study in Sweden” reported another disturbing fact about men who surgically alter their bodies to appear as women. It found male-to-female transgender people had a significantly increased risk of offending compared to females, but not compared to other males. The findings indicated these men retained a male pattern regarding criminality despite the surgery. The conclusion was the same for violent crime, the study said.

Criminal Patterns that Match Their Biology

The years-long media article based research on my Transgender Archives website supports that study’s conclusion. To date, I’ve identified 67 transgender murderers. Fourteen of those killed multiple people, some are serial killers who murdered numerous women. Of the 67 I’ve found in news articles, the number born male identifying as female is 63. Three others were female at birth. One identifies as non-binary, with his or her birth sex not clear in the news reports

My findings on sex crimes involving transgender people are similar. Of the 75 incidents, I’ve gathered and cataloged 49 involved crimes against a person under 18 years of age. Males who identify as females were responsible for committing 66 of them and biological women were responsible for nine. However, many of the sex offenses involving biological women as the perpetrators involved tricking other women into believing they were men during sexual relations and were often consensual sexual activities.

Based on the evidence from the AP’s research and my own, women and girls such as Lightcap aren’t wrong to demand safe, private female spaces.

Like the statistics for violence, my sex crime data likewise supports the conclusion of the Swedish study, justifying the primal fears natal women such as Lightcap have about sharing intimate spaces with the broad transgender population of males with various transgender identities.

In other research conducted for a bathroom, locker room, and dressing room incident website, I’ve spent hundreds of hours and more than a year scouring search engines for these crimes. It’s arguably the most extensive collection of such data on the internet. Of the nearly 1,000 incidents I’ve collected to date, I was able to identify the biological sex of the person responsible in 952 of the instances.

In these documented incidents reported by the media, adult males were responsible 839 times; male juveniles were responsible 70 times; men dressed in women’s clothing were responsible 25 times; male-born transgender people who identify as women were responsible 7 times; adult females were responsible 25 times; female-born people who identify as males were responsible 1 time, and female juveniles were responsible 12 times. The crimes committed by women or girls rarely involve sexual activity or motivation, but they are hands down the biggest victims of such crimes.

Based on the evidence from the AP’s research and my own, women and girls such as Lightcap aren’t wrong to demand safe, private female spaces, offering protection from male aggression. Because of that, the ADF should get applauded for helping them to accomplish that goal.

Likewise, President Trump also isn’t wrong to demand mentally and physically healthy candidates for military service, personnel who can deploy at a moment’s notice and able to withstand mental or physical challenges. Lawyers for the Pentagon should get similarly applauded for working to achieve that goal.

"Hate Crimes Trending Down, But You Wouldn’t Know From LGBT Media","It must be a confusing time for many gay Americans. On the one hand, we read headlines from LGBT advocacy organizations like the Human Rights Campaign saying “New FBI Statistics Show Alarming Increase in Number of Reported Hate Crimes.” On the other we see headlines championing a new wave of LGBT political leaders taking office, such as the Washington Post’s “A banner year for LGBT candidates got even stronger with Kyrsten Sinema’s Senate win.”

President Trump nominated an openly gay and conservative lawyer, Patrick Bumatay, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, just as the HRC’s Chad Griffin declares, “A banner year for the LGBTQ community made clear that the days of attacking LGBTQ people for political gain are over, and the American people will not stand for lawmakers who try to drum up votes by trafficking in hate.”

While the majority, if not all, of legal and social issues facing gay Americans have been settled in our favor, LGBT media seem fixated on the narrowing list of negative experiences still affecting us. In particular, this includes raising alarm over a claimed rise in hate crimes.

In support of a new HRC initiative titled United Against Hate, Griffin tweeted, “New statistics reveal a disturbing increase in reported hate crimes & ongoing epidemic of anti-trans violence. Lawmakers must act with urgency to address this crisis and stand united against those who embolden hate through their words, actions, or silence.”

The report says there has been a 17 percent increase in hate crimes from 2016 to 2017. Citing the 20th anniversary of the murder of Matthew Shepard, the HRC stated, “These latest FBI hate crime statistics show that even decades after his brutal murder, LGBTQ people and other minorities are still facing alarming levels of hate-fueled violence.”

What we see, however, is actually a fairly steady reporting rate with a downward trend over the last decade. The FBI Hate Crimes report began separating “gender identity,” which includes transgender individuals, in 2013. After a drop that year, there has been a rise in incidents since then.

The HRC relies on a common assumption in discussing hate crimes and violence by insisting the reporting only shows a fraction of the real-world incidents. It states, “87 percent of the agencies that participated in the program reported no hate crimes in their jurisdiction, suggesting that agencies still face challenges in identifying and reporting hate crimes.” The organization also argues that while the number of reporting agencies increased in 2017, since hate crime reporting is voluntary, the numbers do not reflect reality.

The difficulty here is, of course, that since the numbers have adjusted only slightly over the years, a lack of reporting does not necessarily indicate unreported crimes. It is important to note that the definition of “hate crime” varies state to state and the categories of this crime can include persons, property, or society.

Of the total number of hate crimes affecting persons (57.6 percent) in 2017 in all categories, 44.9 percent involved “intimidation,” while 34.3 percent were “simple assault.” Simple assault is defined as “the attempt to cause serious physical harm to another individual. It also refers to causing the individual to be in fear or apprehension of an imminent battery. The crime does not involve physical contact with the victim.” Property crimes, which involved 39.7 percent of all hate crimes, were largely vandalism or destruction (73.7 percent).

Certainly, these types of crimes are destructive and traumatic for the victims, but proportion matters as well. It is clear that in the vast majority of these cases no person is physically injured.

Also, many incidents of vandalism turn out to be hoaxes. In November it was found that four out of five racist notes reported on Drake University’s campus in Iowa were committed by the student reporting them, and the fifth was considered a copycat.

Some claims of violence are also found to be hoaxes. In Portland, Oregon the family of a gay 22-year-old claimed he was the victim of a hate crime in which he was thrown from a moving train, resulting in severe injury and coma. An investigation, which included speaking with 300 people including passengers who had interacted with him, concluded, “There is nothing to suggest that he was involuntarily removed from the train. There is nothing to suggest criminal intent in this investigation.”

Hate crimes are also subjective. A case in Long Island in which a 21-year-old man stole LGBT flags from a church on multiple occasions is classified as a “hate crime.”

In July, it was found that in Washington DC nearly half of LGBT hate crimes prosecuted by the district end up being dismissed or dropped. Hate crime convictions are much smaller than reports, as well. In Texas in 2017, “[f]rom 2010 through 2015, there were 981 cases reported to police in Texas as potential hate crimes. ProPublica examined the records kept by the Texas Judicial Branch and confirmed just five hate crime convictions.”

The report goes on to say, “Interviews with law enforcement make clear that some number of the reports wind up dismissed because of too little evidence – or evidence that suggests that the alleged crimes didn’t happen at all. Another considerable number are cases that fail to produce an arrest and thus go unsolved.” Most reported hate crimes, per the interviews, never identify a suspect.

It is also important to remember that reports of transgender murders, often cited as a growing epidemic, often reflect murders of transgender individuals but without a biased motivation. It should also be noted that as LGBT breaks down into smaller and smaller categories with more broad definitions of “hate crime,” this will result in increases at smaller levels even if the overall numbers do not reflect a total trend. So will adding categories, as the FBI did in 2013 with gender identity.

The political left and right view this situation differently. From the left’s perspective, the lack of conviction, evidence, and reporting indicates a systematic problem, reflecting prejudice, ignorance, or both. The right views this all as proof the left is exaggerating the problem. The stream of highly publicized incidents that turn out to be hoaxes and the lack of common experience reflecting the claims of an epidemic of violent hate reinforces this view. Those who are targeted with violence or hatred based on their personal characteristics are significantly harmed by any false claims, since this increases the perception that claims of a hate crime are likely to be a hoax.

One major difficulty in understanding hate crime is that it is not common to witness bias crimes or even hatred targeting a specific protected group. While this does not diminish genuine hate crimes, it does affect their relevancy to public discourse.

The truth is that, outside of rare outliers, hate crimes in general, and LGBT hate crimes in particular, are trending downward over time. While the LGBT media focuses on year by year changes, depending on their current political narrative, it must be viewed as a larger picture of society. Our country is generally growing safer over time, with fluctuations year by year.

As a society we must address violence and hatred, but we do not need to perpetuate fear and paranoia in groups when it is not necessary, especially for politics. We LGBT people live in a remarkably safe and accepting society that takes violence and hatred towards us extremely seriously. It is our obligation to ensure that dedication to defeating this hatred is honored with truth and relevance.

We should be careful not to exaggerate and exploit fear and our fellow Americans’ good intentions. Hate crimes are rare, and LGBT hate crimes are trending downward over time. That is a great thing we should be celebrating as a culture. It will continue to get better if we can focus on fighting real hated and violence, rather than perpetuating political narratives.

NYC’s Nonbinary Birth Certificates Are A Self-Contradictory Mistake,"As of January 1, residents of New York City can change their birth certificates to legally indicate they believe they are not the male or female they were born. They can also legally declare they are neither male nor female, with a simple X.

For this change, one doesn’t need a note from a physician, psychiatrist, or any official, nor to have undergone any type of clothing, body, or hormonal change. To require any of these means the individual would have to submit to someone else’s expectation of what a male or female is, a serious gender theory no-no.

The entirely subjective declaration of the claimant is all a city clerk needs to amend this most fundamental of all legal documents. You simply say it’s so, and it is. The Associated Press, HuffPo, and other outlets reported that parents can indicate their newborn is neither male nor female, but this is not so. Michael Lanza, a spokesman for the NYC Department of Health, told the The Federalist the law only applies to adults. Youth of any age can claim male, female, or the “nonbinary” X with a parent or guardian’s attestation.

Mayor Bill de Blasio praised the new law, saying New Yorkers should tell their government who they are and “not the other way around.” It’s a cuddly sentiment, to be sure, but untrue. Suppose I told de Blasio and his department of health that I’m a teenage Laotian able-bodied paraplegic and member of his City Council. He would happily tell me what’s what and “not the other way around.” Even if I have a note from my parents.

But this is not the reason this law, and similar ones in other states, is madness. I don’t use that word rhetorically, combatively, morally or judgmentally. It’s wholly descriptive. So that there’s no misunderstanding, let me clarify what I mean in using the word madness: being in state of illusion, dementia, and instability, not only disconnected from, but being contrary to reality, all while pretending to be completely healthy.

Even though I’m a shameless religious conservative, let me step out on a limb and appeal to cold, calculated, orderly reason. Laws allowing citizens to change their birth certificates to either or no sex are completely contrary to reality, and here are some reasons why.

It Contradicts LGBT Self-Conception

First, it radically violates the LGBT conception of justice and equality. Guaranteed, it is just a matter of time until this fatal flaw reveals itself and is changed. But under their premises these new birth certificate laws (and their driver’s license cousins) are as bigoted as my childhood friend’s dad.

To him, there were only three races: Whites, blacks, and “Egyptians.” If you’re not one of the first two, the third was his convenient, and ignorant, catch-all category. New York City is doing the very same thing. Their X is Mr. Sofield’s “Egyptian.”

Imagine how this works. You arrive at the New York City Department of Health, totally stoked that you can now have your birth certificate declare “who you are really are.” You inform the clerk you are not the male or female you were haphazardly “assigned” at birth, but that you’re genderqueer, genderfluid, agender, bigender, pangender, polygender, androgyne, neutrois, or any of the other 50+ genders that supposedly exist.

The clerk responds, “Wonderful, honey. We’re just gonna put you down as X.” Yes, X! Never mind that New York City will legally and permanently refer to you by the sign teachers use to mark something wrong. Even those who play along with the game have to admit this is a major d’oh.

No One Is Nonbinary

Nonbinary is a belief that develops over time in one’s own self-perception. It is not an objective, medical fact. It cannot be confirmed or denied by any medical professional. It is not an intrinsic factor of one’s body, but a product of the mind (not the brain).

This is the bare fact of the matter. Every human body is either male or female. This, and this alone, is what a birth certificate records. (Intersex, an actual physiological and medical condition of ambiguous genitalia or reproductive organs, or confused chromosomes, is not a third gender or nonbinary.)

This Isn’t the Purpose of a Birth Certificate

A birth certificate, or death certificate for that matter, doesn’t record how one feels about or understands oneself. A birth certificate notes the facts of a birth, including what one is born as. It is an objective document recording a few essential facts about an event that happened on a particular day, time, and place: name of newborn, date and place of birth, parents’ names, handprints, footprints, and sex of the child.

These things do not change. The document does not amend itself according the child’s life-course, personal evolution, or self-understanding. That is not the document’s purpose. It cannot and should not be used for social engineering or personal affirmation.

It Fundamentally Contradicts Basic Gender Theory

Let’s count the ways.

Conflates sex with gender. You will be told emphatically in the first 10 minutes of your first gender studies class that gender and sex are two different things. As their ditty goes, sex is what’s between your legs and gender is what’s between your ears.

Birth certificate laws allow people to change their gender designation, but it’s the medical determination of the “what’s between the legs” not “what’s between the ears,” that’s recorded on a birth certificate. These birth certificate laws conflate sex and gender, something that would get you a big red X on your first gender studies test.

Denies gender is a spectrum. The second great commandment of gender studies 101 is that “gender is a spectrum.” But the three points New York City’s new law allows—male, female, and the nonbinary X—does not a spectrum make.

They are radically contrary to basic science. Gender theory is on an inevitable crash-course with the empiricism of biology. Place your bets on which will ultimately prevail.

The sex that gender theorists simplistically tell us is “between one’s legs” is found throughout our bodies, and intensely so. Our male and femaleness is imprinted in nearly every cell of our bodies. That’s a whole bunch of observable male or female coding, which is totally untouched by a simple change of clothing, hormones, surgery, or a new birth certificate.

Of course, male and femaleness determination is also found throughout every ounce of our blood as well as in the physicality of the brain. Just recently, university scientists found a way to determine the sex of ancient human skeletal remains by examining tooth enamel proteins. Our flippin’ teeth are marked male or female! And biology knows of no other sexes or genders. Sex is not what’s between your legs. It’s what your body is.

Our flippin’ teeth are marked male or female!

Looking at it another way, the religion and biology departments on the most respected university campuses have a closer connection, in methodologies and body of knowledge, than do gender studies and biology departments. Professor Allan Schore, a world-acclaimed neuro-biologist and neuro-endocrinologist at UCLA’s school of medicine, recently wrote unapologetically that “gender studies in developmental psychology remain[s] divorced from and [is] frequently antithetical to biology.” Let it be clear: these birth certificate laws side against what actually exists.

Thus, they are driven purely by fashionable dogma and the politics of personal destruction. Advocates would not only have us believe, but force us to accept, speak, and arrange our lives (under threat of personal abuse, shaming, and professional destruction) as if some recent scientific or medical discoveries have established that being trans or nonbinary is actually a thing.

There have been no such discoveries. It is mere ideology, dogma that exists only in the advocates’ beliefs about what reality should be. To go along with this is to be complicit in the illusion even though any refusal to do so gets you branded as the vilest kind of hater. And it doesn’t matter a wit how kind and winsome you are in disagreement. It’s a very knee-jerk and absolutist system they are running here.

This is why the push to be able to change one’s most fundamental legal document in this way is so politically important for the gender activists. If something that merely exists in the mind can be put into a legal document that follows you for life, it becomes “real.” It then gains the full power of law, becoming a more potent weapon to bludgeon all of us into affirming their delusion with our required use of names, pronouns, public actions, and workplace policies.

For responsible adults to play along with this illusion is, indeed, madness.

Dear Christians: Billboards Targeting 'Bruce Jenner' Are Counterproductive,"About two weeks ago, a northern California pastor, Justin Hoke, posted a message to his church’s marquee. The Trinity Bible Presbyterian Church marquee reads “Bruce Jenner is still a man. Homosexuality is still sin. The culture may change. The Bible does not.”

I’m appalled that the pastor used the public sign to call out Jenner by name. The statements, while technically correct, alienate people who need the healing message of Jesus Christ. Pastor Hoke’s actions damaged the church’s message of redemption and restoration through Jesus Christ. The Bible says in Romans 3:23: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” As a fellow sinner, Pastor Hoke should apologize.

A similar thing happened to me when I was living as Laura Jensen, a female transgender, and looking for a church to attend. One pastor in southern California told me, “We don’t want your kind in our church.” Thankfully, however, not all pastors are ignorant in how to reach messy people, even the transgender-identified.

I had a life-changing experience with another pastor and his church in northern California, where parishioners were willing to love me through that very difficult time in my life. The pastor exhibited a refreshing perspective when I asked him if he was going to try to change me from Laura to Walt. He said, “It’s our job to love you; it’s God’s job to change you,” and that’s exactly what happened.

The leadership of that church now says that having me in their midst and getting to know my struggles was an amazing, once-in-a-lifetime spiritual growth experience for them, too. In that loving community of people, I found redemption and restoration of my male identity.

Pastors Need Information, Too

The church, as a complement to medical treatment, can play a vital role as a “spiritual hospital” where hurting trans people find a healing environment. But few pastors are equipped to understand the variety pack of difficult issues the trans-identified population brings to the church.

Some, like Pastor Hoke, see trans behavior as a sin issue and clearly signal that those people aren’t welcome. Others are open but need to learn how to approach transgender-identified people appropriately. Today’s church leadership could benefit from some information and education about the trans population.

For starters, “transgender” is an umbrella term that covers a variety of identities and behavioral motivations. The following list shows some of these for males (a comparable list exists for females):

Crossdressers like to dress in women’s clothing in private, and are usually heterosexual.

Drag queens are flamboyant cross-dressing men, often homosexual, who feature prominently in publicity photos of gay pride parades.

Transvestites are crossdressers who get emotionally excited when wearing opposite-sex clothing in public. Some of these have a transvestic fetish disorder marked by excessive sexual arousal when crossdressing.

Some people who identify as transgender are driven by an arousal-fueled behavior called autogynephilia, where men dress as women, stand in front of the mirror, and become sexually aroused at their own reflection.

None of these conditions benefit from social or surgical transition, yet I’ve heard from people in all these categories who were encouraged to transition. Afterward, often many years later, they ask me how they can get their lives back. That’s also the time when some will look for a church to get reacquainted with God.

The underlying issues can be complex. Often, the people who contact me have underlying coexisting mental disorders that should be properly diagnosed and treated, but usually aren’t. Many are suffering from childhood events such as sexual abuse, trauma, or being cross-dressed and affirmed. Some were bullied and beaten by classmates because they were different. Their gender distress is real, and these people deserve proper medical treatment, including psychological counseling to resolve childhood issues.

A resource for church leaders to better understand the reasons people fall into a transgender life and how they come to realize it doesn’t work for them is my new book, “Trans Life Survivors.” It contains emails from 30 people like me who left the transgender life, a section on trans children, the latest research, and resources for detransitioning.

It’s Hard to Be Trans, and the Church Can Help

The research that portrays presenting in a cross-gender identity, i.e., social and medical transition, as a positive and effective treatment is shaky and unsound, according to a 2004 review of more than 100 international medical studies regarding post-operative transsexuals by the British University of Birmingham’s aggressive research intelligence facility (Arif).

Arif warned “the results of many gender reassignment studies are unsound because researchers lost track of more than half of the participants. For example, in a five-year study of 727 post-operative transsexuals published last year, 495 people dropped out for unknown reasons.”

The Arif report points out the sad fact that, after assuming a cross-gender identity and surgically rearranging the genitals, “a large number of people who have the surgery…remain traumatized––often to the point of committing suicide.”

For those who remain traumatized after surgery, the church can provide a life preserver of hope. The church should be the place that takes hurting people in, encourages them to know God personally, and celebrates their stories of redemption and restoration. Instead, Pastor Hoke’s marquee message pointlessly pokes an accusing finger at Jenner.

A truth-telling, Bible-based church loved me back to wholeness as the man God created me to be. The leaders made a deliberate effort to get to know me and support me through all the ups and downs of the journey.

I don’t know if Pastor Hoke was suggesting Jenner is a homosexual man or if he wants to imply all transgender-identified people are homosexual, but I encounter this misconception often when I speak, so I want to take the opportunity to clear it up. Most of the men who transitioned to female and later wrote me for advice to detransition were attracted to women, i.e., heterosexual.

Gender dysphoria is about core identity: “Am I a man or woman?” Homosexuality is about sexual attraction: “Am I sexually attracted to men or to women?” Knowing that someone identifies as transgender reveals nothing about that person’s sexual preference. In my experience, a man who thinks he’s a woman is more likely to have the same sexual attraction as Pastor Hoke.

How To Minister To ‘Scary People’

My autobiography, “A Transgender’s Faith,” contains a chapter targeted to church leadership authored by Jeff Farrar, the pastor of the church that helped me. In it, Pastor Farrar shares how to minister to “scary people” in a way that is biblically sound and protects the church. He refers to them as “scary” not because they are scary, but because “their situations and experiences are so outside of ours that they scare us. We simply do not know what to do with them.”

Here is some of the wisdom Pastor Farrar shared from working with me, who presented as Laura in his church. The first step is to evaluate the person’s attitude toward God and the church—broken or defiant?

If the person who presents in a cross-gender identity is seeking a place of refuge from their broken transgender life and open to the Lord, then welcome them with open arms. The broken person, says Pastor Farrar, “needs to be encouraged, lifted up, gently pointed to the truth and urged to trust the Lord.”

In contrast, the defiant person “needs to be exhorted, confronted, even opposed by the weight of Scripture in the hope of pulling them back to obedience.” If they refuse and defiantly shake their clutched fist at God, claiming they have the right to do whatever they want in the church, the pastor has every right to take any and all necessary steps to remove the defiant person from the church, protecting other parishioners.

Determine What Kind of Church We Want to Be

Pastor Farrar shares honestly how having me—a man living and presenting as a woman—as part of the church was challenging to him and the other church leaders. Leaders like to be confident of having the answers. But a transgender person in their midst was uncharted territory, and they made mistakes.

Each leader had to find a deeper level of faith—seeking the Lord, depending on him, and obeying his direction. As a church, they had to put into action principles, such as love and grace, that until this point had simply been lofty-sounding words. The rubber hit the road. It was messy at times, and some members left.

Pastor Hoke’s tone in his marquee message seems harsh and condemning. In Scripture, Jesus gives an example of how the church is to treat people living in sin. The Jewish leaders brought a woman caught in adultery to Jesus. The Law of Moses said to stone her, and they wanted to see what Jesus would say.

The Bible says that Jesus wrote on the ground with his finger for a while and then said to them, “Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.” After a time, all her accusers walked away, leaving Jesus and the woman. He asked her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?”

“No one, sir,” she said.

“Then neither do I condemn you,” Jesus declared. “Go now and leave your life of sin.” (John 8:3-11 NIV). Pastor Hoke’s tone seems to mimic that of the Jewish leaders who approached Jesus, smug and self-righteous about catching the woman in her sin. Thank goodness my pastor didn’t project that attitude with me.

In retrospect, Pastor Farrar said the leaders had to decide what kind of church they wanted to be. They could have opted to play it “safe,” but instead they courageously chose to embark on a spiritual adventure that all now say was the greatest experience in their church’s life. It was also life-saving for me, the broken person needing refuge.

I pray that more churches let go of “safe” and choose to compassionately welcome those poor souls who mistook transition for treatment and need a supportive church family to show them God’s love, truth, and grace.

Netherlands Investigates Pastors Who Publicly Affirmed Marriage,"Two hundred and fifty evangelical Dutch pastors are under fire after signing a statement affirming basic Christian beliefs about sexuality in December. The Nashville Statement affirms signatories’ adherence to the Bible’s mandates regarding marriage and sexuality. The Netherlands, which is overwhelmingly progressive and secular, is currently exploring whether the pastors who signed the statement violated discrimination laws.

The Nashville Statement, drafted in Tennessee in 2017, reaffirms historic Christian theology reserving marriage to one man and one woman for life. The statement was written by The Council of Biblical Manhood and Womanhood, which is headed by American theologian Denny Burk.

Original signatories of the statement include prominent North American Christian leaders like James Dobson, D.A. Carson, John Piper, and many others. In addition to its biblical definition of marriage, the statement also rejects the notion of gender identity that does not coincide with biological sex. To date, more than 22,000 people have signed the statement.

After its initial release in the United States, the Nashville Statement received a tremendous amount of backlash from left-wing groups, celebrities, and even non-traditional Christian churches. It did not, however, prompt legal ramifications for expressing religious beliefs—a protected right covered explicitly by the First Amendment.

In the Netherlands however, the signing of the statement prompted such significant backlash that the country’s Public Prosecution Service is currently investigating whether the statement violates Dutch discrimination laws. In the Netherlands, current public approval for same-sex marriage is at 90 percent, which is up from 54 percent just 12 years ago in 2006.

Article I of the Dutch constitution states: “Discrimination on the grounds of religion, belief, political opinion, race or sex or on any other grounds whatsoever shall not be permitted.” In both this case and other clashes between faithful religious believers and LGBT policies, it seems that government is being forced to pick which side will be discriminated against. So far in such conflicts, Western governments have been largely choosing to privilege LGBT people while discriminating against religious citizens.

The Dutch News referred to the Nashville Statement as an “Anti-Gay Charter.” LGBTQ advocacy groups (LHBTI in the Netherlands) claim the pastors’ choice to adhere to their religion is hateful and discriminatory. Opera singer Francis van Broekhuizen even filed a formal police complaint against one signer, claiming, “The whole pamphlet is a call to renew discrimination against LHBTI people. I feel really hurt and very sad.”

In fact, the Nashville Statement offers no discrimination. Nowhere in the text does it claim any intention to reject or mistreat any person for their personal beliefs and behaviors. It simply states the Christian commands the signers have always affirmed and confirms their resolve to continue preaching those values. In an interview on Dutch television, Burk explained that the Nashville Statement “is really designed for churches and represents the consistent belief of Christians for 2,000 years.”

Attempting and executing legal intervention to suppress religious expression is hardly new for Europeans, however, and Christianity is not alone in its ostracization. On January 1, the Belgian region of Flanders enacted a ban on a specific type of animal slaughter used by both Jews and Muslims. Neighboring region Wallonia will follow with a similar ban in September.

Belgium was preceded in this ban by six other European Nations. Practicing Jewish and Muslim people living in these countries must now import their meat from nations without a ban, an increasingly difficult task with an uncertain future.

Burqa bans have also become increasingly popular throughout Europe. In August, Denmark enacted a ban on full face veils in public places. They followed several other European countries, including the Netherlands, in both partial and full bans of traditional face coverings for Muslim women. Many Muslims have rallied against the bans with support from the United Nations.

Quite simply, religion is no longer in line with the largely left-wing populations and governments of much of Europe. As progressive politics continue to replace spirituality worldwide, it seems unlikely the criminalization of religion will end.

Left Opens War On All Religious Schools By Targeting Karen Pence,"Vice President Mike Pence’s private religious views have been a remarkably common aspect of liberal commentary. Pence is one of the most polite and respectful religious people ever, if the headlines about him are to be taken into context.

The most recent was a breathless HuffPost headline that read, “Karen Pence Is Working At A School That Bans LGBTQ Employees And Kids.” It begins with a dark and somber tone: “Karen Pence, wife of Vice President Mike Pence, started at a job this week teaching art at Immanuel Christian School in Northern Virginia. It’s not a school where everyone is welcome.”

The core cause of concern comes from the parent agreement, which says the school may refuse admission or deny continued admission if a student participates in or condones homosexuality. The writer is stunned that the employment application “also makes candidates sign a pledge not to engage in homosexual activity or violate the ‘unique roles of male and female.’”

The author further states, “The application says that the school believes ‘marriage unites one man and one woman’ and that ‘a wife is commanded to submit to her husband as the church submits to Christ.’” The application asks potential employees to explain their view of the “creation/evolution debate.” The “parent agreement” asks parents to cooperate in its “biblical morality” policy.

After confirming that the state of Virginia, as with many other states, permits private religious schools to discriminate, the article ends with a quote: “‘Why not teach at a school that welcomes everyone, instead of choosing one that won’t serve LGBTQ kids, kids of LGBTQ parents?’ said JoDee Winterhof, senior vice president for policy and political affairs at the Human Rights Campaign, in a statement to HuffPost. ‘The Pences never seem to miss an opportunity to show their public service only extends to some.’”

This Is All Definitely Informed Consent

To be sure, the school is very specific in its expectations of conduct from students, their families, and faculty, and goes to great lengths to detail the belief system under which the school operates. The Parent Agreement opens by stating, “We are, first of all, a Christian school and a ministry of Immanuel Bible Church (IBC) and as such establish the biblical basis from which we will teach a Christian world and life view.”

The parental consent portion states, “I acknowledge that the Immanuel Christian School partnership is designed for parents who are born-again, Bible-believing Christians who have accepted and continue to acknowledge Jesus Christ as personal Lord and Savior. Therefore, I agree to support the biblical teachings and guiding principles that Immanuel Christian School takes from scripture to educate my children.”

The statement of refusal or admission for a student is part of a larger stipulation that the household must be dedicated to a Christian lifestyle to participate in the community. It therefore forbids anyone in the home from “contumacious behavior, divisive conduct, and participating in, supporting, or condoning sexual immorality, homosexual activity or bi-sexual activity, promoting such practices, or being unable to support the moral principles of the school.”

The teacher application is a document of agreement to the stated founding beliefs known as the Statement of Faith and asks the teacher to agree, in part, “I will not teach contrary to the beliefs expressed therein in any setting sanctioned by or affiliated with Immanuel Christian School or Immanuel Bible Church.” This agreement follows a very detailed listing of specific Christian beliefs and the school’s religious views of each.

The teacher applicant must also sign, “I affirm that, as part of the qualifications for employment, I am a born again Christian who knows the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord.” Finally, after several additional agreements regarding behavioral and moral standards of conduct, the agreement states, in part, “I agree to notify the ICS leadership in writing should my beliefs, behavior or lifestyle choices change or come in conflict with the sincerely held religious beliefs of Immanuel Christian School as indicated by the Articles of Employment and Immanuel Bible Church’s Statement of Faith.”

It would be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, for a non-believing individual to become employed without recognizing the religious nature of the school.

This Is Common Among Religious Schools

From the Huffington Post writer’s use of quotations throughout, the emphasis is heavily fixated on the express religious motivation in the various documents. After a review of other private schools with similarly strict religious observances, I wonder if the writer is simply unaware of how common this is.

Mesivta Birkas Yitzchok, an Orthodox Jewish boy’s private school, for example, states on its mission page, “The goal of Mesivta Birkas Yitzchok is to produce G-d fearing and Torah observant students who excel academically in both Torah and General Studies. The environment of the school will be one that nurtures religious growth, refinement of character, and encourages a lifestyle wherein Torah, its study and culture, are primary.”

The Yeshivah of Flatbush Elementary School in New York City states, “We share with the students that Torah, mitzvot, and a relationship with Hashem are central elements to each of our lives.” The school requires boys to wear a yarmulke and tzitzit (religious garment) and girls are forbidden to wear pants after preschool age. The school forbids home-cooked meals be brought in, and all food must be strictly certified kosher.

An Orthodox high school, Yeshiva University High School of Los Angeles, that is divided into a boy’s school and a girl’s school states in its mission, “The religious philosophy of YULA is based on the acceptance of Torah from Sinai and a total commitment to the halachic process in determining one’s lifestyle. YULA identifies with those who combine a halachic lifestyle with active participation in contemporary society without any compromise or laxity in the observance of halacha.”

The Al-Madinah School, an Islamic private school in New York City, provides extensive religious requirements for both students and teachers. The student application states that all adults and parents must obey strict Islamic dress codes in the school and Islamic behavioral codes in and outside the school. Parents engaging in un-Islamic behavior on school grounds or outside of school may result in the expulsion of the student. Of course, traditional Islamic behavior precludes LGBT forms of sexuality.

The school may expel a student for engaging in “un-Islamic behavior and/or religious violations.” Female students are also required to wear a plain white hijab and a loose-fitting jilbab (full-covering religious dress). Boys must have a standard haircut or will not be allowed into class. The admission policy states, “Al-Madinah School has an open door policy for admissions, however, in Islam, discipline is very important. We have a strict code of behavior which must be followed by our students. If the child does not meet our code of Islamic behavior the child will be expelled from the school.”

The school may expel a student for engaging in ‘un-Islamic behavior and/or religious violations.’

The teacher handbook is even more explicit, stating, “Most importantly, we must remember that our mission is to serve Allah first and foremost. As an employee of Al-Madinah School, your goals include serving the Muslim community and the Muslim ummah as a whole.” The employee conduct section instructs, “It is expected that each individual hired will be dedicated to respecting this trust and upholding the principles of Islam.”

Teachers are expected to uphold the high standards of conduct outside of school as well, including social media use. Female teachers are required to wear a hijab: “Your hijab is a form of worship and obedience to Allah SWT.” On this point the handbook quotes the Quran with a version for both men and women: “And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) and not to show off their adornment…”

Women may not wear make-up or decoration and only wear solid colors. Men must also dress in strict ways, and the dress code extends outside of school and on weekends.

Regarding in-class internet usage, “Teachers are responsible to scan every video or website and ensure that the content is appropriate for students and follows the Islamic criteria for sharing information.” Teachers must engage in daily prayers (salah) and a male teacher may not be alone with a female student or a female teacher with a male student. The guideline states, “Islamically, a male and female should never be alone together inside a closed space (classroom, elevator, etc.). Male and female staff members should respect each other’s personal space.” The teacher must agree to these conditions and sign the handbook.

All Religious Require Specific Behavior

What all of these organizations have in common, and that the majority of progressive commentators typically fail to recognize, is a code of behavioral conduct and voluntary acceptance of a specific belief system. Each holds the student, parent, and employee to a specific religious lifestyle, something parents and educators choose to participate in.

The purpose of a private religious school is to allow explicit religious-based education designed to be exempt from secular requirements and obligations. To answer Winterhof from the HRC on why Karen Pence chose a school with strict religious standards: she wanted to work there, just as those who apply to an Orthodox Jewish school or Islamic school choose to participate in and restrict themselves to a certain lifestyle. Strangely, however, only the observant Christian is shamed for doing so.

More specifically, Immanuel Christian School does not ban anyone from attending or working at their school. They require a specific set of behavioral and religious belief standards equally applied to everyone. Many in the Christian world make a distinction regarding LGBT people that the left typically refuses to consider, between a person and his actions.

Stop Imposing the Left’s Morality on Everyone

As with all traditional religious practices, individuals are expected to conform to a code of conduct. Pence and his wife are traditional Christians, and the frightening undertone of the criticism is of progressives advancing state-regulated religious practice. While there is room for discussion about the experience of a young person who is gay or has gender dysphoria in this particular school or any of the others referenced above, it is equally relevant to point out that the school makes it clear it is the rejection of moral conduct and not the person that is at issue.

The frightening undertone of the criticism is of progressives advancing state-regulated religious practice.

The left has grown to feel entitled to impose their worldview onto every conceivable situation and expect those they target to accept their morality. While only Christians are targeted for public shaming, the legal consequences of progressive demands will affect all traditional religious private schools equally. The fate of religious education falls into the hands of the people most intolerant to it, and that should concern all of us.

Despite what the left argues, Christian morality standards are not extreme or dangerous. It is perfectly acceptable to disagree with them calmly, and if you do you would never sign that application. Tolerance largely involves leaving other people alone.

In this, the Pences deserve a break from the near-constant alarm-ringing for moral outrage over their personal religious practice. Furthermore, all religious education systems deserve autonomy and freedom. Regardless of how a person views his or her beliefs, it really isn’t anyone’s business other than those who choose to participate.

Today’s Left Now Openly Aims To Make Christians Second-Class Citizens,"The left wants to penalize Christians for their faith. The most recent example is the freakout over the vice president’s wife, Karen Pence, teaching part-time at a Christian school that holds students and staff to traditional Christian standards of doctrine and conduct, including sexual conduct.

These requirements are not exceptional among Christian schools (and those of other religions often have similar restrictions), but they have been treated as the vilest bigotry, deserving censure and punishment. CNN’s John King even suggested that teaching at this school should mean forfeiting Pence’s government-provided security.

As a practical pastoral matter, the school is almost certainly more focused on fornication and adultery than on denouncing sodomy. But the media is obsessed over the aspects of traditional Christian sexual ethics that relate to LGBT identity and actions.

The Washington Post, for example, flatly asserts that Pence has been hired by an “anti-LGBT Christian school” that “seeks to exclude homosexual and transgender students and staff members”—as an aside, note how LGBT ideology sexualizes children and defines them by their still-developing sense of sexuality—but that is not how traditional Christians view these matters.

Christian Perspectives On Sexual Morality

The Christian perspective distinguishes between, on one hand, same-sex attraction or gender dysphoria as psychological states experienced by individuals, and, on the other, behavior, identity, and ideology. Thus, the reality of same-sex attraction is acknowledged, but considered a temptation to be resisted, not an identity to be embraced. Gender dysphoria, like other sorts of dysphoria, is viewed as an affliction that should be treated with compassion in accord with biological reality, rather than a metaphysical truth to which physical bodies must be molded.

This separation between desire, act, and identity does not necessitate rejecting LGBT identities or actions, just as collapsing the distinctions does not necessarily mean accepting those who identify as LGBT. They are not moral arguments, but only the conceptual framework in which Christian moral arguments are made.

Even if they are mistaken, these basic distinctions between desire, action, and identity are conceptually simple. They have been explained by conservative Christians such as David French, and by those who identify as LGBT, such as fellow Federalist Senior Contributor Chad Felix Greene. Why, then, are they so baffling (even incomprehensible) to many today?

This blindness results from our culture teaching us to identify with our desires and view their fulfillment as the greatest good alongside autonomous self-creation. Saying no to sexual desire, which is among the most powerful of human urges, is therefore seen as repression of an essential aspect of a person’s humanity. The separation of identity and desire makes little sense in this outlook, which sees telling someone not to act on his sexual desires as a rejection of that person’s essence.

This is why there has been such a ferocious response to a Christian school enforcing traditional Christian standards of sexual morality. Prohibiting LGBT identities, actions, and ideologies is seen as either prohibiting an entire class of persons or forcing them to deny their essential selves. This perspective is protected from criticism by both the dominant cultural perspective and the imperatives of being an “ally,” which preclude questioning the claims of those who identify as LGBT. The Christian philosophy of sex, gender, and sexual morality is now culturally alien and even considering it as a possibility is often treated as an act of oppression.

Modern Penal Laws for Dissenters

This is why the left is attempting to establish a modern American version of the penal laws that England used to oppress Irish Catholics and other dissenters. The great Edmund Burke noted that in his time, “If a man is satisfied to be a slave, he may be a Papist with perfect impunity…but he must consider himself as an outlaw from the British Constitution.”

Religious liberty was technically allowed, but those who exercised it in nonconforming ways found their other freedoms curtailed. In Burke’s words, a man’s conscience was made “a trap to catch his liberty.”

This is the strategy being developed by much of the left against many traditional Christians today. The First Amendment protects (for now) our right to believe what we will in our homes and churches, but we will be penalized for our beliefs in the professions, the marketplace, and in government. The horror of many on the left at learning that Christians are still allowed to run their own schools with standards of behavior drawn from traditional Christian teaching—and that the wife of a prominent public official works at such a school—is only the latest example of this campaign.

The litany of assaults on religious liberty has become familiar. Catholic judicial nominees are being cross-examined over membership in the Knights of Columbus. The Obama administration was fixated on forcing nuns to fund and facilitate the distribution of birth control, and blue states took up the cause when Trump was elected. Punishing Christians who predictably decline to participate in celebrating same-sex weddings or “gender transition” events is another obsession.

While they claim to want equality, the left is deliberately establishing a system that will reduce traditional Christians and other religious dissenters to second-class citizenship. Observe how in conflicts between religious liberty and the sexual revolution, leftists seek not to accommodate and tolerate religious nonconformists, but to delegitimize and punish them.

Punishing Orthodox Christians For Obeying God

They are quite clear about their goals for orthodox Christians. They believe we are bigots, and that bigots should not be allowed to run schools, work in government, or hold good jobs. If we will not recant and bend the knee to the sexual revolution, they want to close our schools, hospitals, and charities, drive us out of our professions, shutter our businesses, and get us fired from any job they deem above our station. Although they are willing to use private means and social pressure, their ultimate goal is a legal regime that will treat us very much like the English treated the Irish Catholics.

The Democratic Party, especially its activist base, is eager to “punish the wicked,” by which they often mean conservative Christians. We’ve noticed, which helps explain President Trump. In the primaries, Trump struggled among churchgoing voters, but he cleaned up with them (especially white evangelicals) in the general election. Christian satire site The Babylon Bee hit close to home with a recent article titled, “Christian Just Voting For Whichever Political Party Less Likely To Make His Faith Illegal One Day.”

It may not come to that, but the left is determined to make being an orthodox Christian debilitating and difficult in many ways. In fact, if they have their way, the government will extend its protections and benefits only to those who are willing to subordinate their freedoms of religion, speech, and association to ideologically leftist notions of what is acceptable.

We should, like the Apostle Paul, invoke our legal rights in response. He appealed to the emperor; we should appeal to the government to protect our rights as guaranteed by the Constitution. But constitutional rights will not hold out forever against a culture that sees them as obstacles to self-indulgence and shields for bigotry. A culture that considers sexual desire the essence of a person will not tolerate a rival Christian viewpoint, but stigmatize and punish it.

We must prepare ourselves for entry into many professions and important positions to be contingent on acquiescence to LGBT ideology, and for nonconformists to be targeted for harassment and destruction. For example, despite losing in the Supreme Court, Colorado is still targeting Christian baker Jack Phillips and encouraging harassment against him. The state of Washington not only went after florist Barronelle Stutzman’s business when she declined to help celebrate a same-sex wedding, but attacked her personally.

It won’t work. The punishers will always be unhappy, no matter how many Christian individuals, institutions, and businesses they ruin. Identities built around appetite are intrinsically dissatisfied, and silencing dissenters will not change that.

Socrates taught that it is not worth becoming an unjust and tyrannical person for even the greatest earthly rewards. But for a cake or a bouquet? That is nothing but joyless malice.

Why Are Democrats Fighting The Nomination Of A Qualified Gay Minority?,"On January 23, President Trump announced his intention to re-nominate 51 judicial nominees that were not confirmed before the end of last year.

In November, now-retired senator Jeff Flake “vowed to oppose the president’s judicial nominees until he gets a vote on a bill to protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller from being fired.” As reported by BuzzFeed’s Zoe Tillman in a tweeted story, “California nominees for the 9th Circuit and district courts aren’t on the renomination list — two sources familiar with the situation say [California Sen. Dianne] Feinstein has been in talks with the White House about reconsidering certain names on that list.”

The report indicates that several controversial nominations, as well as all California nominations, were omitted from the updated list. This matters because one important name, among many, is on that original list that should be carefully considered and recognized: Patrick Bumatay.

Carrie Severino wrote a profile on Bumatay’s career that highlights his experience and positions: He is a 40-year-old lawyer working for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California for the Department of Justice. He was previously nominated to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in California. He graduated from Yale University and Harvard Law School and is an active member of the Federalist Society.

He is an originalist in the mold of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch and has worked on the nominations for several Supreme Court judges. If confirmed, he would be the first Filipino-American federal judge and the second openly gay federal judge, the first on the Ninth Circuit.

Patrick Bumatay’s Experience Is Strong

Bumatay currently serves as a counselor to the U.S. attorney general, where he focuses on criminal law issues and policy. He advises the AG on initiatives and policies to combat the national opioid crisis and assists in the oversight of the Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Marshals, Bureau of Prisons, and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. He also serves as a steering committee member on the U.S. Council of Transnational Organized Crime.

He has worked as senior counsel to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (2017-2018) and counsel to the Associate Attorney General Kevin O’Connor (2008-2009). While in private practice with a New York law firm, Bumatay represented an indigent defendant charged with drug trafficking, assisting her in housing and transportation while representing her in court, as well as corporate and individual defendants in criminal and regulatory investigations.

Bumatay has worked as a civil litigator, drafting several motions on behalf of corporate clients. He also managed significant discovery on behalf of clients in civil and regulatory matters. He has argued several cases before courts of appeals and drafted numerous federal appellate briefs. He also authored a petition for certiorari before the U.S. Supreme Court.

Bumatay’s grandfather arrived in California from the Philippines in the 1920s and worked as farm laborer while earning advanced education degrees. His parents are doctors. He and his husband plan a family and he is active in his community. He has been endorsed by the National Filipino American Lawyers Association, the National Asian Pacific Islander Prosecutors Association, and the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association.

Action Speaks Louder than Words

This is all to say that, by any stretch of the imagination, Bumatay should be considered a valuable and diverse asset to the judiciary by the left. So why are Democrats fighting his nomination?

Andrew Chang of San Francisco, California, writing on behalf of the Bay Area Lawyers for Individual Freedom, stated in 2015, “The limited representation of open LGBT judges on the bench affects both LGBTs’ and the public’s perception of LGBTs in society.”

Writing in 2013 for the Huffington Post, Timothy Holbrook, a professor at Emory Law School, stated in an article titled, “Where Are the Gay Federal Appellate Judges?” that, “The conspicuous absence of any openly LGBT nominees to the other federal appellate courts is a concern. It cannot be the case that no qualified LGBT candidates exist.”

The Washington Post criticized Trump for nominating white males to the bench, arguing, “President Trump’s hostility to diversity in his judicial appointments becomes increasingly apparent.” Yet Bumatay faced opposition from Democratic leaders in October 2018 when first nominated. Gregory Angelo, president of Log Cabin Republicans, tweeted:

.@SenFeinstein & @SenKamalaHarris voted against qualified gay nominee @RichardGrenell for Ambassador to Germany. Now they are already on-record opposing qualified gay nominee Patrick Bumatay for the #9thCircuit. Even worse? Both are THEIR CONSTITUENTS. https://t.co/lYNh26PqJb — Gregory T. Angelo (@gregorytangelo) October 17, 2018

Angelo stated in an interview, “Patrick would make an excellent addition to the court…The historic nature of his nomination as an openly gay man adds an additional layer of prestige to what by all counts is an exceptional career in law.”

Hypocrisy By Many On The Left

A spokesperson for California Sen. Kamala Harris stated in reference to the Ninth Circuit nomination that Trump continues to “try to pack the courts with partisan judges who will blindly support the president’s agenda, instead of acting as an independent check on this administration.” USA Today reported that “Bumatay’s nomination angered California’s Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris, who did not include Bumatay’s name among those they recommended for the vacancies on the 9th Circuit.”

It seems that the only thing holding Democrats back from confirming a highly qualified, diverse nominee is their bias against his perceived politics. Despite his active association with many organizations representing many diverse groups, his work defending members of marginalized communities, and his work across many areas of legal expertise, the one thing that seems to be unacceptable to Democrat senators is his conservative judicial and political worldview.

Unfortunately, it may also be preventing him from being re-nominated under Trump’s renewed attempt to confirm judicial nominees. Trump has stood by many of his controversial selections, and hopefully he will do the same when negotiating for California’s judges. Unlike many others on his list, Bumatay is not cited as expressing controversial views or engaging in anything in his legal or academic career that the left objects to besides his politics. He is simply a conservative, and that seems to be enough for Harris and Feinstein to lobby against him.

Diversity must be more than just superficial characteristics and arbitrary quotas used exclusively to support or oppose politicians or other political narratives. Those who advocate for diversity as a specific attribute cannot betray their commitment simply because an individual does not align with their narrow worldview. Intellectual diversity is just as important as characteristic and experience diversity in all areas of life, but especially on courts.

For the right, the only thing that matters is Bumatay’s character, his morals and ethics, his record, his worldview, and his commitment to unbiased judicial consideration in his work. If the left is going to champion unique perspectives from people coming from different backgrounds and argue that members of underrepresented communities need to be promoted, they cannot discriminate against qualifying candidates who just so happen to think differently than they do.

Bumatay was rightfully nominated the first time around and unfairly denied confirmation due to petty politics, and it is important that our political leaders stand behind their nominations and ensure that highly qualified, ethical, unbiased, and conservative judges are confirmed. I hope President Trump fights for Patrick Bumatay and we see him confirmed. He will be an important conservative voice on the appellate court.

Dems Seek To Ban Christianity Using So-Called Anti-Discrimination Laws,"The 86th Texas legislative session got underway a few weeks ago, and liberals are already going on the offense in the traditional conservative stronghold. Left-leaning legislators have formed Texas’ first LGBTQ caucus while promising a “transformative” agenda. This includes a number of proposed “sexual orientation and gender identity” laws (SOGI) that would attack people of faith so aggressively that they can justifiably be described as “Ban the Bible” bills.

“Ban the Bible” doesn’t have to mean confiscating physical Bibles. LGBT activists aren’t that obvious with their intentions (yet). But it does mean something even worse: stripping Texans of their right to practice biblical teachings in their day to day lives.

These bills would create new government power and protections that ban the free expression of biblically grounded beliefs, especially teaching on marriage and sexuality. Numerous bills seek to force people of faith to conform to others’ personal and political activities, while setting aside their own sincerely held religious beliefs. Those who do not comply will face fines, possible jail time, or other criminal charges.

Bigoted Bills Disguised As ‘Anti-Discrimination’

These proposals try to fly under the radar as “anti-discrimination” bills, because who doesn’t want to stop bullying? But such so-called anti-discrimination laws turn law-abiding Christians into criminals and Texans can’t stand by and watch it happen. H.B. 244, for example, creates a $100 per day fine for any violation. H.B. 188 includes a Class A Misdemeanor, the same punishment for a DUI or domestic violence, which could lead to a year in jail if the anti-discrimination policy is not followed.

These policies are similar to ones used against Christian cake baker Jack Philips in Colorado. Jack, of course, famously won at the U.S. Supreme Court, but that wasn’t enough to stop liberals from trying again.

Other bills would force religious homeless shelters, colleges, and universities to allow biological men to sleep next to women. This includes in shelters for abused women and small dormitories. Think that’s a little farfetched? It’s already happening in Alaska.

As if that’s not bad enough, these same bills would be used to force private business owners to allow men into the most intimate spaces designed for women. This includes places like showers and locker rooms at a gym, or any public bathroom. Again, if you think this is farfetched, it has already happened in Seattle, and a Planet Fitness in Michigan revoked membership to a woman who merely complained there was a man in the women’s locker room.

It’s one thing if a corporation wants to voluntarily create SOGI policies for their business. After all, corporate activism seems to be all the rage these days. Target famously changed its bathroom policy to allow guests to use the bathroom of their “gender identity.” They also saw reported incidents of sexual offenses spike in Texas and across the nation right after that policy change. The bills in front of the Texas legislature, however, would force all business to adopt these radical LGBT policies, even those owned by people who oppose them for religious or safety reasons.

But it doesn’t end there. A third bill, H.B. 517, would allow the government to punish counselors, marriage and family therapists, psychologists, or any other mental health providers licensed by the state who help people from a Christian perspective. If these providers in any way discourage homosexual behavior, or the desire for a “gender transition” (including at the request of the client), they would face disciplinary action by a regulatory committee.

It’s truly shocking to see how far the left is willing to go on this issue. This bill frames the issues as “unprofessional conduct by mental health providers who attempt to change the sexual orientation of a child.” Talking to people about what the Bible says and their unwanted feelings now constitutes “unprofessional conduct.”

Real-World Consequences

I hope you have heard about the heartbreaking case out of Dallas where a young boy is dressed like a girl by his mother but acts like a boy with his father. The mother of the child, who is separated from the father, is threatening the father with legal action if he discourages his son’s transgenderism.

This bill goes a step beyond that scenario. Not only would the father not be allowed to discourage transgenderism, but mental health providers would not be allowed to discourage it either! This is the Sherman’s March of SOGI policies, completely clearing the path of any opposition or dissent.

At this point you might be telling yourself there’s no way Texans will let this pass. Unfortunately, I wish that optimism were true. During Texas’ last legislative session, a bill similar to one introduced this year was voted out of committee with Republican support. Austin is not immune to the swamp sickness.

On top of this, Republicans just lost 12 seats in the Texas House in the last election. While Republicans still hold the majority, this session is different, and Texans who care about their liberty can’t take anything for granted.

It’s no secret that Texas is the shining state on a hill for many conservatives across the country. Liberals understand this better than most. This is why Texas is consistently on the front lines fighting to protect liberty. A win for these anti-Christian bills in the Lone Star State would be a mighty morale blow to conservatives across the country.

Just like at the Alamo, Texans must once again stand and fight for our freedoms. We must dare liberals to “Come and Take it!” while we stand firm. If you’re in Texas, please contact your elected officials at NoBibleBan.com and encourage them to oppose these horrible bills. We ask all who care about their values and liberty around the nation to join with us, like the volunteers of old, to protect all that we hold dear.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/01/28/texas-democrats-seek-ban-christianity-using-called-anti-discrimination-laws/,2019-01-28
Progressive Va. School Refuses To Play Sports With Icky Christian Kids,"News media recently attacked second lady Karen Pence for teaching art at a Christian school that requires fidelity to Christian sexual mores from students and staff. Now a progressive private school that used to play athletic games against Pence’s Immanuel Christian School is refusing to play against them at their facility, on grounds that playing basketball at a Christian school makes children “unsafe.” Yes, really.

Rod Dreher quotes an all-school email from Sheridan School Head Jessica Donovan:

Since the majority of students wanted to play, we were initially planning to go to [Immanuel Christian School] with the student-athletes wearing a statement of support (such as rainbow socks or warm-up jerseys). As we talked more, we understood that some students did not feel safe entering a school that bans LGBTQ parents, students or even families that support LGBTQ rights. Forcing our children to choose between an environment in which they feel unsafe or staying home was not an option. So we decided that we would invite ICS to play all of the games at Sheridan. Since ICS declined our offer to host, we will only play our home games and will not go to ICS to play.

When Immanuel kids come to play at Sheridan, Donovan said, her students plan to antagonize the Christian children by plastering LGBT images across their clothing and waving LGBT-celebratory signs during games.

Donovan made a point to cite some Christian schools’ departure from orthodox Christian teaching to cover this obvious display of anti-Christian bigotry: “We shared that people who believe differently from us do not deserve disrespect, and the best way to engage with others is through respect and dialogue. We were clear to separate the ideals of Christianity with the policies of this particular school, as we play many Christian schools that support LGBTQ rights.”

How is it respectful to shame Christian children for the beliefs their families and churches hold? Would Sheridan students ever wear rainbow socks and wave LGBT placards while playing a Muslim or Jewish school and call that “respect and dialogue”? How can one expect children to feel respect when they are not invited to express their views, but made into totems to be publicly shamed simply for their religious beliefs? How is it respectful to create an obviously hostile playing environment for an opposing team?

This is disrespect, hostility, and religious bigotry masquerading under the opposite banner. It is also not an isolated incident. The athletic accreditation bodies for both college and K-12 schools have begun to indicate to Christian schools they’d better abandon their faith or lose their ability to play sports with other institutions.

The NCAA is subject to an internal and external pressure campaign over this issue. States across the nation have begun to threaten Christian schools’ participation in athletic conferences, particularly over transgender athletes.

It’s not just sports, either, it’s academic accreditation and funding on the line, all for simply attempting to maintain their historic Christian identity: “In Prinsburg, Minn., Central Minnesota Christian School, a CSI member, receives federal funds for its hot lunch and Title I programs. Superintendent Pete Van Der Puy said nothing has happened yet, but the school might have to prepare to lose federal funding to stand on its religious beliefs about gender,” reported World Magazine in 2016.

As preferences for LGBT people increasingly become enshrined in laws and regulations, with even Republican politicians like Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb misguidedly leading the charge, expect religious discrimination like this to grow. What an irony that the same kind of law Mike Pence put into place as a Republican governor of Indiana amps up discrimination like this against his own wife’s religious employer.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/01/30/progressive-va-school-refuses-to-play-sports-with-icky-christian-kids/,2019-01-30
Doctors Speak Against Medicine's Lack Of Caution For Trans Kids,"It seems like just yesterday the sexual revolution was focused on legal protections for same-sex couples and individuals with same-sex orientations. But once that battle was won (or lost, depending on your perspective), radicals in the LGBT movement flooded the cultural zone with new demands.

“Gay rights” became yesterday’s cause, replaced by “transgender rights.” The goal was to increase the tiny population of people with gender dysphoria and elevate their problems and demands above those of any other group.

The most troubling agenda item for the transgender radicals became the demand that dysphoric children be provided medical intervention to help their bodies mimic those of the opposite sex. Such interventions can include puberty blockers (which disrupt the natural maturation of the body), cross-sex hormones (which flood the body with hormones natural to the opposite sex), and surgery to remove healthy but unwanted reproductive organs and perhaps to craft faux organs natural to the opposite sex.

These treatments are controversial even among the “LGBs” in the LGBT alliance, in part because plentiful research demonstrates that the vast majority of children with dysphoria will outgrow it without receiving dangerous and potentially irreversible treatment. Their concerns are shared by the self-described “left-leaning, open-minded, and pro-gay rights” group youthtranscriticalprofessionals.org. These professionals warn that “policies that encourage––either directly or indirectly––such medical treatment for young people who may not be able to evaluate the risks and benefits are highly suspect, in our opinion.”

Despite the recklessness of administering such “gender-affirming treatment,” many physicians have either jumped on the bandwagon (whether out of fear, ideology, or lust for financial reward) or have kept a discreet silence lest they be targeted for apostasy. And when they join or otherwise enable the mob, lives can literally be ruined.

Presumably all physicians understand the biological reality that there are only two sexes, and that an individual cannot change his or her chromosomes to shift from one to the other. Hormone levels can be raised or lowered and mutilating surgery can be performed, but the patient is still left with a cheap (or rather, highly expensive) imitation of the real thing.

Given this reality and the dearth of long-term studies on the effects of hormone manipulation, one would expect reputable physicians to urge caution, at the very least, in administering these treatments. One would be wrong.

Polarization Within the Profession

An early warning indicator of the politicization within the profession came from the American Medical Association, which in 2008 went on record supporting increased access to hormonal and surgical treatment for patients suffering from the recognized mental disorder then known as gender identity disorder. This was followed five years later by the new edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), changing gender identity disorder to gender dysphoria. According to one psychiatrist who helped write the new criteria, the goal was to move toward viewing transgender identification as a normal variation of sexual orientation.

These attitudinal changes in the medical environment fertilized the soil for the sudden blooming of “transgender clinics,” many connected with hospitals. Such clinics are designed to help the rapidly multiplying number of gender dysphoric patients get medical alterations and, by happy coincidence, create a lucrative new specialty for physicians willing to push the Hippocratic envelope.

Since the new normal involves treating the psychological condition of gender dysphoria with hormones and hormone-disrupting drugs, endocrinologists are at the center of the controversial new practices. The Endocrine Society, which purports to speak for medical professionals in hormone research and the clinical practice of endocrinology, has signaled that its members should ride the gender dysphoria wave regardless of concerns about safety and ethics. The Endocrine Society’s clinical practice guidelines on the treatment of dysphoria for both adults and children, first published in 2009 and then in revised form in 2017, suggest a dangerous elevation of political ideology over sound medical practice.

The guidelines are based on those issued by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), a political advocacy organization that masquerades as an association of health-care professionals (no medical credentials are required for membership). WPATH envisions “a world wherein people of all gender identities and gender expressions have access to evidence-based healthcare, social services, justice and equality.” The organization thus exists not to slow down the train of radical treatment for gender dysphoria but rather to rev up the engine.

Following WPATH’s lead, the Endocrine Society guidelines give a nod to the need for “safe and effective” hormone regimens for patients suffering from gender dysphoria. But the guidelines never acknowledge that no one really knows what’s “safe and effective” in this context, or even what those words mean.

Does “safe” indicate there are no irreversible side effects, or only that the hormone treatments don’t kill the patient? Does “effective” mean they fully convert the girl into a boy or the boy into a girl, or only that they make one sex look more like the other? Are safety and effectiveness achieved as long as the patient is no more suicidal after the treatment than he or she was before?

Involving Mental Health Professionals

Having glided over these problems, the guidelines also mention the advisability of involving a mental health professional in the diagnosis of dysphoria. But what if that doesn’t happen? Some physicians, such as the radical activist Dr. Johanna Olson-Kennedy in California, see no more need for a psychological evaluation in this case than in the case of a child who needs insulin. Or what if the evaluation is the cursory “check the box” assessment complained of by many parents trying to protect their confused children from this medical-political cabal? The guidelines are silent.

As for the actual hormone treatment, the guidelines recommend that a gender dysphoric child who begins showing signs of puberty should be placed on GnRH analogues such as Lupron (otherwise known as puberty blockers). There is no mention of the sometimes devastating side effects, and even the irreversibility, of such drugs.

When the adolescent goes on to request cross-hormone treatment (and patients who receive puberty blocking always go on to request cross-sex hormones, unlike up to 98 percent of patients who do not), the guidelines do mention the irreversible nature of the treatment, particularly permanent loss of fertility. So do they warn physicians not to do such a terrible thing to a teenager? No. They merely recommend administering a “gradually increasing dose” of the hormones to those teens who have “sufficient mental capacity to give informed consent.” What teens would those be? Those who are…16 years old.

So the Endocrine Society thinks a 16-year-old who is too immature to vote or join the army should be able to make the life-altering, and perhaps life-destroying, decision to give up the joys of children and family. (The guidelines do recommend counseling about “options for fertility preservation,” another subject beyond the capacity of a 16-year-old to even comprehend, much less make decisions about.)

As for the known side effects of using puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to alter natural development rather than to treat illness or dysfunction––side effects such as decreased bone mineral density and increased cancer risk––the guidelines recommend that the professional team keep a lookout. Don’t stop it, and don’t take responsibility for having started it, just recognize it when you see it.

The truly disturbing aspect of the Endocrine Society’s conduct with respect to these guidelines is the admitted lack of good evidence for them. Consider the summary by Dr. Monique Robles, a pediatric critical care physician who explored the guidelines and their implementation at a transgender clinic she visited:

When I asked about the protocols used at the clinic, I learned they are not standardized, because not enough conclusive studies have been done. The Endocrine Society published their clinical practice guideline for gender dysphoria in 2017, which consists of twenty-eight recommendations. Each recommendation is graded by the strength (strong or weak) and the quality (very low, low, moderate, or high) of the evidence for it. Twenty-one percent of the recommendations are “ungraded good practice statements.” Of the graded recommendations, 45 percent have strong evidence and 55 percent have weak. In terms of the quality of evidence, 23 percent have very low quality evidence, 63 percent have low quality, and 14 percent have moderate. None of the recommendations is supported by high-quality evidence.

In other words, the Endocrine Society is sailing in uncharted seas. The people who will be swept overboard when the waves crash are innocent kids who have no idea what they’re doing and depend on supposed adults to protect them from their impulses. Those adults are in short supply.

Some Physicians Dissent

But not every physician has been cowed into submission by the LGBT bullies. Doctors in the American College of Pediatricians (ACPeds) can be described as profiles in courage, as can intrepid psychiatrists who bravely point out the naked emperor who seems to have seized control of the medical profession. Most recently, a group of endocrinologists have dared to challenge the politicized insanity in their own professional organization.

Their objections take the form of a letter to the editor of the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (JCEM). In that letter Dr. Michael Laidlaw, Quentin Van Meter, Paul W. Hruz, Andre Van Mol, and William J. Malone lay out the case against the “gender affirmative treatment” (GAT) advocated by the Endocrine Society:

The consequences of this . . . GAT are not trivial and include potential sterility, sexual dysfunction, thromboembolic and cardiovascular disease, and malignancy. Children with GD will outgrow this condition in 61-98% of cases by adulthood. There is currently no way to predict who will desist and who will remain dysphoric. The degree to which GAT has contributed to the rapidly increasing prevalence of GD in children is unknown. The recent phenomenon of teenage girls suddenly developing GD – Rapid Onset GD – without prior history through social contagion is particularly concerning.

When physicians have administered puberty blockers to help adolescent patients “buy time” to affirm their gender incongruence, “they simply ‘bought’ themselves lower bone density and the need for lifelong medical therapy.”

Patients treated with puberty blockers according to the guidelines (the vast majority of whom do not even attempt fertility preservation) “will have no prospect of biological offspring while on HDCS hormones and continuing on to gonadectomy.”

Cross-sex hormone treatments as recommended by the guidelines are associated with “increased ovarian cancer risk and metabolic abnormalities” in women and a five-fold increase in venous thromboembolism risk in males.

The health consequences of GAT are highly detrimental, the stated quality of evidence in the guidelines is low, and diagnostic certainty is poor. Furthermore, limited long-term outcome data fail to demonstrate long-term success in suicide prevention.

Given these undeniable medical and psychological risks of GAT, the physicians question how any child, adolescent, or parent can give truly informed consent. Moreover, “[h]ow can the physician ethically administer GAT knowing that a significant number of patients will be irreversibly harmed?”

The physicians call for randomized controlled clinical trials “to establish and validate the safety and efficacy of alternative treatment approaches for this vulnerable patient population.” In the meantime, they urge reliance on existing care models based on psychotherapy, which “have been shown to alleviate GD in children, thus avoiding the radical changes and health risks of GAT” – doing “the least harm with the most benefit.”

The doctors conclude by calling for a return to objective medicine in this highly charged political arena:

Physicians need to start examining GAT through the objective eye of the scientist-clinician rather than the ideological lens of the social activist. Far more children with gender dysphoria will ultimately be helped by this approach.

So these physicians have thrown down the gauntlet and are presumably bracing for the inevitable backlash from ideologues. But there’s safety in numbers, and their courage may catalyze more professional opposition to the politicization and corruption of medicine. Perhaps this resistance will expand to include all people, physicians and otherwise, of all ideological stripes, who will finally rise up to protect children from those who would sacrifice them as pawns in a political battle.

NYC Bans People From Talking To A Therapist About Discomfort With Sex,"Perhaps it was inevitable: New York City has now banned therapists from helping those with gender dysphoria to accept the sex of their natural bodies and from assisting those with unwanted same-sex attractions to overcome their unwelcome desires.

Per a law passed last year, it is now illegal for a hired therapist to “seek to change a person’s sexual orientation or seek to change a person’s gender identity to conform to the sex of such individual that was recorded at birth.” This law is being challenged in court by an Orthodox Jewish psychotherapist, who contends that it violates his rights and those of his adult patients, most of whom share his faith.

New York’s Meddling Is Inappropriate

He is right. This law inhibits free speech and the free exercise of religion while attempting to force identities on people that they do not want. It seeks to lock people into aspects of their personality that they do not wish to preserve, and that conflict with what they believe to be their essential identity. It deprives people of professional assistance in their pursuit of the sexual and gender identities and expressions that they desire to have.

So much for personal autonomy. The people loudly proclaiming that consenting adults should be free to do whatever they want with each other sexually, however violent or degrading it may appear, have decreed that ordinary therapy—consisting of talking and listening—must be banned if it seeks to help the patient achieve a desired change in sexual orientation or gender identity.

Why? What business is it of the NYC government if, for example, a woman with gender dysphoria wishes to reconcile herself to her natural body, and hires a therapist to help? Defenders of the law may argue that “conversion therapy” is ineffective and harmful, and that their goal is to ensure quality, scientific medical care and therapy. They are liars and hypocrites.

A quick internet search shows that the Big Apple is inundated with providers of acupuncture, crystal healing, and the rest of the holistic and alternative “medicine” parade of frauds and shysters. Nor is there a shortage of dubious therapists. For instance, those with a taste for combining bad metaphysics and bad psychology can engage in past life regression therapy. In New York City, a therapist can tell a man with gender dysphoria that he is a reincarnation of Napoleon, but not that he is a man.

The New York City government is not interested in clearing out quacks and charlatans; it wants to drive out religious nonconformists. This attack on the First Amendment rights of religious minorities is both inconsistent and unconstitutional.

Supporters of laws like NYC’s often caricature their targets as engaged in “Clockwork Orange”-style aversion therapy, or “pray the gay away” religious indoctrination. But that is not the norm now (if it ever was), nor is it what the plaintiff in this case does. He simply listens to his patients and speaks to them. To prohibit this voluntary practice of therapeutic dialogue, supporters of the law must declare that gender identity and sexual orientation are intrinsic, and that any attempt to modify them is so harmful that the state must interfere.

Fluid Identities That Change?

However, LGBT advocates have for years proclaimed that sexual orientation and gender identity exist along a spectrum and are often fluid. For examples, recall the Gender Unicorn and the Genderbread Person, bits of LGBT propaganda designed to teach children that gender identity, gender expression, biological sex, physical attraction, and emotional attraction are all separate attributes that fall along a spectrum.

A necessary corollary of this dogma of fluidity along spectrums is that sexual orientation and gender identity are not entirely intrinsic and immutable but, to some degree, changeable. This comports with science, art, and experience, which all testify that our desires and identities are shaped by the complex interactions between our biology, circumstances, culture, and choices.

Therefore, it is possible that therapeutic efforts to influence them could succeed, which means a patient may reasonably request such efforts. For example, a bisexual man who is married to a woman might wish to get therapy to help keep his same-sex desires in check in order to remain faithful to his wife. But NYC has made this illegal.

Nor would these therapeutic efforts necessarily oppose LGBT identities. A gender-nonconforming gay man might seek therapy to reaffirm his identity as a man, rather than as a trans woman—one of the overlooked aspects of the trans movement is that it pressures gender-nonconformists to identity as trans—but this sort of therapeutic affirmation is also illegal in NYC.

Recognizing the injustice and inconsistency of the new law does not require accepting broad critiques of LGBT identity, such as those traditional Christians or Orthodox Jews might make. Nor does validating those who identity as LGBT does require closing therapeutic options for those who do not wish to identify as such.

The freedom to define one’s sexual and gender identities must include the freedom to define them in ways that LGBT advocates dislike and have personally rejected. This freedom requires that therapists remain free to assist patients in their efforts to define their gender and sexual identity as they wish. The commissars of New York City should not dictate to people which parts of their identity they must preserve.

If people are to be free to live according to their authentic selves, they must be free to abandon LGBT identities if they so choose, and to obtain therapeutic help in shaping their identities in accord with their convictions.

Activists Demand Companies Advertise LGBT Behaviors Or Lose Ranking,"It’s due out any day now: the 2019 Corporate Equality Index published by the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group.

This will be the 17th edition of the index, a publication that purports to measure the degree of major corporations’ preferences for gay, lesbian, and transgender employees. In the 2018 edition, 609 businesses responded to HRC’s survey and earned 100 percent ratings based on their criteria, and were designated a “Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality,” earning recognition in that year’s report.

In addition, using publicly available information, HRC ranks all Fortune 500 companies. Last year, the average Fortune 500 company scored a 70 percent on their criteria. But what’s particularly interesting is the gap between survey participants (344) and others: the former had an index of 93, and the latter 13.

Companies Must Constantly Adapt to Stay Tolerated

What’s more, this index is remarkable in not merely measuring LGBTQ policies but at driving changes. Here’s how: the requirements needed to achieve a perfect score are communicated clearly ahead of time. They change periodically, with demands being ratcheted up. Not wanting to lose that perfect score, corporations change their policies in lockstep to meet those demands.

For example, to receive a perfect score in 2018, a corporation needed to only have fully equivalent same- and opposite-sex spousal benefits, although with the requirement that benefit booklets and the like clearly communicate that both classes are covered. However, for 2019, “to account for full family diversity” corporations must provide domestic partner benefits for both same- and opposite-sex domestic partners.

In 2018, corporations were required to offer coverage for sex-reassignment surgeries in at least one medical plan. In 2019, that requirement applies to all medical plans a company offers. And companies with pre-existing “supplier diversity” programs for minority vendors must now include LGBTQ diversity and “outreach to LGBTQ-owned businesses” in their program.

This isn’t the first time they’ve made changes. In 2016, they added requirements that corporations adopt sexual orientation and gender identity preferences globally and that corporations require their contractors to abide by the same policies. More significantly, they added a requirement prohibiting company philanthropic giving to non-religious organizations that have a written policy of considering sexual orientation or gender identity.

Yes, you guessed it, companies which donate to the Boy Scouts of America will lose their perfect score, because the BSA permits local chartering organizations to choose whether they believe it would be appropriate for gay or lesbian adults to be leaders in their troops, packs, and crews.

What’s more, have you noticed that TV ads are increasingly likely to feature same-sex couples, and corporations are increasingly likely to promote their support of LGBTQ causes? That’s in the criteria too––a “public commitment,” in which either “marketing or advertising to LGBTQ consumers (e.g., advertising with LGBTQ content, advertising in LGBTQ media or sponsoring LGBTQ organizations and events)” or “philanthropic support of at least one LGBTQ organization or event (e.g., financial, in-kind or pro bono support)” is required.

To prevent any repeat of the firestorm at Mozilla, their final criteria says that “employers will have 25 points deducted from their score for a large-scale official or public anti-LGBTQ blemish on their recent records.”

Norms Are Being Shifted Before Our Eyes

This sort of thing is very powerful. By setting a norm and getting buy-in from corporations that “good” companies follow that norm, they have gotten corporations to accept a restriction against making donations to the Boy Scouts, even if they otherwise might have, because their perfect score is more important, and to act with trepidation around any event that would be deemed a “blemish.” Really, the skillfulness of the whole endeavor is impressive, even if not the outcome.

And it’s just one of a growing number of ways in which activists are creating a norm for corporate and civic culture that extends beyond tolerance, and labels traditional Christian beliefs “bigotry.” When second lady Karen Pence’s employment at Immanuel Christian School, an evangelical school with a moral code for families and employees, was reported earlier this month, the outrage was swift. Even within the confines of a religious community, these beliefs were unacceptable.

The Twitter mob didn’t hesitate to condemn her and the school, with some accounts stating without hesitation that, however much Pence and the school might be given religious freedom by the Constitution, they would use their freedom of speech to target and ostracize anyone who holds those beliefs, in order to ban them from civil society every bit as much as white supremacists.

Last week, both The Federalist and Rod Dreher at The American Conservative reported that a Washington D.C. private school, Sheridan School, which plays in the same athletic league, announced that they would no longer play games hosted by Immanuel (it was unclear whether they were willing to forfeit the games or whether they expected to pressure the league into removing any potential penalties).

Watching these events play out, as well as a long list of others, it becomes harder and harder to envision that end result in which Christians are left to practice their religion in peace so long as civil marriage is opened up to same-sex couples. What happens next, I can’t even begin to guess.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/02/05/activists-demand-companies-advertise-lgbt-behaviors-lose-ranking/,2019-02-05
"Even Though I Feel Non-Binary, Identifying As My Sex Makes Sense","The LGBT term “non-binary” has been popping up lately, from Vox’s tribute to women and non-binary photographers, to states like Washington allowing a third gender option (X) for birth certificates and driver’s licenses. The Washington law defines the “X” gender designation as, “A gender that is not exclusively male or female, including, but not limited to, intersex, agender, amalgagender, androgynous, bigender, demigender, female-to-male, genderfluid, genderqueer, male-to-female, neutrois, nonbinary, pangender, third sex, transgender, transsexual, Two Spirit, and unspecified.”

The most common and widely used definition of “non-binary” is “genderqueer,” which indicates the full spectrum of people who do not identify as either male nor female––people who identify as some blending of both or people with other concepts of alternative gender.

What Do All These Terms Mean?

Truthfully, the differences between the stated categories are minimal. For example, agender, androgynous, neutrois, and nonbinary all describe the same sensation of having no gender, when compared to male and female. Amalgagender, bigender, demigender, genderfuid, pangender, third sex, and Two Spirit indicate some blending of the two sexes to one degree or another.

The other options indicate a transition from one gender to the other, although modern transgender messaging insists that none of the above listed options are finite or reliably defined. It comes down to the individual and his or her own preferences at any given time. While members of the LGBT community argue these classifications of human gender and sexuality are separate, distinct, and natural conditions of humanity, the reality is they are simply detailing what has always been understood as individuality. Not all people experience all things in the same way.

As someone with direct experience in this introspective analysis, I believe these distinctions are fairly irrelevant to normal, everyday life. It is puzzling to me to see the concept as dramatically expressed as it is by LGBT media and advocacy. Gender conformity matters more in childhood than it does in adulthood as it seems, regardless of the efforts of the adults around them, children self-segregate into male and female peer groups.

This was particularly challenging for me as a child, because I identified with my female classmates more closely than my male classmates. I was daily aware how unlike the other boys I was was. Left on my own, I played with the girls, talked with the teachers, and gravitated towards the girls’ toy selection. My favorite colors were pink and yellow, and I drew princesses and flowers constantly.

My perception was always that girls had easier and more enjoyable social experiences, and male behavior expectations were tedious and absurd to me. I simply did not understand why everyone wanted me to change my behavior––everything from the way I talked to my body language to my personal interests––to be more like the boys, whom I viewed as idiot barbarians.

I did not understand the social hierarchy or interactions in the male world, from my own peer group to teenagers to adult male gatherings. Leave me with a group of middle-aged women, however, and I was right at home. I found female dress, makeup, hair, and jewelry fascinating, and I thought I was a girl trapped in a boy’s body well into my late teens and early twenties.

Despite All This, I Know I’m Male

Masculinity always felt like a set of skills I needed to learn but could never really understand. I fixated on masculine behaviors and attempted to mimic them, but it always felt like acting. On the other side of the spectrum, my attempts to dress as a woman, change my voice, or imagine a female version of my name felt equally fabricated and forced. When left alone, I was more or less, well, non-binary.

In all honesty, I cannot articulate what it means to feel like either a man or a woman. I can list gender stereotypes I have learned from media and observation. I can go into great detail about the differences in psychology and behavior I have studied in both sexes my entire life. But I simply cannot tell you what either feels like personally. It’s all mimicry and acting to me. When I am “myself,” I do not feel a sense of gender at all, and find that the perception of masculinity or femininity depends on who I am around.

The point of this observation is to illustrate what those on the trans spectrum articulate to one degree or another and to humanize the experience. For me, strict gender stereotyping is unnatural. I have absolutely no idea if most people understand that concept, but from my interactions, I have concluded that most people seem to have a pretty clear idea of what male or female means to them. It is equally possible that those who transition experience just as strong a personal knowing as the majority of the population. I can only speak to my own perceptions. But I can objectively tell you I am male.

I know I am a male because of my anatomy and regardless of how I have felt about my body, my social interactions, or my personal sense of self, I am a human male. There are people born with bodily anomalies that make this distinction legitimately difficult, and it is true that not every person has either XX or XY chromosomes.

But the objective reality is that the vast majority of people are either male or female and feel unquestionably as one or the other. This really brings me to my point on the relevancy of gender identity in the abstract. Regardless of how I have felt over time or my internal sense today, the fact remains that my body is male and that is the sex I should abide by in terms of legal classification and interactions with sex-segregated situations. Why? Because it simply makes sense.

My health indicators are male. If I experience a heart attack, I will have the symptoms of a male. Even if I pump myself full of estrogen and testosterone blockers, my body will forever attempt to reestablish itself as male. To this end, the concept of a third sex for identification purposes is irrational. It is also completely ineffective.

What possible point would there be for me to put “X” on my driver’s license when my sex is not controversial to the casual observer? Even if I dressed in stereotypical female clothing, it would not alter my physical anatomy. The fact that I do not experience a specific gender in no way affects my sexual orientation, either. In truth, my sense of gender does not affect anything in my life outside of an awareness of not fitting in with conventional sex-segregated social activities.

Outward Gender Expression

I choose to wear male clothing because I look ridiculous in female clothing. It really is as simple as that. In truth, the most common outward expression of genderqueer individuals seems to be adopting stereotypical aspects of the opposite sex. In our culture, this is a perfectly acceptable option. It just is not one I choose.

I advocate for adults who do choose to express themselves using the full palette of style, fashion, and accessories in any way they like. But I find it unnecessarily confrontational to demand specialized protections, designations, laws, or mandatory pronouns in order to do so. Our culture of self-obsession has made an interesting quirk about a person far more burdensome than it should be. Growing up is hard for everyone, but as an adult you get to be whomever you choose. We should celebrate that rather than complain that not everyone acknowledges it in the precise way we wish.

I think the biggest shift in mindset for me came when things like how I personally experienced gender were no longer priorities. Building a career, battling through a serious illness, and starting my life with a new person changed my perspective on introspection. Spend enough time in your own head, and you’ll find a remarkable number of things to fixate worry on. It’s when you live outside of yourself and experience life with others that these things lose their importance.

I think that is the difference between being genderqueer and having gender dysphoria. One allows you to explore how you wish to express yourself, while the other becomes an unhealthy obsession that limits your ability to function without intervention. Much of the LGBT community is sadly pushing self-exploration into unhealthy obsession.

I also have lost the need to be validated for my gender as either a man or a woman. I recognized that most men think I am feminine, and most women think I am perfect. I like who I am, and I gave up trying to be somebody else.

The left will continue to designate ever more slight differences in experience and perception under labels they demand require special treatment and protections. But in the end, it is simply the progressive way of attempting to understand individuality. For most of us, the categories are truly meaningless in everyday life.

Activists Teach Judges To Yank Kids From Parents Who Won't Trans Them,"On Thursday, the Health and Human Services committee of the South Dakota House killed a bill that would have protected the right of parents to refuse to consent to medical or psychological treatment for a child suffering from gender dysphoria if the treatment “would induce, confirm, or promote the child’s belief that the child’s sex or gender identity is different from the child’s sex presented at birth.” Proposed House Bill 1205 also provided that “no public authority or official of this state may take any adverse action against a parent for exercising this right.”

That such a simple affirmation of parental rights could not clear a committee in this solidly red state should terrify parents, as it lays bare transgender activists’ plan: use the government to force parents to affirm a false sex for their child, agree to hormone blockers, and accept a transition to their son or daughter’s preferred gender. If parents refuse? Removal of the child from the family, due to alleged medical neglect.

We are already seeing the first two waves of this strategy, according to Dr. Michelle Cretella, executive director of the American College of Pediatricians. The first wave began in 2016 in the divorce and child custody setting, Cretella explained.

“I first began hearing from distraught parents in this situation in 2016 and in 2017, I heard from seven families in as many different states in this situation. In all but one case the child was a 15 year-old girl who never had any sexual identity confusion prior to her parent’s divorce,” Cretella said. “The other case involved 4-year-old triplet boys whose mother desperately wanted a girl. The mother was a psychologist herself and had cross-dressed one of the boys for two years, insisting that it was his idea. In each of the seven cases the guardian ad litems and judges removed the right to medical consent and/or custody from the parent who objected to transition with puberty blockers and hormones.”

The Second Wave

We have since moved on to the second wave, Cretella told The Federalist. “The second wave is going on now, with emergency room staff, therapists, or doctors reporting parents to Child Protective Services who refuse to affirm their child’s false gender.”

More recently, Cretella explains, she has heard from two sets of parents who were accused of being “abusive parents” for refusing to consent to hormone treatments for their teen children. In one case, the parents sought treatment for their son’s suicidal depression. Their son was adopted out of an abusive family, had a long history of depression and anxiety, had been in therapy in the past, was on medications, and never had any sign of gender dysphoria.

Nevertheless, the emergency room physician at the children’s hospital, after interviewing him alone, diagnosed him as “definitely transgender because he insists that he is and that [the parents’] lack of acceptance is causing his suicidal depression. He should be started on puberty blockers and estrogen to transition.”

This was the first time the 14-year-old boy had ever said such a thing, Cretella noted, yet from this one ER visit, his parents had to fight with the children’s hospital for months against allegations of being “abusive and unsupportive” parents. The family finally found a therapist who helped them set boundaries with their son, and his complaints of feeling trapped in the wrong body have stopped. Even with this outcome, attorneys told the parents they could not sue because experts would side with the ER physician, who was following the “standard of care” guidelines.

The third wave will be here soon, according to Cretella, when schools trigger investigations into parents of children suffering from gender dysphoria, by reporting children “afraid to come out to their parents as their authentic selves.” We can see this wave forming from the multitude of school protocols in the news, such as allowing students from K-12 to choose their gender identity.

The end goal is the same, Cretella said: “removal of a child based on accusations of medical neglect.”

FOIA Documents Provide Evidence

Documents recently obtained from the Rhode Island Family Court in response to a FOIA request give credence to Cretella’s warning. In late 2015—the year before Cretalla first began receiving calls from concerned parents—the Rhode Island Family Court’s Annual Judicial Conference focused on transgendered children. The lead presenter at the judicial conference was Dr. Michelle Forcier.

Forcier “is considered an expert on transgender, queer and questioning youth” and is an associate professor of pediatrics at the Brown University Alpert Medical School. Forcier spoke to attendees at the judicial conference—dozens of state employees, including Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) workers, employees of the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF), and judges—for nearly an hour and a half.

The Rhode Island deputy legal counsel who responded to the FOIA request confirmed that no audio or video recording exists of the conference or of Forcier’s presentation on transgender youth. When asked about the focus of Forcier’s presentation, Judge Sandra Lanni, who organized the conference at the request of the now-retired chief judge of the Rhode Island Family Court, said through a spokesman that “I thought of it as: How do we as judges understand these kids?”

Lanni added that she did not see the doctor’s presentation as any kind of advocacy for a particular course of action and recalled Forcier discussing different approaches to transgender youth, from waiting it out to delaying onset of puberty with hormone treatment, to active counseling and therapy when the behavior is “consistent, insistent, and persistent” with a child who starts early and never stops.

Forcier may not advocate for any “particular course of action,” since her clinic applies, as she put it, “very individualized (not one-size-fits-all) care to each youth and family, in the context of achieving their goals and with their safety, health and short- and long-term well-being in mind.” But her perspective on children suffering from gender dysphoria is one-sided and holds that transgender children must receive opposite-sex health care.

In fact, in a Washington Post interview, Forcier suggests that failing to provide opposite-sex health care is unethical. “How ethical is it to negate a person’s identity — to tell them you know them better than they do?” Forcier asked rhetorically when responding to criticism of the transgender-affirming model. “How ethical is it to deny a person access to medication that is very safe, effective and proven to help persons with gender nonforming/diverse brain/identity and body experiences?”

The AAP Statement

Last fall, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a policy statement similarly recommending this “gender-affirming” approach and providing youth “access to comprehensive gender-affirming and developmentally appropriate health care.” But as Dr. James Cantor explained in his detailed analysis of the AAP policy statement, “almost all clinics and professional associations in the world use what’s called the watchful waiting approach to helping GD children, [but] the AAP statement rejected that consensus, endorsing only gender affirmation.”

Even more appalling than the AAP’s one-sided approach to gender dysphoria is the fact, exposed by Cantor, that the research used to justify the policy “simply did not say what AAP claimed they did.” The materials provided attendees of the Rhode Island Judicial Conference also included this one-sided perspective, which treats “sex” as something “assigned at birth” as opposed to biologically determined. Handouts included a “What Every Attorney Representing Youth Needs to Know” flyer created by the Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders (GLAAD), which included directions such as “Don’t assume someone’s gender identity,” and “Make sure you know your client’s preferred pronouns.”

Another GLAAD handout, entitled “Rights of LGBTQ Youth in Rhode Island,” proclaimed that students “must have access to information and resources about LGBT issues and people, regardless of objecting school officials or parents.” It also said “transgender youth have the right to be identified by the name and pronouns that accord with their gender identities” and “be free from religious indoctrination that condemns or disparages their sexual orientation or gender identity.”

Attendees of the Rhode Island Family Court conference also received copies of two chapters from the book “Transgender Family Law.” These chapters made clear that affirmation and transition are the end goal for therapists, social workers, lawyers, and the courts. Parents affirming a false gender are called “supportive” parents, while those holding to their child’s biological sex are called the “resistant” parent. Even supportive parents are cautioned to move slowly with any transition lest the resistant parent seek and obtain custody.

The CASA and DCYF employees and judges who attended the Rhode Island Family Court conference also left with a handout of contacts who would support children suffering from gender dysphoria and a list of medical providers compiled by Youth Pride, a local LGBTQ youth center. None of the materials provided, however, mentioned support available from the American College of Pediatricians or doctors recommended by that national pediatricians’ organization.

Unlike the AAP, the American College of Pediatricians rejects affirmation of a false sex and believes “ethics alone demands an end to the use of pubertal suppression with GnRH agonists, cross-sex hormones, and sex reassignment surgeries in children and adolescents.” The American College of Pediatricians also recommends an immediate cessation of these interventions and instead maintains that health care services should be anchored to the physical reality of an individual’s biological sex.

All Part of a Pattern

While the one-sided transgender information provided to the CASA and DCYF employees and judges may seem an isolated occurrence, parents need to recognize that such outreach is intentional. While the public relations spokesman for the Rhode Island Family Courts saw Forcier’s presentation as providing “exposure” to the topic of transgender youth, which he explained is typical of the Family Court’s annual fall conferences, several of the FOIA documents provided called the presentation a “training session” and a survey specifically asked whether attendees had learned “best practices.”

Forcier’s comments during a question and answer portion of the national conference for the United States Professional Association for Transgender Health (USPATH), held a little more than a year after her presentation to the Rhode Island Family Courts, provides further insight into the aim of Forcier’s training session. As first reported by 4thWaveNow, “a community of parents & others concerned about the medicalization of gender-atypical youth rapid-onset gender dysphoria,” a clinical psychologist from a Missouri gender clinic asked whether there was precedent for forcing parents to administer puberty blockers.

Forcier replied: “Yeah, there’s no precedent but you can again work with the child protection team for medical neglect. Work with one parent…at least to get things started. And again, you can do some education. We did education with judges in Rhode Island. So we spent a half day with family court judges, basically telling them this is what gender and transgender is…and it’s been deeply helpful with DCYF and our trans population.”

Dr. Johanna Olson-Kennedy, a California physician who specializes in transgendering youth, concurred. “We work really hard to bring both parents in and bring them both on board,” Olson-Kennedy told the questioner, “so it’s not my first line to go to court to get somebody what they need. But it is my second line and I will do it.”

Another session at the end of the USPATH conference exposed the breadth of this approach, when presenters Elizabeth Burke, Matthew Oransky, and Sarah McGrew discussed handling parents who weren’t on board with “gender care.”­­

And the final piece on suicidality is family non-acceptance. This is where you have a family who is saying, no, no, no…and then you realize that actually the family is contributing to some of that negativity at home. So the family is creating a toxic environment. And that’s where we have let the young person know the potential ramifications of calling DHS and saying that this is an unsafe environment. And that we’ve given the family every chance. To learn, to grow. And they’re continuing to be part of the problem. So thankfully this was an important time when I realized it was worthwhile in starting the clinic at children’s hospital to have lots of meetings with the lawyers in risk management. To be able to say, ‘alright. I have the ethicist, I have the lawyer, I have the guru from risk management, I’m gonna sit down and say, I need to describe a case to you and make sure this is actually parents being negligent in the healthcare needs of their child. Thankfully we’ve had a lot of support in that realm. Because of the trainings we’ve done with [Department of Human Services] DHS workers in Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. DHS workers will go and say you’re creating an unsafe environment for your child. And we need to have that stop.…unfortunately staying in that home environment is going to result in a child’s suicide.

Attempts to locate the material provided in these training sessions through FOIA requests to Delaware and Pennsylvania proved unsuccessful––no documents were located in the search for training materials on transgender youth and no communications with, or about, the three presenters (Burke, Oransky, and McGrew) were found. But whatever training these individuals provided seemingly worked because DHS will apparently claim non-affirmation of a child suffering from gender dysphoria is medical neglect justifying the child’s removal from the home.

With transgender activists indoctrinating CASA and child-protective services workers (and potentially judges) on what LGBT activists maintain is the only standard of care for children with gender dysphoria, it will not be long before these troubled children will be removed as a matter of course from loving parents whose only crime is believing there is a better way than lying about their children’s true sex, shooting them up with drugs, rendering them sterile, and eventually mutilating them.

That is unless everyday Americans can come together and stand bravely for the children and against the pressures of political correctness and the spiteful accusations of bigotry. But as Thursday’s failed legislation in South Dakota makes clear, time is running out.

How Trump’s UN Social Policies Strengthen Foreign Relations,"According to recent news reports, the Trump administration has instructed U.S. delegates to the United Nations to replace the term “sexual reproductive health” with those like “reproduction and the related health services” and the word “gender” with “woman” in documents and negotiations. These reports (and a resulting letter from members of Congress) stem from “leaked” State Department memos and warn that striking these terms will damage U.S.-foreign relations, hinder access to health care, oppress women’s rights, and “define transgender people out of existence.” These reports are at best misinformed about U.S. development aid and foreign relations and at worst sounding yet another false alarm to continue Obama’s legacy of “progressive” social ideology in U.S. foreign policy.

President Obama’s administration took a hardline approach in promoting legalized abortion, LGBT ideology, and fluid and multiple “gender identities” around the world through the UN, State Department, and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Yet promoting western social values has very little to do with improving U.S.-foreign relations or reaching development goals.

Instead, this is the newest form of colonialism imposed upon vulnerable countries under the guise of foreign aid. It disrespects national sovereignty and individual freedoms of religion and belief. The result: to erode public goodwill toward the United States and endanger U.S. relations with the majority of socially conservative and religious countries of Africa, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East—as well as populations in Latin America and Eastern and Southern Europe.

Several U.S. nongovernmental organizations working closely with member states at the UN report that foreign delegates often feel coerced to accept western social values during negotiations in order to receive funds. Pope Francis’s 2015 address to the UN General Assembly reminds states that even well-intentioned foreign aid risks becoming “cover for all kinds of abuse and corruption, or for carrying out an ideological colonization by the imposition of anomalous models and lifestyles which are alien to people’s identity and, in the end, irresponsible.”

Abortion Is Not Women’s Top Health Need

The term “sexual and reproductive health” has been used at the UN to refer to the inclusion of abortion services since negotiations in the Cairo 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD). In the conference’s resulting Programme of Action, these and similar terms are clearly defined to include abortion (13.14 and 7.6).

However, contrary to assertions of abortion advocates, legalized abortion is not an international right but under the sovereignty of UN member states. The Programme of Action says any changes related to abortion are determined “at the national or local level according to the national legislative process” (8.25) and even adds that “governments should take the appropriate steps to help women avoid abortion, which in no case should be promoted as a method of family planning.” (8.25 and 7.24)

If U.S. delegates push “sexual reproductive health,” it ultimately undermines the national sovereignty of member states and the U.S. position on funding abortion overseas—i.e. the Helms Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and President Trump’s executive action reinstating and extending the Mexico City Policy through Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance.

Meanwhile, western-based organizations spend billions to push “comprehensive” reproductive services (emphasis “abortion”) on the premise that these promote women’s rights, health, education, and economic prosperity. In developing countries, these organizations widely promote legalized abortion as an integral part of maternal health and decreasing maternal mortality.

But according to the UN and World Health Organization, of the 289,000 women who died in pregnancy or child birth in 2013, only 8 percent died from unsafe abortion. The other 92 percent died from direct and indirect causes like hemorrhaging (leading cause), sepsis, hypertensive disorder, HIV, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease. Why, then, is abortion promoted in a much greater capacity than services that could actually combat the majority of deaths—like skilled birth attendants, antibiotics, blood banking, and uterotonics?

The bottom line is that “vast resources” of global organizations fail to focus on the real causes of maternal mortality—causes the West has effectively treated for almost 100 years. The tragedy, according to two Africa-based maternal health doctors, is that “In the middle of the night, a woman bleeding to death from a post-partum hemorrhage cannot be saved by…a reproductive health mandate.”

Foreign Countries Resent U.S. Abortion-Pushing

In addition, the concept of abortion isn’t accepted within the cultures of most countries. Pew Research Center shows that in 26 out of 40 countries surveyed, the majority of populations believe abortion is “morally unacceptable.” Most of these countries lie in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and the Muslim-majority countries of Asia and the Middle East. In Africa, all countries surveyed believe abortion is morally wrong by the vast majority of their populations.

A voice for African women, Nigerian-born Obianuju Ekeocha, echoes Pope Francis’s statements, calling the push of abortion by western organizations “Ideological Neocolonialism.” At a UN panel she remarked: “At the core of my people’s value system is the profound recognition that human life is precious, paramount and supreme.”

She explained that in traditional African languages, phrasing abortion in a good light is impossible and colonialization occurs when westerners introduce language and concepts that redefine African culture. She drove the point home: “to convince … any woman in Africa that abortion is … a good thing, you first of all have to tell her that what her parents and her grandparents and her ancestors taught her is actually wrong … and that…is colonialization.”

Gender Identity and U.S. Foreign Policy

In addition, clarifying the word “gender” to refocus “gender empowerment and equality” on women’s needs and inequalities is sorely needed in U.S. domestic law and foreign policy. For decades, these terms have referred to empowering women and decreasing the many historically and statistically documented inequalities between men and women. But since Obama’s administration, the term “gender” has more often been used to promote social acceptance of homosexuality and transgenderism domestically and internationally.

If one doubts the extremity of Obama-era “gender” programming, one example of many is USAID’s Health Policy Plus (HP+) and its Gender and Sexual Diversity training module. It promotes the concept that an individual’s gender identity, defined as “one’s internal or inside experience of gender (or) how one wishes to define their own gender,” doesn’t always correspond with their biological sex (12.2.3).

It also teaches “biological sex, gender expression, gender identity and sexual orientation all exist on separate continuums,” and is cautious to explain that “attempting to guess where someone is on one continuum based on where they exist on another is not only often wrong, it can be insulting” (12.2.5). Question: even if Americans agreed on this concept (and they do not), what does this have to do with U.S.-taxpayer funded foreign development and aid?

Let’s Help Women by Ignoring Them

Obama’s foreign policy actually turned funds allocated for “gender empowerment” away from supporting women and girls around the world. How terribly unfortunate, considering that initiatives to protect women and girls and advance their participation and rights are severely lacking in funding.

Most countries don’t consider LGBT people a distinct class in need of special protections beyond those of other citizens.

Consider that of the millions of victims of global human trafficking each year, 52 percent are women and 22 percent are girls under the age of 18 used for sexual exploitation and forced labor. Also consider that 40 percent of girls in the least developed countries are married before age 18, and 12 percent before age 15. These are only two critical areas where gender foreign aid should focus.

Even with Obama’s foreign-policy push, LGBT activists failed to get “sexual orientation and gender identity” (SOGI) terms into any binding treaty at the UN. The terms are “mentioned in only a few non-binding resolutions … suggestions governments are free to ignore.”

Neither does international law recognize SOGI terms, in large part due to non-consensus among UN member states on their use. Furthermore, most countries don’t consider LGBT people a distinct class in need of special protections beyond those of other citizens.

The citizens of these countries don’t agree, either. Pew research shows that in most of 40 countries surveyed, half or more of their populations believe homosexuality is “morally unacceptable.” In seven countries, 90 percent or more of the population holds this view.

Another survey found “widespread rejection in predominantly Muslim nations and in Africa, as well as in parts of Asia and Russia” mainly in religious countries. Surely, based on these facts U.S. foreign policy and aid should be more sensitive to the traditional beliefs and cultures of other countries.

Public Diplomacy and Foreign Policy

In 2003, an independent task force was sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations to develop a strategy to respond to an alarming rise in anti-Americanism. The task force concluded that Washington faces challenges overseas that can’t just be won with military force, but with “willing” foreign partners created by “a strong and robust public policy—one able to win hearts and minds and show people that the United States can once again be trusted and admired.” And, to be effective, public diplomacy must help “explain how U.S. policies fit the values and interests of other nations.”

The Trump administration’s instruction to strike references to “sexual reproductive health” and clearly define “gender” terms at the UN makes sense for U.S. foreign policy. It is one small step towards considering how U.S. policies fit the “values and interests of other nations,” respect national sovereignty, and focus on the real objectives of foreign aid and relations. This step will go a long way in improving U.S. public diplomacy and foreign relations around the world.

Leftists To WI Judge: You Can't Be A Good Judge If You're A Christian,"With six weeks left until election day in Wisconsin’s Supreme Court race, several far-left organizations are using media outlets to amplify a smear campaign against a judge based on his Christianity. Brian Hagedorn, a current Wisconsin Court of Appeals judge and former Scott Walker legal counsel, is being publicly trashed for being on the board of a small Christian school, and for blog posts when he was in law school discussing court cases about abortion and gay sex.

In considering a run for the state Supreme Court, the father of five children says, “I expected to be attacked here because that’s what’s happening all across the country–you know, ‘Are you now or have you ever been associated with the Knights of Columbus?'” he said, chuckling. “Interrogating people [nominated for office] if they went to a Bible study or the Knights of Columbus, that’s where we are as a country.”

The media characterization of his writing is often misleading. For example, a ThinkProgress hit piece claims that, in a blog post paraphrasing former Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia’s dissent on a case about Texas sodomy laws, Hagedorn “compared homosexuality to bestiality.” In fact, his post simply notes the U.S. Constitution has nothing to say about any supposed rights to sex with anyone or anything, then essentially paraphrases Scalia’s dissent, which two other justices joined.

That dissent said striking a law against sodomy on the grounds that states are constitutionally forbidden from banning any sexual activity citizens consider “immoral and unacceptable” also eliminates the legal basis for “criminal laws against fornication, bigamy, adultery, adult incest, bestiality, and obscenity.” Scalia instead invited LGBT activists to persuade their fellow citizens that sodomy bans were wrong and change the laws, rather than using courts to eliminate the legal basis on which states criminalize socially disapproved sexual behaviors.

While a law student in 2005, Hagedorn simply wrote he agreed with this legal analysis. It doesn’t compare bestiality and homosexuality in anything except the basis for former laws against them. That both were illegal on this basis until relatively recently is simply a fact. Yet like ThinkProgress, several Wisconsin outlets quoted context-free snippets of Hagedorn’s post in a rush to paint him as a bigot.

“The news reports have been entirely misleading on that,” Hagedorn said in a phone interview. “They often can’t track the legal arguments… The argument I was making was nothing other than what three Supreme Court justices made in that very case. The Lawrence v. Texas decision’s logic was not strong. I am not myself interested in relitigating all those issues today, but that argument that was made was just tracking that Supreme Court case.”

The attacks on Hagedorn also target a small Christian school that he and his wife helped found. Associated Press, Wisconsin State Journal, and Wisconsin Public Radio headlines falsely said the school “bans LGBT teachers, students,” “bar[s] gays” and “bans homosexuals.” No, the school’s conduct code forbids “students, parents and teachers from ‘participating in immoral sexual activity (defined as any form of touching or nudity for the purpose of evoking sexual arousal apart from the context of marriage between one man and one woman).'”

That’s only a gay ban if you offensively assume gay people can’t resist having sex. Remember, students are minors whom many think shouldn’t engage in sex at all regardless of what kind. Under this policy gay students could be welcomed. Therefore, it’s not a “gay ban.”

Further, if it is a gay ban then it’s also a cohabiting and makeout ban, but people who cohabit and make out aren’t (yet) identity groups that can be weaponized to amass political power, so no news story makes that connection. So do Christians also hate cohabitors and people who hook up and make out and twerk, or does Christianity hold extremely high standards for sexual behavior that are not at all limited to homosexuality? We can’t consider the latter, apparently, because that contradicts the politically useful narrative that people of faith bear some particular ill will towards homosexuals.

In a press release and to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, however, the activist group One Wisconsin Now pushed that divisive and religiously bigoted narrative, calling the 40-student school “an organization that actively discriminates against the LGBTQ community” because its conduct codes say Christians must reserve sex for natural marriage. This is a core Christian teaching and has been for 2,000 years. If any organization that holds this view “actively discriminates against the LGBTQ community,” then all orthodox Christian, Islamic, and Jewish organizations, as well as many Bhuddist and Hindu organizations, are centers of bigotry. Good luck convincing the majority of the world’s cultures and religions that they are evil bigots for upholding thousands of years of cross-cultural and cross-religious teachings.

The argument against Hagedorn seems to be that no faithful religious believer can also be a good public official, in line with a crop of similar attacks on federal nominees at the federal level from prominent Democrats including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Sen. Cory Booker, Sen. Kamala Harris, Sen. Mazie Hirono, and Sen. Bernie Sanders. How convenient for the minority of secularists to define their tribe as the only one eligible for rule. And whatever happened to tolerance and pluralism, and not discriminating against people based on their identity?

“My job as a judge is to say what the law is and not what it should be,” Hagedorn said. “This is an effort to attack me for my faith and take this [campaign] in directions that are irrelevant to the job that I’m doing of applying the law faithfully.”

Not only are these kinds of attacks against people of faith the real bigotry at play, they are massively ignorant, in bad faith, and unconstitutional: “no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States,” says the U.S. Constitution’s article six.

Hagedorn says his conservative judicial philosophy restrains him from doing anything other than applying the laws equally and impartially, regardless of his personal religious or political beliefs. In fact, he said, “Any judge who does not regularly issue a decision he does not agree with is not a good judge. My job is not to decide whether I like the law or policy or not. We need to stop politicizing our courts and stop incorporating one’s own views into judicial decisionmaking.”

The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel even contacted the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights to ask about the school, and raised the prospect of “lawsuits alleging discrimination against the school’s officials or Hagedorn.” Nice little school you made for your kids there. Be a shame if the federal government investigated it or somebody filed a discrimination lawsuit. Thankfully, Hagedorn says, private religious schools have the well-established legal right to hire and fire based on their religious beliefs.

“All I can do is treat people with dignity and respect and gentleness,” Hagedorn said, when asked how these attacks are affecting him personally. “I’ve always tried to do that. I think there’s likely to be people who do continue to be excluded for some period of time [for their religion]. If I’m one of them, so be it. But I’m going to try to be faithful to the calling I have… Maybe I can be one small stone in the river that says this is not okay. I am going to be a judge who applies the law fairly to everybody regardless of my Christian faith. We need to move past this as a culture and a country.”

These smears against Hagedorn and others like him nominated or running for public office hang a “No Christians need apply” sign on not only public offices but entire professions, such as law, health, and education. In all of these domains, and more, Christians are increasingly told to check their convictions at the door.

This kind of political pressure also implies that, in an America rapidly embedding LGBT legal and cultural preferences, religious integrity is increasingly at odds with the political regime. Christians — and Jews and Buddhists and other faithful believers — have lived in those kinds of hostile societies before.

“The great thing about being a Christian is that my hope is not in this life,” Hagedorn said. “All I can do is be faithful to what I’ve been called to and let the chips fall where they may.”",https://thefederalist.com/2019/02/18/leftists-wi-supreme-court-candidate-cant-good-judge-youre-christian/,2019-02-18
Study Claiming Prejudice Makes LGBT People Die Younger Is Retracted,"In 2014, a team led by Columbia University Associate Professor Mark Hatzenbuehler published a groundbreaking study claiming to show that “structural stigma,” which the authors define as “communities with high levels of anti-gay prejudice,” increases the likelihood of a premature death among LGBT people. The study has now been retracted.

The researchers claimed that sexual minorities living in communities with high levels of prejudice, on average, live 12 years shorter than those living in accepting communities. The study, “Structural stigma and all-cause mortality in sexual minority populations” was re-analyzed by the original authors after renowned sociologist from the University of Texas at Austin, Mark Regnerus, published an article in the same academic journal showing that the study’s main findings failed to replicate after using ten different approaches. Regnerus’s findings proved right, and the journal Social Science & Medicine retracted the original paper.

The study showing sexual minorities living in highly prejudiced communities are more likely than others to die younger was important because this was all the evidence some needed to insist we all restructure society by reconsidering sexual identity, sexual orientation, and religious liberty. In other words, if a root cause can be found for why sexual minorities are prone to shorter lifespans, then it must be addressed urgently through sweeping legislation or other means. The faulty results Hatzenbuehler and his team produced in their research provided additional grounds for progressives to attack and undermine religious liberty.

How the Study Went Wrong

To carry out the study, Hatzenbuehler and his team relied on data from the General Social Survey (GSS) and the National Death Index (NDI). The GSS studies American culture and provides information on social attitudes and the NDI stores death records.

To evaluate prejudicial attitudes towards sexual minorities, the researchers reviewed the answers to the following questions: 1) “If some people in your community suggested that a book in favor of homosexuality should be taken out of your public library, would you favor removing this book, or not?” 2) “Should a man who admits that he is a homosexual be allowed to teach in a college or university, or not?” 3) Suppose a man who admits that he is a homosexual wanted to make a speech in your community. Should he be allowed to speak, or not?” 4) “Do you think that sexual relations between two adults of the same sex is always wrong, almost always wrong, wrong only sometimes, or not wrong at all?”

The researchers considered these questions “anti-gay prejudice questions” and evaluated the data gathered by the GSS and the NDI, which resulted in their key finding of a significant link between high levels of prejudice and having a shorter life expectancy.

Yet when Regnerus published findings that failed to reinforce LGBT activists’ claims, some people proceeded to attack his character and beliefs. In July 2012, Regnerus published a study showing that there are notable differences in outcomes between children raised by parents in a same-sex relationship and children raised by intact biological families. His study directly challenged the American Psychological Association’s declaration that: “Not a single study has found children of lesbian or homosexual parents to be disadvantaged in any significant respect relation to children of heterosexual parents.”

As a result of his research, Regnerus experienced unrelenting vilification. The academic establishment even questioned the peer-review process of the publisher. A few months later, however, the University of Texas at Austin cleared Regnerus from all the allegations.

The Strange Lack Of Coverage

Naomi Schaefer Riley, writing an opinion article for the New York Post, rightfully observed that after Hatzenbuehler and his co-authors published their study showing a link exists between anti-gay prejudice and reduced life expectancy, news coverage about it was rampant, but when Regnerus published his results directly challenging the paper’s key findings, the media did not do its due diligence in covering it.

Of course, one might expect that the mainstream media is all for the pursuit of truth and factual coverage of important news, but apparently this is not always the case. Perhaps some facts don’t fit their desired agenda, or maybe they are afraid of giving a platform to so-called “dangerous” ideas.

Although it appears Hatzenbuehler and his co-authors did not intentionally commit the error which after correction did not show the link between anti-gay prejudice and premature death to be “statistically significant”(as has been the case with other studies in recent times) it nevertheless highlights a cold truth in contemporary American culture: mainstream media only covers what it wants and what it wants the public to see.

A key takeaway from this is that it’s all too easy to accept conclusions that advance political causes. We can make that mistake as consumers of media, too. Check the evidence before you buy a conclusion.

United Methodists Dodged A Kill Shot By Affirming God’s Design For Sex,"At the end of February, the United Methodist Church bravely dodged what would have been a self-inflicted kill shot. Pushed to definitive action by gay activists within their ranks, they not only refused to mutilate clear biblical teaching on same-sex couples and gay clergy, the UMC voted to strengthen its adherence to biblical sexual ethics.

We must appreciate just how against-the-tide this move is for a mainline denomination, and they should be roundly celebrated for their bold fidelity. But here’s the spin.

Many media stories are going with the “United Methodist Church Positions Itself for a Massive Split” angle because of the “hard-liners” inflexibility—as if all would have been hunky-dory if the denomination acquiesced to LGBT demands. The media is getting this one all wrong. (Why stop now, right?) The UMC did nothing short of averting its own death.

They did so at this year’s General Conference in St. Louis by choosing to adopt what was called the Traditional Plan over the manipulatively named One Church Plan. (Oh, you’re not for one church?) The latter was hawked as the best for everyone because it would not compel anyone to go all-in for gay ideology. But those who wanted to could. What could go wrong, right?

Thankfully, the majority of delegates didn’t fall for this Kumbaya ploy. If anything has been made clear over the last few years, it’s that gay politics do not “coexist.” Instead, the UMC tightened things up to make sure this chicanery would no longer be an issue for them.

Yes, God Wholeheartedly Loves Gay People

The adopted Traditional Plan strongly asserts the value of all people without exclusion, each being “of sacred worth, created in the image of God.” It proclaims that “All persons need the ministry of the Church” and affirms that “God’s grace is available to all.”

Those of us in the traditional camp know this is not mere happy talk to just make people feel better. It is basic Christianity. But just as basic, the plan also affirms a traditional sexual and marital ethic in line with what the Methodist church, and Christianity itself, has always held without doubt or contest.

Better yet, it gives real teeth to the matter, requiring every bishop to submit an official and public statement declaring whether they can or cannot fully uphold and enforce the church’s biblical standards around marriage and the ordination of clergy. This will halt the shenanigans LGBT agitators have been playing within the church to move their ball inch-by-inch down the field. If these leaders cannot affirm church teaching, a protocol is established for them and their congregations to go somewhere else so they can create some other faith from their own wishes.

Church Split or Church Reinvigoration?

So what about a split? Yes, some of the theological and ecclesiological innovators will take their rainbow flags and go home crying bigotry. One person’s split is another’s purge. That’s the risk of mounting a revolution, which the gay lobby certainly has done. Just don’t blame the ones defending themselves against the revolutionaries as the instigators of a split. That’s rich.

It is clear that the leadership of the United Methodist Church has been paying close attention to what happened to the Episcopal/Anglican Church as they gave gay ideology a long, full-body hug. Ever since, the Anglican faithful have been running for the doors as if the buildings are on fire, which highlights a great irony. Put up a rainbow “We Welcome All” banner across the doors of your church, and folks start going elsewhere.

It’s not just the old blue-hairs who are leaving in a huff. Research conducted jointly at Columbia University and the University of California at Los Angeles examined the church choices of same-sex-attracted men and women. The findings floored the pro-gay authors of the study, as such individuals were 2.5 times more likely to attend churches that took a more conservative view on homosexuality—churches that these scholars derisively called “non-affirming”—over the rainbow flag-waving ones.

The folks at Pew found largely the same. Thus, the UMC under the Traditional Plan is more likely to actually attract those needing to hear the clear teaching of God’s Word and see it practiced. Research shows this is not by coincidence.

Churches That Stand Firm Grow

Some Canadian sociologists of religion wanted to see which mainline churches have been declining and which are growing. The strength and clarity in their findings wrote the study’s title: “Theology Matters.”

These scholars found that, while most mainline congregations have long been hemorrhaging members by the millions, a few have actually been growing. The primary difference? Theological conservatism. People are voting with their feet, hoofing it to the mainline churches that still teach, preach, and practice historic Christianity.

Another fact the UMC leadership clearly learned from the Anglican debacle was that their faith is not just a white phenomenon of the Northern Hemisphere. Both churches, along with most all other Christian traditions, are exploding (not literally, but almost!) in the global south, particularly on the African continent.

The wing of the Anglican Church led by these brave, resolute African bishops now outnumbers those identified with England. They have more churches, larger and more lively ones, and more seminaries. The power base of the Anglican Church has undeniably shifted to Nigeria, that tradition’s most dominant body.

These African bishops are having tremendous success here in the United States, also, as more U.S. Anglicans align themselves under their faithful oversight and care. The Guardian could not help noting in 2016 that the African bishops who left the Church of England were not so much “leaving the Anglican Communion, but walking out of its funeral.” The UMC leadership noted it also.

Will the Real Colonialist Please Stand Up?

For all the talk coming from the left about the evils of Western colonialism, they are zealots enforcing their sexual colonialism upon the developing world, with a dose of racism. At a meeting of liberal clergy in San Francisco some years ago, it was pointed out by one conferee that it was “those African bishops” who were the primary obstacle to accomplishing their agenda and that they needed to be dealt with.

At another gathering in New York City on the topic of blessing gay sex in the Anglican Church, a deeply frustrated white, gay Episcopalian announced in his session that the African bishops must stop “monkeying around” with the rest of the church. He also said these words: “All I have to say to these bishops is: Go back to the jungle where you came from.”

This paternalism continues full-bore today. Just before the UMC vote in St. Louis last week, Dr. Jerry P. Kulah, dean of the Gbarnga School of Theology at the United Methodist University in Liberia, spoke these powerful words to his fellow church leaders:

Friends, please hear me, we Africans are not afraid of our sisters and brothers who identify as lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, transgendered, questioning, or queer. … But we know of no compelling arguments for forsaking our church’s understanding of Scripture and the teachings of the church universal. [W]e Africans are not children in need of western enlightenment when it comes to the church’s sexual ethics. We do not need to hear a progressive U.S. bishop lecture us about our need to ‘grow up.’

No they do not, and neither does the rest of the body of Christ throughout the world. As the gay lobby works overtime to construct a whole other gospel, they should have the integrity to admit their project is at great odds with mere Christianity and go join the Unitarians. There’s all kinds of room over there.

Methodists Who Support Gay Clergy And Weddings Aren’t Woke Activists,"I attend the largest United Methodist Church in the nation, the Church of the Resurrection in Leawood, Kansas. On March 3, Senior Pastor Adam Hamilton returned from the United Methodists’ General Conference in St. Louis, Missouri to report the results to the congregation. Hamilton advocated a policy allowing local discretion for pastors to officiate gay marriages and to allow local conferences to ordain gay clergy.

Hamilton has described to us how his personal beliefs evolved from opposing same-sex marriage and gay clergy to accepting those ideas. In making his case to the congregation, he has pointed to the fact that the church has had to evolve on a number of issues, even as reflected within the Bible itself.

We Don’t Ban Shellfish Any More, After All

For instance, early Christians of Jewish origin believed that new Christians must observe the law of Moses on such matters as circumcision and diet. Deuteronomy 23:12-13 appears to prohibit indoor plumbing. Somehow we have made peace with going to the bathroom with a flush toilet.

Hamilton also pointed out that the congregation includes a large population of single and divorced members who may not strictly observe teachings prohibiting sex outside of marriage. He has also cited how our society has come to reject the practices of polygamy and slavery in spite of the Bible’s apparent tolerance of both.

Hamilton supported something called the “One Church Plan,” which, as he described it to us, would have allowed local counsels to set church doctrine consistent with local laws and customs. So, for example, in the United States where same-sex marriage is recognized by the Supreme Court as a right, local churches could, if they chose, officiate same-sex weddings. In Africa, where homosexuality is often outlawed, local churches would be free to align their practices with local custom and law.

The missionary success of the Methodist Church abroad yielded a substantial voting block of international delegates from new Methodist churches around the world. Delegates from Africa combined with the minority in America to push for a unified church doctrine in which all pastors would be required to comply with the traditionalist approach. This is how the One Church Plan was defeated.

I’ve never been approached by an LGBTQ activist. I’m not sure I would know where to find one if I needed instruction in the meaning of the LGBTQ initials and acceptable pronouns to use to address the appropriate orientations. Thus, I find myself in respectful disagreement with Glenn Stanton in his recent article in The Federalist on the One Church Plan and the vote in the conference.

He appears to believe that the One Church Plan came to us through activists advancing the LGBTQ agenda. I don’t think that’s accurate. I agree with it, not because I’m a woke activist, but because our church and Methodism generally has always been more of a “shall” church, not a “shalt not” church.

Focus on People on the Margins

I’m not gay but I also don’t go to church to listen to pastors tell other people they’re going to hell. I come to church to learn how I can do a better job loving my neighbor and honoring God. Aren’t we all? And anyone who wants to take that first step towards redemption should be allowed to do that.

Hamilton has two degrees in theology and is one of the most widely published theologians in the world. Our church has always shied away from taking hard moral stance on controversial issues. Some may feel that’s not a legitimate approach to the Bible. But Hamilton’s focus has always been to bring the nominally religious and the non-religious to God. From my point of view, there is a conservative case to be made for letting local churches deal with this explosive issue so we can move past this topic and not get bogged down in identity politics.

The Methodist church almost died in America. Hamilton has done something extraordinary in reviving it and leading tens of thousands of people to God who would otherwise not be there. It means fewer suicides, divorces, and drug addicts, and more people praying and reading the Bible.

It’s not that we sit around talking about social and political issues all the time––we don’t. The Methodists don’t, to my knowledge, have an official position on abortion, gun control, the death penalty, the Russia collusion hoax, Medicare for All, or Elizabeth Warren’s Indian ancestry. That’s my point. Those issues can take over and crowd out everything else. It’s not perfect and maybe Hamilton makes it too easy to be a Christian. But it’s better than letting the denomination die off, which is what was happening.

The United Methodist Church has open communion. The doors are open to anyone who wants to start the journey towards salvation. A convicted murderer can still take communion and get married in the church. Sinners who do the most unspeakable things on Saturday nights are welcomed on Sunday morning without reservation.

Ignore the Sin, Love the Sinner

If Hamilton marries two women or two men, that has no effect on my relationship with God. There are churches where the pastors will list the ways sinners will barbecue in the hereafter to the schadenfreude delight of the congregation. That’s not how it works in our church. We learn about the value of service, forgiveness, and holding ourselves accountable to the command to love our neighbors. That means loving our gay neighbors too.

The overwhelming majority of our church in Kansas City probably agrees with Hamilton. I know this because he’s made no secret of his position and those who disagreed left years ago to find different churches.

I’m not a social justice warrior, I don’t trade in identity politics, and I’m not woke. Far from it. One hundred percent of what I come to church to learn has nothing to do with this debate. It seems to me that the One Church Plan allows local churches and individual pastors to deal with this issue in the manner that least disrupts the message of Christ. Now it’s all anyone is talking about.

It’s a shame. I liked it better when church was about Jesus, not politics.

Methodists’ LGBT Controversy Shows Many Don’t Know What Love Means,"If only Jesus had been loving towards his opponents! In his “Seven Woes” sermon directed at the Jewish and religious elite and recorded in the 23rd chapter of Matthew, he calls the scribes and Pharisees “hypocrites,” “children of hell,” “blind guides,” “serpents,” and a “brood of vipers,” who were in danger of “being sentenced to hell.”

Why did he have to say such mean, nasty things? If he had just loved them and accepted them as they were, those scribes and Pharisees would have realized the error of their ways. Didn’t he know that the gospel of Christ is a message of unconditional love and affirmation, not one of judgment and condemnation?

Such a reflection, I hope, is patently ridiculous for Christians. We believe Jesus is the son of God. Being omnipotent and omniscient, he can evaluate men’s hearts and intentions, and dispense judgment, as he pleases.

Yet such a twisted perception of the Christian faith, and particularly what constitutes real Christian love, is visible in recent critics of the United Methodist Church’s recent decision to maintain its doctrines on queer marriage and clergy and strengthen discipline for those who defy church teachings. Lesbian Methodist pastor Hannah Adair Bonner and Methodist layman Adam Mill make the same mistake, conflating Christian love with unconditional acceptance of sin. They also uncharitably vilify their opponents, which is a bit ironic given their call for “love, love, love.”

An Ironic Lack of Charity

Bonner projects herself, and her particular camp within the United Methodist Church, as firmly planted on the side of love. She speak of her overtures to more traditionalist Methodists: “We strove to help them understand our love and to be loving to them, despite the pain they caused us.”

Bonner thinks it’s the LGBTQ-supporting Methodists who truly exemplify the love of Christ. Those who believe LGBTQ behavior to be immoral, sinful, and unbiblical are definitely not being loving. The piece ends with the pastor declaring, in the wake of her defeat, that she will no longer beg people to love her.

Yet for someone trying to embody authentic Christian love, Bonner’s argument is laced with a lack of charity, another word for love. For example, she presumes her traditionalist opponents were unwilling to listen to her side, observing: “the traditionalists revealed themselves to be unaffected. They had come to make their will known, not to listen and be swayed.”

But the only “evidence” Bonner has to substantiate such a claim is that they didn’t accept her arguments! Did Bonner come to the conference to listen to the traditionalists, or to make her own “will known”?

Elsewhere she bemoans that her rainbow stole “elicited eye-rolls from some of the self-described traditionalists.” This can hardly be called persecution. Consider the martyrdom accounts of Christians burned at the stake, or the persecution of my good friend Michael DSouza, a Pakistani Christian who has been repeatedly brutalized by Muslim extremists. Michael would be very happy if all his faith had elicited were some eye-rolls.

Similarly, Mill writes that he doesn’t “go to church to listen to pastors tell other people they’re going to hell.” He claims “there are churches where the pastors will list the ways sinners will barbecue in the hereafter to the schadenfreude delight of the congregation. That’s not how it works in our church.”

I’ve attended a fair number of evangelical, mainline Protestant, and Catholic churches over the years, and I’ve never witnessed a pastor who delighted in talking about Hell. Such religious communities do exist, Westboro Baptist being perhaps the most famous. But Westboro is famous precisely because it’s such an anomaly. Mill’s is an uninformed caricature of the many Christian churches that believe LGBTQ behavior is sinful.

Bonner accuses the traditionalists of “splinter[ing] our church” by refusing to accept LGBTQ behavior as positive. This ignores the fact that pro-LGBTQ theology is a remarkably recent phenomena in the history of all Christian faith traditions, and could just as easily be accused of being the real disruptive force in the church.

A Twisted Understanding of Love

There is a more fundamental misunderstanding of what constitutes true Christian love in both Methodist writers’ thinking. Bonner declares: “We queer clergy begged our fellow Methodists to love us. They voted no.” Mill similarly states that his church is defined by “loving our gay neighbors too.”

Yet those who disapprove of celebrations of sexual sin being foisted upon their Christian institutions are not necessarily being unloving. Apparently in Bonner’s worldview, if one doesn’t explicitly affirm her sexual choices and identity, one is incapable of loving her. This reasoning is reminiscent of the teenager who tells her parents they don’t love her because they won’t condone everything she does.

As noted above, for 2,000 years, there has been a remarkably consistent consensus among Christian traditions that homosexual behavior is immoral. These traditions have taught that to discourage people from engaging in harmful acts isn’t unloving, but a demonstration of real love.

My three kids are constantly doing things they think are great but will ultimately cause them or others great pain, or inhibit their human flourishing. My lack of intervention in the midst of their poor decisions would be a failure of love.

Moreover, as Rod Dreher has noted, do such critics of traditionalists actually think theological conservatives enjoy hurting LGBTQ church members? Of course not. But we take our cue from Christ himself, who, after healing or forgiving sinners expressly tells them “sin no more” (c.f. John 5:14, 8:11).

Painting her opponents as persecutors and herself and her allies as martyrs, Bonner adds: “We strove to help them [the traditionalists] understand our love and to be loving to them, despite the pain they caused us.” Yet how many of these traditionalist Methodists would explicitly say they possess no love for Bonner?

Having known many great traditionalist Methodists over the years, I speculate very few, if any. I think they’d be more likely to emphatically declare that they love her, and would aspire to love her as Christ loved them. Many people who either identity as gay or lesbian (e.g., Eve Tushnet, Wesley Hill), or who were transgender (Walt Heyer) have been able to accept that Christ’s love for them is not a blank check to disregard God’s commands.

Bad Arguments Begat More Bad Arguments

Let me turn now more directly to Mill’s arguments. He says “Methodism generally has always been more of a ‘should’ church, not a ‘shalt not’ church.” Yet the Bible is filled not with polite suggestions, but commandments, including explicit ones about right sexual behavior.

Moreover, this thinking is undermined by the reality that even the most tolerant organizations still draw plenty of firm lines, including the dictum that one “shalt not” be intolerant! Presumably Mill wouldn’t want to be affiliated with a Methodist church that only politely suggests that its members not lie, cheat, steal, and murder.

Jesus never abrogated the Ten Commandments—indeed, if anything, he expanded their scope during the Sermon on the Mount.

Mill then argues that because his congregation includes many people having sex outside marriage, and because it rejects polygamy and slavery, this justifies church approbation of LGBTQ behavior. Yet this thinking is morality via majority opinion. This is foolish and dangerous.

It implies that slavery would be acceptable in a society where a majority of people approved of it, or that a majority consensus could determine to eliminate the mentally ill. Sexual immorality, polygamy, and slavery are wrong because they are objectively immoral, and one will be hard pressed to find anywhere in Scripture that encourages any of them.

Indeed, the Bible consistently shows that polygamy caused all manner of problems for those who practiced it. Scripture also shows that the Jews possessed the most just legal system of any that existed in the ancient world, including a demand for the periodic freeing of slaves.

Mill also makes a commonly heard claim that the church has evolved over time, and that accepting LGBTQ behavior is just the latest evolution. Yet the examples he gives (circumcision, diet, etc.) are all in relation to the ceremonial or civic law of the covenant people (Jews), not the moral law, which governs such things as sexual behavior. Jesus never abrogated the Ten Commandments—indeed, if anything, he expanded their scope during the Sermon on the Mount.

Mill ends by stating that he liked church better when it “was about Jesus and not politics.” But sexual morality is not first a political issue, but a personal and societal one. Indeed, Mill should consider St. Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians, in which the apostle rebukes the Corinthian church for immorality, including fornication (sex outside natural marriage) and incest.

True Love Can Be Tough Love

Bonner writes of “people who told us to our faces that we were unfaithful to the scriptures and a danger to the church — people who denied that we were worthy to preach in the pulpit or be wed at the altar.” The paradox for Bonner, Mill, and apparently for many who hold similar views about sex, is how so many Christians can say such things, while maintaining their love for those same persons.

Fortunately, Jesus offers us an example of exactly how this can be done, every time the gospels relate to us a story of him rebuking someone for their sins, unbelief, or immorality. As biting as his condemnations of the scribes and Pharisees could be, he never stopped loving them. That gives this sinner, who also needs to be rebuked plenty of times, the confidence that tough love is still true love.

"Christians, Stop Assuming LGBT Sin Matters More Than God's Mercy","A recent article for The Federalist argues that woke politics is not necessarily the motivating factor for those United Methodists who supported the plan that would have allowed congregations to choose their spot on the LGBT Inclusivity Index, be it “St. Legion of Many Genders” on the progressive end, “actually believes the Bible” on the traditionalist side, or somewhere in between.

“From my point of view,” Adam Mill states, “there is a conservative case to be made for letting local churches deal with this explosive issue so we can move past this topic and not get bogged down in identity politics.”

A Naive Assessment

With regard to the UMC’s ordained leadership, Mill’s assessment is a bit naïve. As liberal clergy in numerous church bodies have shown throughout the years, the sequel to “make room for progressives” is always “submit to progressives ” as soon as progressives have 51 percent of the votes. Likewise, if you’re not convinced that identity politics reigns supreme in many mainline seminaries and congregations, you’re not paying attention.

With regard to the perception of Methodist laity, however, Mill is not terribly off target. It is entirely possible that, for the average UMC pew sitter, “Don’t make LGBT people feel bad about themselves” is not a sentiment born from progressive politics masquerading as theology. Rather, it’s a statement that is perfectly consistent with the core creed of good old-fashioned American Christianity: “When Papa God is being too strict, have Mama Church talk some sense into him.”

For the average American who is somewhere on the church-going spectrum, his understanding of Christianity is something like this: God has promised to be our father, and we have promised to be his children. But the caveat of this covenant is that both parties must behave reasonably for it to remain unbroken. God will give us his kingdom if we are reasonably obedient to him, and we will give him our obedience if the things he commands seem reasonable.

The church’s job in all of this is to ensure that both parties keep their respective ends of the bargain. If ever Papa God gets too strict, or if ever we get too rebellious, Mama Church is there to talk sense into the offending party.

Christian Morality’s Influence On Culture

Throughout most of our history, American culture has been highly influenced by Christian morality. On account of this, societal judgments against sexual immorality kept things like divorce and licentiousness out of the public eye, which caused most Christians to conclude that those living in opposition to the Bible’s teachings on these issues were the unreasonable ones who needed to hear Mama Church say, “Your father isn’t asking for too much when he tells you not to have sex before marriage or keep our wedding vows. So ask Jesus to grant you the forgiveness necessary to start over in your quest to lead a holy life.”

However, as our culture has grown more secular, certain forms of immorality have become more common in the public eye, which has made societal judgments against them wane, which has dulled our consciences to the guilt those sins bring, which makes those sins far more tempting, which makes us more likely to commit them, which makes it more difficult to imagine living without them, which makes God seem like the unreasonable one when he calls us away from those sins.

When this happens, we then expect Mama Church to rebuke Papa God for his unreasonable devotion to his unchanging word, telling him, “I know you’ve always said these things were wrong, but everybody does them now. So cut the kid some slack.”

Likewise, when God’s children have run away from their overly rigid father into the land of unbelief, we also expect Mama Church to invite them back, saying, “Don’t worry. I talked to your father. He’s not going to ask you to give up something that’s so important to you.”

Parish pastors encounter this kind of thinking all the time. Frequently we have to tell members things like, “No, I won’t confirm your child who is never in church or catechism class because you have him worshiping at the altar of youth sports instead” or “You and your fiancée are living together, so no, I won’t officiate your wedding.”

While some respond with repentance and a desire to live according to God’s word, more often than not, people respond with “Everybody does this nowadays. It’s not that big of deal. So why are you being so strict? Why are you driving people away from God instead of being more accepting?”

In other words, “The church exists to make it as easy as possible to be a Christian. So get out of the way and let Mama Church do her job by telling us that she talked some sense into Papa God and now we don’t have to choose between our souls and our idols anymore.”

The Vicious Cycle of Double Standards on Sexual Morality

Mill’s article also demonstrates this mindset when he discusses his pastor’s justification for blessing gay marriages. Mill states that his pastor “pointed out that the congregation includes a large population of single and divorced members who may not strictly observe teachings prohibiting sex outside of marriage.” In other words, “Mama Church convinced straight people that they could still be Christians and continue pursuing the illicit sexual encounters that appealed to them, so why can’t we do the same for gay people?”

Here we see the failure of American Christianity. In order to make God’s law seem more reasonable, congregations refrain from condemning the sins embraced by the secular culture, which gives the secular culture more influence over us, which makes whichever bits of God’s word that seemed reasonable a few minutes ago now seem unreasonable, which makes congregations refrain from condemning the next batch of sins we’ve made an indispensable part of our life. And so on and so forth.

Those who wouldn’t speak against Sin A yesterday won’t speak against Sin AA today, and they won’t speak against Sin AAA tomorrow. A few more spins of this vicious cycle and devotees of nicer-than-God American Christianity will be insisting that the best way to get Jason Voorhees back in church is to let him swing his machete as he approaches the communion rail.

What Really Should Be Happening Here

How, then, do we break this vicious cycle? How do we convince the prodigal sons that they, not God, are the ones at fault? The answer is simple—we ditch American Christianity in favor of the orthodox version.

The union between God and his children is not, as so many believe, a covenant built on mutual promises of reasonableness. It’s not a covenant where we promise to make ourselves holy by obeying God’s commands and he promises to make the highway to heaven relatively easy. Rather, it’s a covenant of grace—one where God the Son earns eternal life for us sinners who could not earn it and where God the Father gives that salvation as a free gift to all who believe.

In this covenant, the church’s role is not to keep both sides acting reasonably, but, through the power of God the Spirit, to keep both sides united by delivering this free gift through the word and sacraments that create faith in Christ our savior. But in order to believe that Christ is your savior, you have to believe that he has saved you from something, which is something sinners will never understand if Mama Church keeps telling Papa God to have a Snickers every time he’s acting a little too Old-Testamenty.

The Severity of God’s Law

If we want to bring the lost, the wounded, and the marginalized into the kingdom of God, therefore, the best thing we can do for them is make the severity of God’s law perfectly clear to them, to tell them, “As He demonstrated in the days of Noah and Abraham, God does not lose even 1 percent of his wrath even if 99 percent of us have lost interest in avoiding his wrath. No matter how unreasonable you find his jots and tittles, quite simply, if you want eternal life, God does not require you to be approximately as righteous as the average person around you. He doesn’t even require you to be as righteous as the holiest person around you. He requires you to be as righteous as he is.”

“But all of us have failed to do this. All of us have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. All of us deserve nothing from God but condemnation. Yet out of his undying love, God sent his only begotten son to die for us. Out of his love for sinners, God sent him who knew no sin to be sin for us, to bear our sins, and declare that his worthiness is now ours, and that we are now worthy of eternal life because of this.”

In Matthew 13, Jesus tells us that the kingdom of heaven “is like a merchant in search of fine pearls who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it.” There is some debate among theologians as to the meaning of these words. Some say that Christ is the merchant who gives up all he has, meaning his life, to make us sinners his own. Other say it’s the other way around—we are the ones who should give up everything in order to make Christ and his salvation our possession.

As 1 John 4 shows us, however, this needn’t be an either/or interpretation: “We love because He first loved us.” Christ suffered everything to forgive us. The more we understand this, the more we will gladly suffer anything to keep his forgiveness. But the less we understand his sacrifice, the less willing we are to sacrifice any earthly pleasure or peace for his sake.

In a recent article for the Washington Post, self-described “queer clergywoman” Hannah Adair Bonner tells the story of a young gay man who addressed those in attendance at the recent UMC General Conference. “We have brought people to Jesus,” he said, “because they say they have not heard this message before. They didn’t know God could love them because their churches said God didn’t.”

Despite this appeal, traditionalists could not be convinced to support the proposed One Church Plan––something Bonner sees as a sign of the church’s failure. In a way, she is right about this, albeit for the wrong reason. The problem is not that Mama Church has failed to convince Papa God to make room for gay Christians. It’s that Mama Church has failed to convince sinners of every sexual orientation that eternal life with their father in heaven is more valuable than the occasional moment of masturbatory pleasure on earth.

Christ has invited every sinner in this world to receive forgiveness, life, and salvation from his church. When sinners can’t possibly imagine that freedom in Christ is better than slavery to Eros, you can’t help them by being nicer than God. You can only help them by asking them to look at their chains long enough to know what it means when Jesus melts them with his mercy.

How Obergefell Taught Me Marriage Is Far More Than A Piece Of Paper,"It’s been a year since I found myself standing in unexpectedly freezing weather, Jacob shaking next to me—not from butterflies, but from the sharp wind. I held him a little closer to keep him warm.

It was our wedding day, and nothing had gone according to plan. My family shivered as the minister shouted above the wind and the buses passing next to the public library across from the courthouse. It was chaotic and absurd, but looking into the eyes of Jacob and seeing as much anticipation and calm confidence as I felt, it all seemed perfect.

It was the celebration of everyone in my life that really became a shining memory of that precious moment. From my friends at home to my coworkers shocked and playfully indignant I had not invited them, to the dozens and dozens of happy greetings from people I interact with nearly every day online, the public celebration of our moment was breathtaking. It is staggering to experience love and I was, simply and gratefully, overwhelmed.

Soon life with Jacob became a beautifully simple series of mundane activities and cozy lounging with our cats while watching TV. Each Sunday we drove to the pet store, played with the puppies, and enjoyed a local breakfast venue famous in our area. As spring warmed up the yard, we were soon consumed with planting flowers, designing a patio, and planning to bring a puppy into our new family. I found purpose and connection unlike anything I ever knew before. Marriage changed me.

Before the Supreme Court decision Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015, which found states limiting marriage to one man and one woman violated the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, I was fairly conservative on the topic. I did not oppose same-sex marriage, but I was more or less content with letting individual states do as they pleased on the issue. I opposed the federal government either banning this policy or imposing it onto the states.

But once the decision came down and gay couples began getting married across the country, I accepted that sometimes progressives bully their way through and there are simply more important priorities to focus on. For me the fight came down to ensuring those with religious beliefs opposing same-sex relationships were not forced to participate in same-sex weddings. It became important to me that creating a new legal right did not infringe on the rights of others.

Obergefell Didn’t Settle Things for Many Americans

I waved away concerns from LGBT media that GOP control would mean losing the ability to marry. Then I saw two state GOP legislators propose doing exactly that.

Kansas Republicans introduced House Bill 2320, which essentially argues current LGBTQ political action is an aspect of secular humanism, which it reasons is a religion. By requiring the states to recognize same-sex marriage, they argue the federal government is imposing religious standards onto the people of the state, many of whom do not wish their tax dollars to benefit “parody marriages.”

After admitting the bill’s language was “harsh,” bill sponsor and state Rep. Randy Garber said, “Their marriage probably doesn’t affect me — their union or whatever you want to call it. But in my opinion, they’re trying to force their beliefs on society.”

Tennessee also re-introduced the Natural Marriage Defense Act, which would prevent same-sex marriages from being issued or recognized in the state. The purpose of the bill would be to intentionally challenge Obergefell through a series of appeals and, hopefully, take the matter before the Supreme Court for another ruling.

In 2015, the first Natural Marriage Defense Act was opposed by Tennessee’s Republican governor and attorney general. In 2018 the bill, HB0892, failed. The most recent version of the bill, HB1369, has one sponsor, state Rep. Jerry Sexton (R). The latest action on it has been assigning the bill to the Children and Family Subcommittee.

The Kansas bill, HB2320, currently has seven Republican state sponsors and has been referred to the judiciary committee. Although neither bill may go very far, they have validated many fears the LGBT left proposed would become reality if Republicans won the presidency, took the House and Senate, and confirmed conservative Supreme Court justices.

A Battle of Worries and Woes

Certainly, one of the right’s fears prior to Obergefell was that legally recognizing same-sex relationships would usher in ever-growing demands and boundary-pushing. Subsequent happenings such as the public celebration of Desmond Napoles, an 11-year-old drag queen, have alarmed parents and those interested in protecting children from sexual exploitation. There is a strong desire to take back our culture from the left’s excesses and dangerous social experimentation following Obergefell.

But I hope to offer another view. Since embracing my conservative views, I have stood up for Christians and other religious groups defending their traditions and beliefs, and I understand the significance marriage has in the traditional religious worldview. Yet I also wonder if those who view marriage as a good for society also see the good it has offered myself and Jacob.

This is a two-way agreement, as those on the right recognize the current vindictive targeting and harassment of religious business owners and other private services by LGBT advocacy creates resentment and does significant harm. In this we stand with you, as our inclusion in this institution should never restrict others’ religious freedom.

Marriage Is More than a Piece of Paper

Marriage has become more to me than simply a set of legal protections. My husband was able to emigrate here due to the federal recognition of our marriage. While simple things like health insurance and filling out our taxes have a special sense of security associated with them, people also engage with you differently in society after you are married.

Marriage has been a profound experience for me, as the connection to this other person is far deeper than I ever felt while dating.

Marriage has been a profound experience for me, as the connection to this other person is far deeper than I ever felt while dating. A decade of casual sex, loneliness, and believing myself “not marriage material” evaporated shockingly fast, and I found peace and security I had never known before. It is more than sharing my life, sharing a home, and sharing bills. It has allowed us to integrate into normal America and experience equality in its most tangible form. It saved my life in a way that is difficult to fully appreciate.

For me and countless others like me, marriage has accomplished exactly what traditional conservatives argue it would for all of society. As of 2017, 61 percent of same-sex couples are married, an increase from 38 percent prior to Obergefell. A Pew survey in 2013 found 49 percent of LGBT people believe the best way to obtain acceptance and equality in society is through marriage.

Today I find this union precious, and I am grateful to experience it. Rather than “redefining” marriage, my husband and I were simply allowed to enjoy the personal and social benefits it offers. This alone is one of the goals of the social conservative movement in spirit.

People Who Think Differently Can Live Together

As a conservative, I believe we have a unified duty to protect and defend religious freedom, and no person should be forced to participate in any activity he or she morally opposes. I believe that marriage is itself a social good that builds civilization and develops peace, prosperity, and social unity in a unique way.

To defend all of our rights, we must stand together.

I hope those who agree would recognize the value in welcoming gay couples to help build that society. I stand with Christians and other conservative religious groups, as well as social conservatives in defending our culture from progressive domination, but I also hope to introduce the idea that my husband and I, as so many other conservative gay married couples, are not a part of those efforts at vindictively punishing their beliefs.

To repair society, we need unity and an appreciation of community, even if we disagree on the details. To fight the progressive takeover of our country, we must recognize mutually beneficial freedom and liberty and understand that our natural diversity is simply a consequence of that freedom. To defend all of our rights, we must stand together. I do not ask anyone to recognize my marriage personally, but we have an opportunity to amicably agree to disagree.

These bills, in my view, unnecessarily divide us and will not accomplish what the well-meaning legislators hope. Instead I ask them to see the benefit of conservative values in gay lives all across the country and perhaps reach out a hand so we can help them take on battles we can both agree deserve our passion. You don’t need to call Jacob my husband to call me a friend, but I would still like to share our happiness with you, and I hope you feel the same.

School Teaches 5-Year-Olds About Transgenderism WO Telling Parents,"In Arlington County, Virginia, not even kindergarteners are exempt from pro-transgender messaging. So reports T he Washington Post , which, earlier this month, featured an article about Ashlawn Elementary School, which honored National “Read Across America Day” by hosting a transgender spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign (HRC). The spokesperson read a story about a transgender child for a room full of kindergarten children.

Prominent media outlets claimed parents were notified beforehand and allowed opt their children out of the event. But those outlets got the story wrong. The letter, written solely in English despite the school’s sizable non-English-fluent population, nowhere mentions “opting out.”

Media, District Lie About Pro-Transgender Event

“Dozens of kindergarten students” sat cross-legged in homosexual activist teacher Jaim Foster’s classroom at Ashlawn Elementary School on February 28 while HRC representative and ‘“transgender rights advocate” Sarah McBride read them a picture book about a transgender girl. The book was “I Am Jazz” by Jazz Jennings, who talked about being a transgender teen on a TLC show.

Also in attendance was Lily Eskelsen García, president of the National Education Association (NEA), an organization that welcomed LGBT groups to serve as official sponsors of this year’s national reading event.

The Arlington school district claimed that “parents were notified by a letter ahead of time and were allowed to opt out of they chose.” Mainstream media crowed that no parents chose this option. One parent quoted by a local television channel stated: “We see children very young who know they don’t identify with the gender they are assigned. Wouldn’t it be better if their classmates understood and had empathy towards them versus treating them different or with disdain or violence?”

However, this record of events is not accurate. A copy of the February 22 letter provided to the Family Foundation of Virginia under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act shows absolutely no offer for parents to pull their kids out of the activity.

Moreover, although the letter notes that a book written by a transgender person would be read to the class, it does not explicitly say that kindergarteners will be told they may have a “girl brain but a boy body” or a boy brain and a girl body, as the book claims. Nor does it say that the kids would be read to by a cross-dressing man who calls himself “Sarah.” Rather, it says only that “there will be discussion around the big ideas of the books which are we want to accept and welcome all people.”

Although Ashlawn draws its students from a multilingual community in diverse northern Virginia — requiring a formal English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) program — the school provided only an English-language letter to parents. Linda Erdos, assistant superintendent for Arlington County Schools, claimed in an email to the Family Foundation of Virginia that “while the classes included a small number of students who speak another language at home, the parents of those students speak and read English as well as the second language.”

I previously taught high school ESOL in neighboring Fairfax County, and find it unlikely that every parent who doesn’t speak English as his or her first language fully understood what was being offered to his or her children.

Imposing LGBTQ Ideology on 5-Year-Olds

Apart from the misleading information provided by both the media and Arlington County Public Schools, there are more essential problems with events for children that promote explicitly LGBTQ ideology. Children are incredibly impressionable. As a father of a 6-year-old, 3-year-old, and 2-year-old, I have consistently witnessed them believing just about anything other children or adults tell them. If an adult tells them they may not the biological sex they presumed themselves to be, they are liable to start questioning themselves, even if this wasn’t anywhere near their mental radar.

Children and parents are not being told the whole truth regarding transgenderism, either. Former transgender person Walt Heyer has noted : “Parents need to know that up to 94 percent of school-age kids who identify as transgender will grow out of their desire to change genders as adults.” Moreover, data show that kids’ lives are put at risk when schools encourage them to identify themselves as gay or transgender at an early age. Heyer observes: “For each year children delay labeling themselves as LGBT, their suicide risk is reduced by 20 percent.”

Moreover, as the noted Dr. Leonard Sax has discussed , the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is officially recommending that the wishes of young children, including kindergarteners, be prioritized if they claim to reject their biological sex, including with “cross-sex hormones, castration, and infertility.” So public schools that teach transgender ideology to kindergarteners may be setting up their families for a medical hijacking if their confused child discusses the topic with the family pediatrician.

This prioritizes the whims of children over the wisdom and loving care of parents who disapprove of physical and hormonal castration for children, or simply prefer a “wait and see” approach. There is little evidence to substantiate the AAP’s recommendation, the implementation of which can and will cause irreparable damage to children.

Consider also the biased, preferential treatment of the HRC , NEA, and many public school districts. They promote those who pretend to be the opposite sex, and welcome their presence at public events meant to persuade those of all ages of the acceptableness of their decisions.

Assuming that any of this is age-appropriate for elementary schoolers, would any of these organizations or school districts welcome Walt Heyer, Jamie Shupe , or the many others who have similar stories of regret regarding their earlier gender transformation decisions ? Would they be willing to accept an alternative testimony that speaks of the potential risks and dangers involved? Would they allow a perspective from prominent lesbian and feminist activists who have declared the obvious truth that men are not women? Of course not.

This Is Coming to a Community Like Yours

Trends suggest that no part of America will be left untouched by this ideological campaign. As sociologist Mark Regnerus recently noted , self-identified transgender Americans once comprised around 0.3 percent of the population as recently as 2011. That doubled by 2016. A new study, relying on a statewide survey in Minnesota, revealed that 3 percent of adolescents now identify as transgender.

“The rapid onset of gender dysphoria among adolescents is odd,” observes Regnerus (to say the least). Meanwhile sociologists like Regnerus who make note of these bizarre, rapid social transformations are persecuted by the academy for exposing the connection between aggressive LGBTQ propaganda and rising rates of adolescent transgenderism.

Parents and all those who care about the welfare of our nation’s children must raise their voices regarding this aggressive offensive, lest their own families suffer the consequences . As I’ve argued elsewhere , many of America’s public schools are no longer safe places for our children.

As a product of public education and a former public school teacher, I mourn this circumstance with a heavy heart. But I also know that even homeschooling my kids or sending them to a private school is not necessarily a sufficient shield from the zealotry of LGBTQ advocacy that will not rest until every American, and every American educator, conforms. So much for diversity and pluralism.

Houston Library Features Child Molester Reading Trans Books To Children,"This article contains information and images not fit for children.

The Houston Public Library has apologized for featuring a convicted child molester last fall during its “Drag Queen Storytime” series. It has not, however, announced it will end the program that featured the male sex offender dressed up as a woman reading LGBT books to children as young as babies.

“A media spokesperson for the library confirmed one of the program’s drag queens, Tatiana Mala Nina, is Alberto Garza, a 32-year-old child sex offender,” reports local TV station KHOU. “In 2008, he was convicted of assaulting an 8-year-old boy.”

State records say the 200-pound, 5-foot-11 man was convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a child, is at a “moderate” risk for reoffending, and must report his whereabouts to police annually for the rest of his life. Garza’s YouTube channel showed he was in the process of transgendering himself, according to Rod Dreher (videos since removed; screenshot of Garza in drag captured here).

Drag Queen Storytime is spreading to libraries across the country, mostly but not exclusively in deeply Democratic locales. It even has a national PR webpage featuring an image of a scared toddler staring at a man dressed up in drag while the child’s mother encourages the child to get over the apprehension.

Notice that this is the exact opposite of what sexual assault prevention programs teach people to do: pay attention to and act on their feelings of discomfort, rather than overrule them. Child molesters are known for “grooming” potential victims, including by getting them used to ignoring worries and warnings from their consciences, confusing them about what is normal, and accepting increasingly transgressive behavior.

Here are some snaps from the Drag Queen Storytime Instagram page. Determine for yourself whether what they depict might fit into the category of grooming.

If you’re looking at this with a fair mind, it’s pretty easy to see that LGBT platitudes about “love” and “diversity” could malform children’s developing understanding of safe and appropriate sexual behavior. These platitudes have already been used to turn off the good judgment of the people who should be protecting children from potential harm, such as parents and librarians.

Five-Year-Olds Shouldn’t Be Learning About Anal Sex

Part of the problem is that it’s impossible to explain to a young child what “gay” or “transgender” is without also exposing her to concepts that are not appropriate for pre-pubescent children. It’s not true, for example, as the YouTube channel Queer Kids Stuff explains, that being gay just means: “When one person of one gender loves someone romantically who is the same gender. So, if a boy loves a boy, they’re gay. And if a girl loves a girl, they’re gay too. What if a person loves a person? They’re gay too.”

As everyone with any life experience knows, the vast majority of friendships among people of the same sex include no sexual activity or attraction. Women routinely love female relatives deeply with no sexuality involved, and the same is true for men. Emotional closeness does not suffice to define homosexuality, and telling kids it does risks teaching the falsehood that their childish affection for their best friend or father means they’re gay.

Gay people don’t look alike, act alike, have similar genetics or other biological characteristics, live exclusively near each other, or do (or be) any other thing that exclusively defines them as gay except for the type of sex they engage in. And prepubescent children simply are too young to be thinking about sex in the kind of specificity and detail required to explain that to them accurately.

They don’t need to know about oral or anal sex. They don’t need to know about men cutting off their penises and women cutting off their breasts to look more like the opposite sex. They shouldn’t be told damaging lies about how girls can have a boy’s body.

Until puberty, humans do not have biological sexual urges, and until that tandem physical and emotional maturation process begins, typically in middle school, it damages children’s moral, mental, and emotional development to expose them to these kinds of things. Some of these things should never be exposed or done to children, regardless of where they are in their sexual maturation.

Early sexual exposure leads to many harms and risks, such as earlier and riskier sexual activity and vulnerability to predators. Showing pornography is an extreme example (that child predators also use), but on the danger spectrum is also the sexualization of our culture that typically feminists complain about. Little girls wearing booty shorts, taking children to movies with sex scenes, and tween boys demanding sexts are a part of this emotional brutalization, this dulling of conscience and eradication of innocence.

A sane culture would work to reduce children’s exposure to adult material. In a sane culture, it would not take an actual child molester leading Drag Queen Storytime to make people question the idea of such an event.

Queering the Curriculum Is a Thing That’s Happening

It’s not solely storytimes grooming children for sexual confusion, either, it’s also sex ed curricula in many schools. Because 2013’s Supreme Court decision Obergefell v. Hodges forcibly instituted genderless marriages into the nation’s legal regime, public schools are now legally bound to teach about gay sex in sex ed. That trickle-down is hitting blue and purple states and cities first, but it’s going to eventually be everywhere because the law demands treating gay and heterosexual sex as the same.

In Colorado, what that means is legislators drafting a mandate for “comprehensive sex ed” curriculum for all children in public schools ages 4-12. Four. Age four. What could four-year-olds be learning under this pending law? Well, the bill would mandate that children learn about “the relational or sexual experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender individuals,” and “gender, gender expression, gender identity” — i.e., transgenderism. California and New York already have instituted such curricula in their public schools.

Many schools don’t need a mandate, however. Last November, a Colorado elementary school herded children from kindergarten through fifth grade into their auditorium to watch videos from the above-quoted Queer Kids Stuff YouTube channel. Accompanying lesson plans ask kids to write down what “gay” means after having watched the video explaining “gay” can mean “When a person loves a person.” If that’s the definition, we’re all gay. And if we’re all gay, gay doesn’t mean anything, and there’d be no need to teach it to four-year-olds.

Another lesson plan for another video asks kids to define “Bisexual” as “When a boy or girl loves other boys and girls,” and shows kids pictures of celebrities who label themselves bisexual. A later lesson tells kids to mark “False” at the statement “Doctors are always right when they say a new baby is a boy or girl.”

Schools also don’t need a sex ed class to teach children about adult sex topics starting at age four. Activists are working to embed LGBT material across classes. Just one example is A Queer Endeavor, a project of two education professors at the University of Colorado at Bolder that has taught about 5,000 teachers so far how to “integrate topics of gender and sexual diversity across program areas and teacher-preparation coursework.”

From Queering Classrooms to Queering Culture

One wonders whether there is any connection between queering classrooms and libraries and documented spikes in transgenderism among children, in both the United States and United Kingdom. Sociologist Mark Regnerus observes at First Things, “What had once comprised around 0.3 percent of the population as recently as 2011 has vaulted to 0.6 percent by 2016, with adolescent transgender self-identification comprising 0.7 percent. But a new study in Pediatrics, leaning on a statewide survey in Minnesota, revealed a figure just under 3 percent, four times as large as the Williams estimate. In other words, the adolescent transgender population has grown extraordinarily quickly.”

A recent Brown University study found that teens were more likely to identify as transgender if their peers and school culture were anti-heterosexual and heavy on identity politics. A cynic would wonder whether this is partially the point of these high-pressure social and legal campaigns.

Given that transgender identification is also related to trauma — about half the kids in the study who quickly identified as transgender had recently experienced significant emotional trauma, and of course it’s traumatic to cut off one’s healthy body parts and obsess over dildos in elementary school — this further reinforces the conclusion queering schools and storytimes doesn’t need to involve actual child molesters to pose a clear threat to children.

"Marriage Isn’t About Making Adults Feel Nice, It’s About Raising Children","I read Chad Felix Greene’s recent Federalist article with interest because it addressed the institution of marriage and gay people, both of which are very close to my heart. I wouldn’t be the woman I am today without the distinct influence of my mother, who has been with her female partner for more than 30 years. I love Greene’s effort to close the distance between conservatives who continue to support traditional marriage and our gay brothers and sisters.

The good news is there’s not much ground to cover, because the vast majority of conservatives recognize the value and dignity of those who identify as gay. Nearly every single one of us has close LGBT family and friends.

Despite the popular narrative, our opposition to gay marriage has nothing to do with hatred, phobia, or distance from the LGBT community. It is grounded in the understanding that we can’t redefine an institution that nearly every religion and culture has supported throughout history without society-wide consequences.

Marriage Isn’t Only About Adult Feelings

Greene wrote, “It became important to me that creating a new legal right did not infringe on the rights of others.” On that we should all agree. He went on to address the group he believed was most at risk of this infringement—religious Americans. Indeed, the threat to religious liberty arrived about five minutes after the Obergefell ruling was delivered.

I’m grateful that Greene and other gay conservatives are fighting against the religious bigotry being imposed on people of faith this era of “tolerance.” However, gay marriage presents a separate and much more significant threat to the fundamental rights of another vulnerable group, and it’s a threat that goes far beyond photo-taking and cake-baking.

Greene wondered if “those who view marriage as a good for society also see the good it has offered myself and Jacob.” I’m glad his marriage has benefited him; my marriage has done the same for me. But the state does not hand out marriage licenses so it can put a stamp of approval on anyone’s love life.

No, government’s concern with marriage is not nearly as sentimental. Rather, the state’s interest stems from a biological reality that judicial fiat is powerless to change—the reality that heterosexual sex produces babies. When Congress enacted the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 1996, they made that interest abundantly clear: “At bottom, civil society has an interest in maintaining and protecting the institution of heterosexual marriage because it has a deep and abiding interest in encouraging responsible procreation and child-rearing. Simply put, government has an interest in marriage because it has an interest in children.”

Legal expert Austin R. Nimocks puts it this way: “Marriage laws stem from the fact that children are the natural product of sexual relationships between men and women, and that both fathers and mothers are viewed to be necessary and important for children. Thus, throughout history, diverse cultures and faiths have recognized marriage between one man and one woman as the best way to promote healthy families and societies.”

Since DOMA, marriage law has radically changed. But the facts that 1) children are the natural product of sexual relationships between men and women, 2) both fathers and mothers are necessary and important for children, and 3) marriage between one man and woman is the best way to promote healthy families and societies certainly have not. In fact, out-of-wedlock births have risen sharply since 1996, so the need for marriage as an incentive to encourage men to commit to the mother of their children has only increased.

Unfortunately, we now have a brand of marriage that officially considers those men “optional.” It’s as if all those religious types carrying on about traditional marriage were on to something.

The Real Victims Aren’t Grownups

As many of us forecasted, gay marriage did not simply “create a new legal right” for our same-sex-attracted countrymen. The effects of same-sex marriage are diametrically opposed to a much more primal and ancient right: a child’s rights to his or her mother and father. No matter what the uber-woke bumper sticker says, these two rights cannot COEXIST.

The problem stems from the law equating two very different things. While there may be no difference between the commitment Greene and I have for our husbands, there is a stark difference in what our two pairings provide to children. But because the law now demands that the two couplings be treated equally in matters of parenthood, that same law must now codify what biology prohibits — namely, making two adults of the same sex the parents of a child.

Historically, marriage has always been about babies, so when you redefine marriage, you redefine parenthood as well. Globally, wherever gay marriage goes, the rights of children are weakened. In the wake of the SCOTUS decision to impose gay marriage on the entire nation, state after state is now scrubbing parenthood laws of references to “mother” and “father” in the name of “non-discrimination.” Last year the sponsor of the child-commodifying Uniform Parentage Act here in Washington State plainly said that laws recognizing mothers and fathers were “unconstitutional” in the wake of Obergefell.

Let me pause and clarify: I am not saying that gays and lesbians cannot be good parents. Most of what I do well as a mom I do because that’s how my mother parented me. What I am saying is that neither my mother nor her partner could be a father to me. Thankfully neither tried to be, and I benefited from my father’s love and involvement in my life until he passed away three years ago.

Because of Obergefell, my mom and her partner can now marry if they choose to. But because of that same ruling, my father and mother are now considered legally optional to my health, development, and identity. Yet nothing could be farther from the truth; both have been crucial to me, and are to all children.

When children are included in the “constellation of benefits” that Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy promised gay couples, it means adults have a “right” to parenthood, even if one or both of the child’s natural parents must be cut out of the equation. Historically, parenthood has been recognized on a biological basis or upon completion of the adoption process. But new “non-discrimination” parenthood laws deem any adult the parent of a child created via reproductive technologies if they “intend” to parent, even if the “intended” parent has no genetic connection to the child.

“Intent-based” parenthood laws omit the extensive screening, vetting, and training required in the adoption process. That’s a problem because statistically, non-biological parents are less protective of, attached to, and invested in children. Studies show that children living with an unrelated adult male are the most likely to suffer abuse. These parenthood laws place children in high-risk households in the name of progress.

All of these changes to parenthood functionally turns children into commodities the state can award to whichever adults have the money and means to acquire them. In the words of Rabbi Gilles Bernheim, gay marriage has transformed children into “objects of rights, rather than subjects of rights.”

Some Stories You Might Not Have Heard

Gay marriage was pushed and passed because LGBT adults did a great job of doing what Greene did in his Federalist article—telling their stories of loss and longing. But other stories were not told in the run-up to the SCOTUS decision because many of these storytellers were afraid to come out of the closet. Stories of loss and longing like these will only grow in the wake of this new “civil right.”

‘I yearned for the affection that my friends received from their dads. I wanted to know what it was like to be held and cherished by a man.’

“I yearned for the affection that my friends received from their dads. I wanted to know what it was like to be held and cherished by a man… As far as I was concerned, I already had one mother; I did not need another… My grandfathers and uncles did the best they could when it came to spending time with me and doing all the daddy-daughter stuff, but it was not the same as having a full-time father, and I knew it. It always felt secondhand. Growing up without the presence of a man in my home damaged me personally,” says Brandi Walton.

Samantha, raised by her father and his partner, talks about the moment she realized she didn’t have a mother: “At the end of Kindergarten, we had a free day at school. We got to watch a movie in the gym, The Land Before Time. It is a classic movie. But for me it was a traumatic experience. I watched, eyes glued, as Littlefoot lost his Mother. Littlefoot had a ‘Mother’ and she died saving his life. Littlefoot spent the entire movie mourning the loss of his ‘Mother.’ It was in that moment, as a five year old girl, that I realized there was such a thing as a mother. It was also in that moment that I realized that I did not have one. I spent the rest of our free day at the gym crying into the arms of a teacher I would never see again for a mother that I never knew I never had.”

Millie Fontana speaks about feeling guilty for wanting her missing father, even though she had two mothers: “You would see every other child embracing who they are on Mother and Father’s Day. They would be rejoicing and celebrating with their parents and their family members, and there I was sitting back wondering what is wrong with me and why don’t I have that connection with my father… the lies went on, you know, ‘You don’t have a father’… and ‘You have another mother’, as though that statement was enough to conceal the emotions inside me and offer me stability. I suffered guilt, because who was I to reject this other parent? And, oh my gosh, if she is really what is supposed to fulfill me, how horrible must I be to reject that notion?”

We all come from a man and woman, and long to be known and loved by that man and woman. It’s one of the few universal experiences that we all share.

Greene suggests that supporters of traditional marriage should “reach out a hand” so we can battle together in areas where our passion overlaps. I will gladly extend a hand of friendship to him (I am already one of your Twitter fans, Chad, and I hope that you look me up the next time you come to Seattle).

I believe Greene when he says he does not want his ability to marry Jacob to infringe on the rights of others, so I also want to extend to them a hand of partnership in the fight for children’s rights—their right to be known and loved by their mother and father. Children have a right to the two people who are statistically the most likely to protect them, invest in them, and provide for them. They have a right to the two people from whom they inherited their biological identity. They have a right to the two people who automatically furnish them with both the maternal and paternal love that children crave.

In the 2019 culture of intersectionality, the reality that we all come from a man and woman, and long to be known and loved by that man and woman, is one of the few universal experiences that we all share. That’s why we are building a global coalition of children’s rights activists that spans the spectrum of religious and sexual identities. Greene and his husband would be welcome additions.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/03/21/marriage-isnt-making-adults-feel-nice-raising-children/,2019-03-21
"How The Equality Act Threatens Speech, Religion, And Women’s Rights","With renewed passion and a sense of progress in the endless political battle for power, Democrats have once again introduced a bill they believe they may finally have the ability to pass. The Equality Act has been a constant feature in the debate over LGBT law in the United States for some time. The act has become a symbol of LGBT achievement, recognition, and validation, replacing same-sex marriage as a rallying cry for justice and progress.

The bill would amend The Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include sexual orientation and gender identity as federally protected classes. The Human Rights Campaign activist organization states, “The patchwork nature of current laws leaves millions of people subject to uncertainty and potential discrimination that impacts their safety, their families, and their day-to-day lives.”

Despite the universal appeal of the name and its noble promises, which 69 percent of Americans support in concept, the act poses a major risk to those who value religious freedom, state independence, and women’s rights.

Could This Force Churches to Host Gay Weddings?

Gregory Angelo, a pioneer in Republican advocacy for gay rights, recently published a detailed argument titled “Don’t fall for the ‘Equality Act’,” addressing concerns about the act’s effects on religious freedom. He warns, “Don’t be fooled by the name: The Equality Act is legislation that would compromise American civil rights and religious liberty as we know it.”

The act would ban the following locations from “discriminating” against individuals based on sexual or gender identity: a “stadium or other place of or establishment that provides exhibition, entertainment, recreation, exercise, amusement, gathering, or display; any establishment that provides a good, service, or program, including a store, shopping center, online retailer or service provider, salon, bank, gas station, food bank, service or care center, shelter, travel agency, or funeral parlor, or establishment that provides health care, accounting, or legal services; any train service, bus service, car service, taxi service, airline service, station, depot, or other place of or establishment that provides transportation service.”

Most importantly, “The bill prohibits the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 from providing a claim, defense, or basis for challenging such protections.” The bill essentially nullifies federal and state religious freedom protections by handing authority to the U.S. Department of Justice to interpret and investigate claims of discrimination.

While this does not directly indicate, as Angelo writes, that churches would be forced to accommodate same-sex weddings, the language is vague enough in specifying “public accommodations” and “any establishment” to make the concern an issue. Considering the aggressiveness in which we have witnessed LGBT advocates pursue the smallest of infractions in small businesses catering to same-sex weddings, it is no longer an option to assume future advocates will honor the restraint and tolerance promised today.

As Angelo predicts, “In the run-up to the United States Supreme Court marriage equality decisions of 2013 and 2015, gay advocates such as myself promised those we disagreed with that allowing same-sex couples to marry would have no effect on them, their families, or their faith. Passage of the ‘Equality Act’ would make liars out of the lot of us.”

Fanning the Flames of Controversy

The Advocate, an LGBT legacy publication, attacked Angelo by saying his op-ed “is now being used by extremists to foster opposition.” Citing the Southern Poverty Law Center’s designation of Liberty Counsel as a “hate group,” the article warns that the organization is “encouraging followers to flood their congressional representatives with message denouncing the pro-LGBTQ bill.”

Angelo responded to the accusations and misrepresentation of his argument in a series of tweets, while clarifying the true concerns surrounding this bill, which he and I both agree is far from “pro-LGBTQ.” It seems the left simply refuses to honestly discuss what they are proposing.

The bill argues “Regular and ongoing discrimination against LGBT people, as well as women, in accessing public accommodations contributes to negative social and economic outcomes, and in the case of public accommodations operated by State and local governments, abridges individuals’ constitutional rights.” It cites “conversion therapy” as a form of “discrimination” against LGBT people.

It states without citation that, “LGBT people often face discrimination when seeking to rent or purchase housing, as well as in every other aspect of obtaining and maintaining housing.” The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development performed a survey in 2013 that tested emailing applications in 50 large cities for rentals using opposite-sex and same-sex names and reported same-sex emails received fewer responses. Citing a separate study performed by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2001, however, only 3.8 percent of LGBT people reported experiencing discrimination in housing.

Threats to Women’s Safety

Despite advocating for protecting women’s access in public accommodation, as Abigail Shrier writes, “The Equality Act sacrifices female safety in restrooms, locker rooms and even domestic-violence shelters.” In fact, the bill very clearly states its intent in this area regarding gender identity: “an individual shall not be denied access to a shared facility, including a restroom, a locker room, and a dressing room, that is in accordance with the individual’s gender identity.”

The term “sex” in previous amendments to the Constitution exclusively referred to women’s rights and access, although the equality aspect meant both men and women should be treated equally. The argument now is that “sex” includes sexual orientation and gender identity, effectively nullifying sex-based protections for women and their ability to protest open access to sex-segregated spaces by men.

Finally, as Angelo perfectly describes in his article, the act is a direct affront to the original purpose of The Civil Rights Act of 1964 to protect African Americans from discrimination nationwide. “For many African-Americans, the Civil Rights Act is more than mere legislation; it holds a sacred place in our nation’s history as a moment in which Congress acted to right the terrible injustice of segregation that persisted more than a century after the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution.” He notes that major African American civil rights groups are absent from the list of 288 organizations supporting the bill.

LGBT People Aren’t Often Discriminated Against

I have opposed The Equality Act for a long time, and my opposition is founded on slightly different grounds than those I have cited here. My first argument, a common theme in my writing on LGBT topics, is that there simply is no need for federal LGBT protections.

Despite repeated claims, the most-cited studies of LGBT discrimination come from self-reported “Have you ever…”-style questionnaires, not firm examples. Data we have indicates workplace discrimination is incredibly rare. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reported as of 2017 that only 4.3 percent of 1,762 complaints they received from LGBT people were found to have “reasonable cause,” with 83 percent having no legitimate basis or closed for lack of evidence.

Of Fortune 500 companies, 89 percent self-impose expansive anti-discrimination policies to protect LGBT employees. Empowering the DOJ to directly intervene in claims of LGBT discrimination, as The Equality Act would do, would simply incentivize abusive reporting and waste resources while intimidating businesses. We have seen too much evidence to doubt that small businesses would be targeted solely on the basis they are owned by Christians. The act elevates the power to bully beyond the ability for the average citizen to fight.

This Bill Would Make Discrimination Worse

Second, my opposition is in the power transfer to the federal government to determine the proper definitions and limitations of sexual and gender identity. The states currently have fewer and fewer options in self-regulation, and this bill would bind them to a centralized authority in all matters of identity politics. As the Heritage Foundation warns, “the Equality Act would further inequality by penalizing everyday Americans for their beliefs about marriage and biological sex.”

The states currently have fewer and fewer options in self-regulation, and this bill would bind them to a centralized authority in all matters of identity politics.

To be clear, this bill would create a protected class based on belief alone while providing the federal government the power to punish disbelief. Regardless of the promised benefits, as an American citizen who values liberty, I simply cannot support such a massive abuse of power.

Finally, the bill is merely a stepping stone for codifying progressive beliefs into absolute legal standards the average American will have no ability to challenge. Already the language is outdated, as it limits “sexual orientation” to heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual. The LGBT designation currently includes dozens of sexual orientations that fall well outside of these bounds. How long until The Equality Act is accused of not being inclusive enough and further revisions are needed?

Do we want the federal government controlled by the obsessive micromanaging of intersectional identity politics without boundaries? It is not an understatement to recognize that this bill is a culture-changing move and it will be exceptionally difficult to recover from its impact.

For years I and many others have tried to warn of this power grab, and unfortunately the Republican Party has paid little attention to our concerns. The name alone is intimidating, as no one wants to oppose the “Equality” Act, but Democrats have proven they will push forward the moment they have the slightest advantage in doing so.

We cannot shrug our shoulders and wait for the next opportunity to fight back. Without direct opposition to this bill, much of what we have fought for to protect freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and women’s rights as a party over the last decade will be completely nullified.

Yale Law Yanks Stipends From Students Who Work For Christian Firms,"Several weeks ago, I wrote about the challenges of being a Christian and a conservative at Yale Law School. A few days ago, the law school decided to double down and prove my point.

After the Yale Federalist Society invited an attorney from Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a prominent Christian legal group, to speak about the Masterpiece Cakeshop case, conservative students faced backlash. Outlaws, the law school’s LGBTQ group, demanded that Yale Law School “clarify” its admissions policies for students who support ADF’s positions. Additionally, Outlaws insisted that students who work for religious or conservative public interest organizations such as ADF during their summers should not receive financial support from the law school.

On March 25, one month after the controversy, Yale Law School announced via email that it was extending its nondiscrimination policy to summer public interest fellowships, postgraduate public interest fellowships, and loan forgiveness for public interest careers. The school will no longer provide financial support for students and graduates who work at organizations that discriminate on the basis of “sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.”

Yale based its decision on a unanimous recommendation from the school’s Public Interest Committee. The committee explained: “The logic of our broader recommendation is that Yale Law School does not and should not support discrimination against its own students, financially or otherwise. Obviously, the Law School cannot prohibit a student from working for an employer who discriminates, but that is not a reason why Yale Law School should bear any obligation to fund that work, particularly if that organization does not give equal employment opportunity to all of our students.”

The law school also thanked Outlaws for raising this issue.

Too Vague and Broad

Conservative students who read the announcement were outraged. At first glance, the policy looks like it applies to organizations with disfavored policy positions. A student working for ADF, for example, would not receive school funding because ADF advocates for natural marriage.

In private emails to students, however, the Yale administration has been presenting a narrower explanation of the new policy. The school’s funding restrictions will only apply to organizations with disfavored hiring practices.

While admitting that there are still many details to be worked out, Yale currently says it envisions a self-certification process for employers. For a Yale student to receive a summer public interest fellowship, the employer must certify that it is in compliance with Yale’s nondiscrimination policy. If an organization does not self-certify, then the student will receive no financial support from the law school.

For organizations like ADF, this presents a problem. ADF employees must sign a statement of faith in which they affirm—among other principles—the Christian sexual ethic. This ethic teaches that “all forms of sexual immorality (including adultery, fornication, homosexual behavior, polygamy, polyandry, bestiality, incest, pornography, and acting upon any disagreement with one’s biological sex) are sinful and offensive to God.”

When asked specifically about ADF, Yale officials claimed they do not know enough about ADF’s hiring practices to make a determination. However, they admitted that if ADF does not certify that it will comply with Yale’s policy, then students working for ADF will be ineligible for public interest fellowships and the loan forgiveness program.

Discriminating Against Christians Is Totally Acceptable

When questioned about this new policy, Yale officials act puzzled as to why religious and conservative students and alumni are so worried. There are several reasons to be concerned.

First, Yale’s only assurances that the policy will be limited to hiring practices, and not applied to policy positions, are private emails sent to individual students. This is not enough. What ultimately matters is the text of the policy. Behind-the-scenes promises about how the policy will be interpreted and applied are not binding. The law school’s public position is too vague.

Second, even if this new policy is limited to hiring practices, it’s still deeply troubling. The policy was obviously a response to ADF. Yale made this clear when it thanked Outlaws for raising this issue, which was in the context of a protest against ADF. And in announcing the new policy, Yale said, “while the law governing nondiscrimination against LGBTQ people is subject to contestation, the Law School’s commitment to LGBTQ equality is not.”

Without naming ADF, Yale has found a roundabout way to functionally blacklist them and other organizations that do not adhere to Yale’s progressive understanding of gender identity. Law students and graduates will still receive funding to work at organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union that defend abortion, for example. But if students and graduates want to work for ADF or other similarly situated religious or conservative organizations, they will get no help.

Finally, Yale has already caved to one progressive demand by restricting financial support for conservative students. Who is to say that the school will not cave again and start denying admission to conservative applicants? There were certainly calls among the student body to do so. Progressive students are attempting to shrink the Overton Window of reasonable public discourse, and Yale seems all too willing to comply.

I still believe that there is plenty of good at Yale. As Justice Kavanaugh said, we should all strive to be “on the sunrise side of the mountain.” I am incredibly lucky to be here and am determined to leave this school without any anger or bitterness. But they’re making it hard.

"Feminists Couldn't Get Trans Out Of Public Schools, But Muslims Did","In the United Kingdom, where the LGBT+ agenda is well entrenched in the school system, there have been protests from the Muslim population against these so-called teachings of tolerance. In Birmingham, a program called No Outsiders, organized by Andrew Moffatt, has been on the curriculum to teach students as young as five the ins and outs of same-sex families, inclusivity, and diversity.

Moffatt, who is deputy head teacher at Parkfield Community School, developed the program “to ensure future younger generations learn about acceptance and respect of others.” While that’s a rather non-offensive ethos, what sowed tensions in the community was the introduction of LGBT+ content in the program.

The Brits have typically been gung-ho for the gender unicorn, accepting trans women on short lists of women politicians, allowing males who identify as transgender — including sex offenders — to be housed in women’s prisons and battered women’s shelters, and being extremely accommodating about pronouns and National Health Service (NHS) facilitation of transgender medical interventions. But for the most part, those who tasted the rainbow were basic, white English folks.

Controversy in the Muslim Community

Then religious Muslims got wind of the LGBT+ indoctrination of their primary school students, and freaked out. According to these parents, who staged protests outside of the schools in their districts that offer the No Outsiders program, homosexuality is not sanctioned by their religion, and they don’t want their children taught that it’s acceptable. The parents’ protests included pulling more than 600 Muslim children from school, and were incredibly effective. The lessons have stopped.

The funny part is that gender-critical British feminists have been protesting this stuff for a while, and their lamentations have fallen on deaf ears. Moreover, they’ve been badgered, brought up on charges, called bigots and TERFs, been doxxed, harassed, and fired from their posts, all for saying that perhaps the LGBT+ agenda is moving too fast through the social and educational system, and could be harming children instead of helping them. But now that an ethnic, religiously practicing minority takes issue with the program, it’s been put on pause. Why?

For one thing, the UK’s Labour Party has been courting Muslim immigrants, using identity politics and favorable immigration policies as a lure. Muslims in England do tend to vote Labour, but that won’t last long if the social attitudes advocated by the leftist party undermine the more conservative values of an immigrant group that tends to replicate the conservative social fabric of the home nations.

Wanting to bolster the ranks of Labour is only part of it. If it were the only aspect that matters, then Labour would not be so quick to dismiss the women who have of late been leaving the party due to conflicts over the LGBT+ agenda in education and health care.

To understand why it matters when an ethnic minority takes issue with an otherwise well-accepted social agenda, but not when English women have problems with it, it’s imperative to look at the driving moral standard of our time: moral relativism. Moral relativism is the idea that there is no objective, moral truth. That each individual’s, or groups’, perspective on right and wrong are, in fact, right and wrong for them; that there’s no objective reason to prefer one set of moral guidelines over any other.

Moral Relativism Meets Privilege Theory

However, when we combine moral relativism with privilege theory, we land in something of a muddle, where there is a reason to elevate the moral position of those who are less privileged over those who are more privileged. That means that, because British women who have a moral view against LGBT+ indoctrination in schools are more privileged than those who are LBGT+ and want the lessons to proceed, the lessons will proceed. But when an ethnic minority that scores less privilege points than English members of the LGBT+ community opposes to the program, their moral perspective supersedes the claim of the LGBT+ group.

It is not the moral perspective that matters here—otherwise the lessons would have stopped when the gender-critical feminists got on board—but the identity of the group. The moral perspective of the most oppressed identity group wins the day, which is certainly a subset of moral relativism because the morals themselves are still irrelevant. It is only the holder of the perspective, and his right to hold any perspective he chooses, that is relevant.

This is an odd application of moral relativism, where greater value is placed on historically underrepresented perspectives within a dominant, Western culture, and lesser value is placed on the grounding moral principles of that dominant, Western culture, but because it makes no claim that any one moral principle itself is more moral than any other, it is still very much within the framework of relativism.

Perhaps, then, it’s time for a refresher on how best to apply the principle of moral relativism, so the morals are given equal weight, as opposed to the identities that espouse them affecting the relevance of a moral view.

Moral Relativism Muddles Everything

The case of the example at hand is a great one to get started with. We have one group of people being told that their view is unacceptable, and another group of people who espouse the same view being told that their view is acceptable. However, in moral relativism, if one culture or group is held to a standard or lack thereof, the standard must be applied to cultures or groups equally. Therefore, if it’s okay to be Muslim and opposed to LGBT+ ideological indoctrination, it’s okay to be a native British female and be opposed to it as well.

Relativism means that all people are only held to the standards to which they hold themselves, perhaps only for the duration for which they hold them. It does not mean holding the members of your own, dominant culture to a set of standards to which you would not hold another culture.

In this example, if the British women are trans-exclusionary radical feminists (TERFs) who do not deserve to be heard on gender indoctrination in school, so too are the Muslim parents bigoted TERFs, who do not deserve hearing. Just as mums on Mumsnet (a popular parenting site in the UK) are told that their little Girl Guides can sleep separate from the troop if they are uneasy sharing tents with boys who call themselves girls, so too should the leaders of the LGBT+ program be pleased that the Muslim parents have taken it upon themselves to remove their children from school.

To respect a culture’s right to implement laws and customs in opposition to women’s rights, racial equality, sanctity of life, child labor, and yes, LGBT+ rights simply because there are less of those who subscribe to that culture within the dominant culture of the west, is to not believe in those things at all. If all it takes is for an ethnic minority of religious folks to put the damper on LGBT+ lessons in primary school education, then perhaps those who formulated the lessons don’t really believe it. Otherwise, why wouldn’t they stand up for it against the Muslim parents the same way as they stood up for it against the British ones?

To hold the dominant Western culture to one set of standards, but to hold a culture that opposes the grounding views of Western culture to a different set of standards is to have no basis upon which to hold fast the standards that are essential for free life in a democracy. The West must hold fast to the standards of individual freedom, not group identity, as a driving factor for law making and social interaction.

It is okay to have standards. Without moral standards, liberally applied, there is no way to make judgments, and no way to stand up for what we believe.

Mike Pence And Chick-Fil-A's Hatred Towards Gay People Is A Myth,"Many have argued that resentment and hostility in the LGBT movement was fully justified at one time. The religious right focused heavily on homosexuality and often disregarded how its messaging affected gay individuals. Many organizations and writing careers grew out of combating a narrative that felt unfair and hateful.

In many ways it was the advocacy of love, tolerance, and normalcy from much of gay media that successfully integrated gay people into society. But the progressive instinct to perpetually challenge the status quo and demand change by any means necessary, as well as its fixation on past sins, has taken the gay movement into the very depths of hatred and bigotry it long fought to remove from society.

Today we see unreasonable targeted hostility toward people of faith who seem more than willing to compromise for a peaceful society. It is more common for a Christian to be told her assumed religious beliefs are hateful than to see a Christian berating a gay person in public about his views on homosexuality.

The most recent Pew Research poll in 2017 found 35 percent of evangelicals support same-sex marriage. Clearly there is a significant and growing gap between how the LGBT left perceives the world and how Christians actually live in it. Two prominent examples of how this plays out in the media entertain Chick-fil-A as a champion of anti-LGBT legal and social advocacy, and Vice President Mike Pence as an anti-LGBT leader influencing national policy.

‘If You Really Love LGBTQ People,’ Boycott Chick-fil-A

Noah Michelson, the editorial director of HuffPost Personal, argued in his article, “If You Really Love LGBTQ People, You Just Can’t Keep Eating Chick-fil-A,” that queer people and their allies have an obligation to continue fighting Christian advocacy. “[W]hen a corporation is wafting its anti-queer stance directly under your nose, as Chick-fil-A has and continues to do, not giving them more money to use against us is a no-brainer.” He was responding to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey innocently boosting the restaurant after eating there. (Dorsey quickly apologized.)

In 2012, Chick-fil-A owner Dan Cathy advocated for traditional marriage and argued that marriage held biblical meaning and could not be so easily manipulated by society. He stated, “We know that it might not be popular with everyone, but thank the Lord, we live in a country where we can share our values and operate on biblical principles.”

He later discussed the effects of potentially isolating segments of the population from his restaurant by saying, “I think the time of truths and principles are captured and codified in God’s word and I’m just personally committed to that,” he said. “I know others feel very different from that and I respect their opinion and I hope that they would be respectful of mine.”

This declaration of respectful tolerance did not move Michelson, who argued that the organization donated millions to “anti-LGBT” groups in 2009. The list of organizations includes the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and Focus on the Family, as well as $1,000 to the now-defunct Exodus International.

Of course, in 2009, President Barack Obama and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton held the identical view on marriage, as did a significant majority of the American population. In 2012, while Hillary remained squarely on the side of Chick-fil-A, the drag queen group DWV released a parody song titled “Chow Down at Chick-fil-A” (NSFW), an anthem to encourage gays to protest the restaurant by eating there. Chick-fil-A has never been known to discriminate against LGBT customers or employees and never sought any action towards the group or YouTube for the video’s false accusations.

In March of this year, Chick-fil-A’s continued support for various Christian organizations was once again denounced, this time via a Vox headline, “Chick-fil-A’s charitable foundation kept donating to anti-LGBTQ groups.” The article says “The Chick-fil-A Foundation donated more than $1.8 million to three groups with a history of anti-LGBTQ discrimination in 2017, according to recently released tax filings analyzed by ThinkProgress.”

The three organizations in question are the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, Paul Anderson Youth Home (a Christian organization helping troubled youth), and the Salvation Army. The three Christian organizations in no way discriminate against people based on their sexuality but do advocate a biblical view of homosexuality. This is a private and voluntary experience for everyone involved and none of the organizations protest, provoke, or instigate hostilities towards LGBT people or groups.

Mike Pence Has No Record of Treating LGBT People Poorly

Naturally, Pence has been a target of anti-LGBT accusations for some time now, despite repeated debunking of the various claims against him. Most recently, openly gay Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg reflected on his experience coming to terms with his sexuality and his faith. He said, “That’s the thing that I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand. That if you have a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.”

The vice president was never involved in this conversation and did nothing to provoke the response from Buttigieg. In fact, in 2015, when Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, came out, then-Indiana governor Pence responded by saying, “I hold Mayor Buttigieg in the highest personal regard. We have a great working relationship. I see him as a dedicated public servant, and a patriot.” Also in 2015, Pence tweeted, “If I saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple, I wouldn’t eat there anymore.”

Both Chick-fil-A and Pence demonstrate a growing trend in American Christianity to be vocally respectful of liberal social issues while privately embracing religious tradition and morality that directly affects their own lives. The controversy does not come from what Christians, as a group, do to LGBT people, but what LGBT people speculate Christians must collectively and individually think and feel about the LGBT movement as a whole.

Pence is remarkably tolerant in every sense of the word, separating his personal religious views from his personal and professional relationships in a way as to not impose on anyone else. He is the ideal example of Christians coexisting in a secular society, and he has been repeatedly kind, generous, polite, and welcoming to LGBT Americans in every scenario he encounters them.

There is not a single example of Pence in his professional leadership role being rude, disrespectful, or hostile towards a gay person in the years he has been vice president, governor, or a member of Congress. Remarkably, no one accuses him of doing so privately either. To demonstrate this, in response to Buttigieg’s recent statement, “Pence insiders said they are shocked since he has not said anything derogatory about ‘Mayor Pete’ or his marriage to Chasten Buttigieg.”

No Malice Directed Toward LGBT People

In the same way, Chick-fil-A is an open and welcoming environment and no one, from customers to employees, is treated poorly for any reason. Their sole unforgivable sin is supporting charitable organizations that reflect their religious ideals and also happen to be conservative on the issues of secularism and sexuality.

The organization has gone out of its way to demonstrate no malicious intent whatsoever toward LGBT people. In 2017, Chick-fil-A said in a statement, “Since the Chick-fil-A Foundation was created in 2012, our giving has always focused on youth and education. We have never donated with the purpose of supporting a social or political agenda. There are 140,000 people—black, white; gay, straight; Christian, non-Christian—who represent Chick-fil-A. We are the sum of many experiences, but what we all have in common is a commitment to providing great food, genuine hospitality, and a welcoming environment to all of our guests.”

What we are seeing now is a profound intolerance to the most moderate social expression of Christian faith in our country. If anything, the hateful, bigoted Christian lives in the mind of the progressive as a mythical collection of ideas, and the more they seek to marginalize and shame the most mainstream views of Christians as extreme, the more hatred they create in their own communities.

This Hate Crime Helps Show How To Know Real Ones From Hoaxes,"In national conversations about hate crimes, members of the media tend to rely on emotional rhetoric rather than rational evaluation of the facts. Despite aggravated assault making up 19.5 percent of hate crimes in 2017, the idea of random acts of hate-motivated violence inspires most of the fear and activism against hate crimes nationwide. Of the total number of hate crimes affecting persons in 2017 in all categories, 79 percent were nonviolent.

To the public imagination, though, the concept of hate crimes conjures images of innocent people being targeted and brutally attacked merely for who they are. Despite many highly publicized incidents turning out to be hoaxes, hate crimes still drive a great deal of media attention. We have become accustomed to making arguments decrying the potential for true victims to be further victimized by lack of public trust in media and that real hate crimes do still happen. Here is an example of one of those true cases.

In July 2018, around 3:30 a.m., 24-year-old Brandon M. Wiley told the police that a 39-year-old gay man propositioned him and grabbed him in a sexual manner. In response, he beat the man, then later posted bloody pictures of himself on social media bragging about the assault.

The victim of the assault was found by police after a security guard witnessed the assault and suffered “multiple serious facial injuries, including a broken nose and fractured orbital sockets.” In April 2019, Wiley pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and police confirmed with video and witnesses that the victim had not molested him. Hate crime charges have been added, and Wiley is scheduled for sentencing in June.

What Makes This Hate Crime Plausible?

Multiple factors of this story illustrate the anatomy of a true hate crime. The first, and most important factor, was a neutral third party. A security guard just happened to pass by when the assault happened and was able to see specific details. Witnesses are one of the most important pieces of evidence as they allow more than one perspective to the crime. Hoax hate crimes often lack eyewitnesses or, if one is present, such witnesses have a bias towards the victim and may not be an objective source of truth.

In addition to eyewitnesses, the most affecting source of evidence comes from video or audio recordings of the event. In this case, security cameras caught the entire interaction between the two individuals. This allowed the police a straightforward view into the factual events. Security footage may not reveal verbal evidence, but in this case the attacker claimed the victim first assaulted him by grabbing his crotch. This was quickly disproven by the video evidence.

Police found the victim lying on the ground where the assault occurred, and he was taken to the hospital. Immediately going to the hospital is a powerful indicator of legitimate injury also, as it does not allow for staging or exaggeration of events.

Again, the victim had multiple witnesses to his injuries and was evaluated by medical professionals rather than taking a bloody selfie and posting it on social media or waiting until later to go to the hospital. The police were informed by a third party, in this case the security guard, and allowed the facts to be objectively recorded without outside influence. The first person to interact with the victim post-attack was the police officer, which significantly strengthens the case.

One of the most revealing aspects of this case is the pride the attacker took in his actions. He posted pictures of himself immediately afterwards, positioning himself as the victim and bragging about severely beating the man. He clearly intended for the public to know his motivations and felt justified in his actions.

A widely overlooked aspect in the narrative about a hateful population intentionally targeting minorities for violence is that we rarely see attackers bragging about their actions. It would seem reasonable that if people truly despise LGBT people to such an extent that they feel compelled to physically attack them in public, there would be more public celebration of such attacks.

Perpetrator Motives and Victim Reaction

A Texas study of hate crimes found that most reported hate crimes never identify a suspect and many are dismissed due to little or no evidence. It seems that the media assumes perpetrators of hate crimes simply wish to attack individuals of hated groups for the satisfaction alone rather than as a (perceived) political or social message.

In this case, the victim did admit to the police to propositioning the attacker. While a wildly inappropriate response, it is at least a reason that explains the attack. Too often we are simply asked to believe random citizens roam the streets looking for members of marginalized groups to assault for the sheer joy of the act.

Another unique property of this crime is that it took several months to collect sufficient evidence to properly prosecute the attacker with local reports updating the case. Too often, hate crimes receive a large, public announcement and rarely involve resolution or follow-up. This case was reported locally and in several LGBT news sources, but never achieved nationwide attention or outrage. This allowed the police and prosecution to gather evidence and build a case.

One overlooked quality of this case that significantly distinguishes it from most reported hate crimes is that the victim is not publicly named. Typically, an alleged victim immediately turns to social media or the press and tells his or her story before any investigation can be conducted.

In this case, even though he was viciously beaten over a minor infraction, he chose not to take this route. He was attacked, went to the hospital, gave an honest police report, and allowed justice to be properly served as he healed and rebuilt his life. While he deserves public sympathy for the attack, he did not seek fame or money. This says a great deal about the legitimacy of the incident.

Would Extra Laws Really Deter Hate Crimes? Not Likely

This was a hate crime because the attacker reacted to the proposition with extreme violence and bragged about attacking the victim, a gay man. The gay man took a chance in a moment of weakness late at night in a bar, and did not deserve to be viciously beaten. But an important question is: what law would have prevented this attack?

Although a terrible situation and unfortunate experience of engaging with the wrong person in the wrong scenario, the assault on its own was already illegal. Although a hate crime charge increases sentencing, is this going to influence Wiley’s future choices or his views on gay men or his own sexuality, which inspired the assault to begin with? Will the hate crime charges prevent a similar irrational young man from doing the same?

One of the unfortunate rhetorical media reactions, especially in LGBT advocacy, is the outrage that the violent incident occurred in the first place. They insist the same could happen to all LGBT people nationwide, and that the incident is evidence of a larger pattern. But this situation is far more of an outlier than a pattern. In fact, it’s the bold honesty of the attacker about his motivations that makes this story stand out as shocking and disturbing. Our collective agreement that this is morally wrong should be evidence enough that no one supports violence against LGBT people.

It is equally as important to recognize legitimate hate crimes as it is to report on the abuse of public sympathy and compassion with high-profile hoaxes. We should recognize that, despite the unfair imbalance of hoaxes to legitimate crimes, the police take reports seriously and do everything in their power to get justice for victims.

Unfortunately, it takes a real hate crime with a satisfying resolution for us to appreciate just how safe and protected LGBT individuals are in our society. The police and our justice system should be thanked for this.

Why The So-Called Equality Act Is A Bait-and-Switch Power Grab,"Let’s place ourselves, for a moment, into the mindset of a statist. If you and your cronies wanted to control everybody’s lives, how exactly would you go about getting such raw power? Obviously, you wouldn’t come right out and say you have a special project designed specifically to cement a permanent one-party state.

You wouldn’t explain, full disclosure, that the ever-growing bureaucracy you have in mind would promote a surveillance state and coercion that produces toxic levels of social distrust. You wouldn’t clarify that the point is to keep tabs on everyone in every aspect of their lives, including their education, their businesses, their medicine, their housing, their families, and their churches.

No, of course not. You would mask your self-supremacist intentions with a benign and trendy word like “equality.” You’d pretend that your project was about helping a vulnerable minority. To prevent scrutiny, you’d quickly shame anybody who had a question about it and defame them as haters. At the same time, you’d give special favors to those who can be persuaded to support your con job.

That’s usually how such things are done, as the history of authoritarian systems proves.

Sowing a Colossal Inequality of Power

So we have the “Equality” Act, recently introduced by Democrats in Congress. It’s currently being considered in various committee hearings and is on track for a floor vote in the House of Representatives later this spring or early this summer.

On the surface, the “Equality” Act is supposed to protect LGBT folks from discrimination by adding the categories of sexual orientation and gender identity to all federal civil rights laws, including the 1964 Civil Rights Act. It would make claims of discrimination related to these characteristics legally actionable in the way racism is, and aapplying to virtually every area of life: the workplace, education, banking, jury service, federal funding, housing, medicine and psychiatry, and all public facilities.

It is a power grab in the guise of anti-discrimination. A bait-and-switch. It’s another attempt by a ruling micro-clique to exert mega-control over everyone else’s lives, including those it purports to protect. It allows the Mass State to maximize bureaucracy and social engineering, especially by its huge regulation of speech and expression. It erodes individual rights while claiming to uphold them.

Sane people of goodwill have a host of good reasons to object to the so-called Equality Act. And many of those reasons have been written up, including the de-sexing of toilets and showers, the compelled speech inherent in pronoun protocols and severe punishment for “misgendering,” the promised harassment of business owners, the invasion of girls’ and women’s sports by biological men who force on them an unequal playing field, the utter contempt for individual conscience, and more.

The net result of this act would be a huge inequality of power accrued to the state and drained from the individual. Below I offer five general reasons to object to this legislation.

I think they give us a more macro view of how it would destabilize a free society, by 1) undermining the First Amendment; 2) threatening the rule of law; 3) nudging us towards a social credit system; 4) redefining humanity; and 5) enshrining identity politics in law. In short, the “Equality” Act doesn’t really protect anybody. It undermines human freedom and dignity by legally stripping Americans across the board of inalienable rights.

1. It Undermines Everyone’s First Amendment Rights

Our First Amendment freedoms of religion, speech, press, and association are clearly targeted by the “Equality” Act. It explicitly invalidates the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act so that anybody caught in this bill’s legal web is pre-emptively stripped of the right to express his or her conscience without loss of liberty and property.

So the mask is off. All prior promises of conscience clauses in past incarnations of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) laws are hereby exposed as bait intended only to push through bad laws until conscience protections could be abolished.

This act would suspend the right to free expression in secular daily life. There can be no question that it will lead to compelled speech. One huge hint is the 2015 New York law that compels speech by slapping a fine of up to $250,000 for the crime of using a sex-matched pronoun on someone who doesn’t want that. Federal law would take a page from Twitter, which suspends the accounts of users who are viewed as not compliant with transgender politics.

Freedom of association would also take a big hit. With its emphases on perceptions of gender identity (both self-perception and one’s perceptions of gender identity), a defendant who may have been perceived to raise an eyebrow can be threatened with loss of livelihood and even jail time. It’s bound to sow social distrust and a fear of guilt by association with a defendant.

It will also have huge repercussions for freedom of association. As I’ll note below, the Equality Act would erase sex distinctions in law, which means open war on family relationships. We’ve already seen a court removing of parental custody of a minor child identifying as transgender for refusing to have their child injected with powerful hormones.

It also places Big Brother into the therapist’s office by banning any sort of talk therapy that might lead to a patient undoing a transgender decision or going from gay to straight, even if the patient wanted to do so. This one-way street goes under the moniker “conversion therapy,” which the “Equality” Act explicitly bans.

Nevermind that there are already plenty of laws against coercion and medical malpractice on the books. A ban on so-called conversion therapy uses a few cases of malpractice essentially to ban open conversations with a cognitive therapist. This is not the sort of law a free people seek. It is reminiscent, however, of the sort of law cult leaders have always sought to prevent people from leaving the cult.

2. The Ambiguities in the Bill Threaten the Rule of Law

The first thing that should hit any reader of the so-called Equality Act is the ambiguity of its language, especially with the bill’s outright emphasis throughout on “perceptions.”

We should ask ourselves: How does the rule of law survive such intangibles? The bill is set up to pass harsh judgments on how people are perceived or how people perceive things. Such haziness is guaranteed to create wide latitude for an arbitrary system of punishment and rewards, with no regard for (or even much possibility for) due process.

It would have to calculate your intent, read your mind, check out your body language, pick you apart for any suggestion of malice.

It injects into numerous federal anti-discrimination laws, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a new protected class that is defined not by an immutable and noticeable characteristic like race and sex, nor of a person’s religious beliefs, which are inherent to First Amendment protections.

Instead, the newly injected category is “LGBT,” which refers to an entire panoply of personal relationships, social activities, attitudes, and various feelings of identity that can change from day to day. Granted, LGBT activists have succeeded in getting numerous state and local SOGI laws on the books. But a blanket fiat on the federal level is certain to open wider floodgates of abuse in interpreting and punishing any perception of discrimination, real or imagined.

Consider how much the “Equality” Act would rely on bureaucratic and court actors to divine the “perception” of the perpetrator or victim of so-called discrimination: it would have to calculate your intent, read your mind, check out your body language, pick you apart for any suggestion of malice. For example, it repeatedly refers to sexual orientation and gender identity as “actual or perceived.” Many times throughout, the text notes that discrimination (or identity?) involves “perception or belief even if inaccurate” (emphasis mine).

This dependence on perception or belief about a person’s self-identity did not exist before. The language of this proposed law is more fluid than gender fluidity on steroids, and it’s wild stuff to push, especially at the federal level. It invites no end of accusations and lawfare that bodes ill for society and promises much human wreckage. The only people “empowered” by such a scam are those on the upper levels of this newly devised food chain who can call the shots.

3. Nudge Toward a Chinese-style Social Credit System

If passed, we shouldn’t be surprised if it eventually produces a social credit system not unlike what is happening in China, whereby your livelihood, education, career, mobility, and access to goods and services is based on a literal “score” of your compliance with government policy. To paraphrase Sir Richard Scruton’s excellent observation of how that works in China, I’d say that the so-called Equality Act would help create robots out of Americans, with the state programming what they can say and do.

As more people self-censor because of the risk of losing their livelihoods and social status, they simply become more prone to robotic compliance and conformity with limits on their speech. This is fast becoming the case in China, where citizens feel the need to build up their “social credit” to be allowed access to jobs, education, housing, and who knows what other goods and services. The so-called Equality Act’s restrictions on First Amendment freedoms would be a big step in that direction.

A social credit system that scores you for conformity would be a logical effect of the intent of the Equality Act: to punish free expression in just about every sphere of life, including the workplace, at school, in the public square, and in all public facilities, and any place that might be connected with federal funding. (By the way, Scruton was punished—stripped of his chairmanship of an architectural commission in Britain—simply for explaining what the social credit system does to people in China. That should be another lesson for us here.)

4. Redefining Humanity By Outlawing Sex Distinctions

The “Equality” Act is de-humanizing because it essentially de-sexes all of us in law. It does so in two ways. First, it abolishes the legal definition of sex as a physical reality by incorporating both sexual orientation and gender identity—which means your perception of your sex—into its very definition of sex. Wherever the term “sex” appears in federal anti-discrimination law, the so-called Equality Act parenthetically adds the words “including gender identity and sexual orientation.”

Eliminating sex distinctions in law is the most effective path to abolishing state recognition of biological familial relationships.

Second, the act embeds a premise into its definition of gender identity that tells every American that his or her physical sex should not be legally recognized as real. Here’s its definition: “The term ‘gender identity’ means the gender-related identity, appearance, mannerism, or other gender-related characteristics of an individual, regardless of the individual’s designated sex at birth.”

The key phrase here is “regardless of the individual’s designated sex at birth,” which means that genitalia, or any distinction between male and female, would be irrelevant to any legal definition of sex. Many SOGI laws use the phrase “sex assigned at birth.” Either way, the premise is the same: physical reality has nothing to do with your maleness or femaleness.

This premise would apply to everybody universally, not merely those who choose to believe in a gender spectrum. More jurisdictions like Oregon are allowing people to opt out of sex distinctions altogether on official identification. With such laws, your sexual identity is deemed to be all in your mind, even if your perception is aligned with physical reality. So your sexed body essentially becomes unrecognized in law.

We should note that eliminating sex distinctions in law is the most effective path to abolishing state recognition of biological familial relationships. Once we no longer recognize male and female as distinct legal identities, any family relationships based on those distinctions—mother or father, son or daughter, husband or wife—fade away.

5. It Enshrines Socially Destructive Identity Politics

The so-called Equality Act depends entirely on a spirit of resentment embedded in identity politics. Identity politics can be summed up as the belief that your worth as an individual depends on your politically correct victim status.

Identity politics have been a plague on the nation, dividing and pigeon-holing everyone.

Increasingly, it relies on the concept of “intersectionality,” which scores your status according to which groups you belong to by race, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, and so on. If you are perceived as “white” and heterosexual, for example, gurus of identity politics will deem you guilty of “white privilege” in an effort to smear you and cut your voice off from public discourse.

Those who push identity politics rely heavily on promoting stereotypes and caricatures of people with no interest in getting to know people as individuals. Thus identity politics have been a plague on the nation, dividing and pigeon-holing everyone instead of allowing citizens to aspire to live happily as unique individuals with unique personalities.

This erases the intrinsic worth and dignity we all have as human beings. The regime of identity politics doesn’t allow people to interact freely with one another, which would allow us to achieve the sort of social balance we would need in order to optimize social harmony.

If members of Congress succumb to the toxins of identity politics by passing this act, they will have done enormous damage to the health of American society. In the end, it means that our worth would be assigned to us by the state, as is done in all authoritarian systems.

The Mass State Decides What Equality Means

The reasons I list above all come down to one trenchant point worth repeating yet again: this proposed law is a thinly veiled power grab by statists. The LGBT demographic is simply the victim group used as their pawn, their vehicle, the means to that end.

For the moment, people who identify as LGBT might seem protected by it, but if enacted, the law is designed to generate a hydra-headed monster of the Mass State that will take on a chaotic life of its own. It’ll mete out “protections” by whim. In the end, it just won’t protect anybody.

That’s because those running the show won’t be concerned about anything but maintaining the unchecked power that measures such as this ambiguously worded bill would bestow upon them. Any bureaucrat or judge can simply cherry pick from the act’s wording to decide whether you qualify as “equal, unequal, or something else.”

George Orwell’s novel “Animal Farm” included the maxim that “some animals are more equal than others.” Along with the 1984 slogan “Slavery is Freedom,” Orwell could easily have predicted the “Equality Act.” It’s a weird new world.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/22/called-equality-act-bait-switch-power-grab/,2019-04-22
Why I Refuse To Attend My College’s LGBT Graduation Ceremony,"LGBT icon Ellen DeGeneres once mused, “Do we have to know who’s gay and who’s straight? Can’t we just love everybody and judge them by the car they drive?” This was obviously a joke, but it contained a kernel of wisdom.

After coming of age in a time of gay oppression, with her show canceled after she came out as lesbian, DeGeneres knew that the full potential of American values could never be realized until all people, regardless of sexual orientation, were treated alike. So in a fair world, this means sexuality should be irrelevant to a student’s education.

Many modern campus progressives reject that vision. I recently realized just how far the LGBT left has strayed from this egalitarian mentality when I received a curious invitation from administrators at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, from which I’m set to graduate this May. The note invited me, a gay man, to attend a special “Rainbow Graduation,” an event supposedly “hosted every year to honor our graduating seniors within the LGBTQ community.”

I wasn’t flattered to receive this invitation, I was mortified. Self-segregated celebrations are the exact opposite of the egalitarian vision of gay rights I believe in, where all Americans ought to be treated the same, with sexual orientation little more than a footnote in our public life. Yet identity politics ideology has become so pervasive on college campuses and the progressive elite that they’re blinded to the individualism gay advocates once stood for. Now, they champion regressive groupthink.

How else could one possibly justify such a spectacle? The annual event regularly features keynote LGBT speakers, and is attended by LGBT students and their guests. Additionally, awards are given out to LGBT student leaders, sympathetic staff, and program participants. Interestingly, a “Spectrum” award is given to a student deemed most influential within the self-segregated LGBT residential community on campus.

These types of events send a chilling message about how progressives view LGBT students. Are we incapable of standing out from the student body on our own merits, rather than our sexual proclivities? What’s more, it reinforces the odd notion that sexuality alone is worth celebrating. No one should face discrimination or violence for his identity, but we also shouldn’t act like the sheer act of being gay is an accomplishment. It really isn’t, even if some people still do have to overcome additional obstacles due to their orientation.

And it’s not as if the modern university is such a homophobic, repressive place that students need solace to enjoy a graduation ceremony. The intention may be to provide “safe space” for LGBT people to celebrate, but in reality there is almost nowhere in the world safer or more accepting for gay people than an ultra-left campuses like UMass. In the absence of any real necessity, such a spectacle seems performative, not productive, like just another liberal attempt to cultivate the victim status that has become the new campus currency.

But it’s a stunt that could have real consequences. This type of approach sets gay people back, because actual acceptance comes through assimilation. These kinds of events, decorated with rainbows and featuring controversial progressive speakers, only make gay students stick out like a sore thumb. But LGBT students are your neighbor in the dorm room next door, the classmate you borrowed a pen from, or the TA who taught your freshman seminar—and you might never know it. That’s, frankly, how it should be.

Efforts to make a spectacle out of sexuality, which should really be irrelevant in an education setting, only set assimilation efforts back. This is a recipe for failure. After all, the most effective arguments for gay marriage were made in the court of public opinion not by railing against the traditional institution, but through framing same-sex marriage through the lens of widening a venerable social norm to include more everyday Americans. Ultimately, this was successful.

Yet the developing strain of identitarianism consuming the advocacy class threatens this progress. It has the potential to further polarize LGBT issues and ostracize LGBT people from American life, when what we really should do is attempt to spread a message of mutual tolerance. In their effort to pursue equality, progressives may set us all back.

The “Rainbow” graduation at UMass isn’t some one-off event. Rather, it’s emblematic of a nationwide trend: Colleges around the country have special LGBT student centers, graduation ceremonies, and even self-segregated LGBT dorms. Unfortunately, I don’t know how to solve this backwardness, but I do know that even DeGeneres wouldn’t dare call it progressive.

"No, It’s Not Bigoted For Lawmakers To Ban Child Drag Queens","Child exploitation should not be controversial, yet to the modern LGBT left it seems to be a subjective matter depending on what political or social narrative they want to pursue. Child drag queens appear to be a growing trend after the success of Desmond Napoles, who has been in the public eye since he was nine years old.

While many oppose the idea of minors performing drag at all, it shouldn’t be considered a “conservative” position to oppose them performing drag in adult bars. Drag is inherently sexual in nature. The origin and purpose of drag is to indulge adult humor through exaggerated female impersonation.

Some celebrate drag queens, and rightly so. They provide a unique sense of humor that is often playful, sassy, and so bluntly honest as to be enjoyable to many. But we should all agree it just isn’t for kids.

It’s Not Just Dress-Up, It’s Also Sexual Dancing

LGBT advocates of child drag performers insist it’s just children playing dress-up, as the mother of a nine-year-old performer stated recently: “Jacob is just a guy who likes to dress up and dance and feel pretty… it’s kind of like Halloween every time he has the opportunity to do it.”

It can certainly be argued there is a fine line between a boy dressing-up to “feel pretty” and that same boy dressing in a way that mimics a highly sexualized adult entertainment style. Pretending that there is no distinction is simply avoiding the truth of what is actually being done, even if everyone involved has innocent intentions.

I have no doubt the adults encouraging these kids are doing so out of a sense of openness and a kind nature. I equally do not believe the vast majority of adults cheering inside a bar as the child performs have any malicious motivations. But the sexualized nature cannot be ignored.

Recently, the LGBT site Pink News published a fairly startling headline: “Republican lawmakers want to make child drag shows illegal.” Strangely, this is portrayed as an act of anti-LGBT puritanism by ignorant and malicious Republicans. The article states, “Republican lawmakers in Ohio have filed a bill that would clamp down on drag performances by minors as ‘child exploitation.’”

The writer validates his suspicions by noting House Bill 180, “Prohibit performance in which child simulates sexual activity,” is co-sponsored by other Republicans with a history of anti-LGBT positions. The specific bill language the writer and LGBT advocates oppose states an illegal performance would include one “that suggests a minor is participating or engaging in sexual activity, masturbation, or bestiality and that, taken as a whole by the average person applying contemporary community standards, appeals to prurient interest.”

Jacob’s mother insists she does not allow her son to dance to songs with sexual lyrics and that she attends and monitors his performances. But the photo included in the article portrays the boy dressed in clearly provocative clothing and dancing in a way that should raise an eyebrow for any reasonable person.

Kids Can Be Exploited With Their Clothes On

Being far too literal, the writer argues the child was not specifically engaging in “sexual activity, masturbation or bestiality.” Shockingly, the mayor of Lancaster, Ohio stated in response to the concerns about the performance he had seen online that the boy “was fully clothed and was not touched by anyone in the audience.”

It should be clear to anyone objectively viewing this that the standard of concern should not be ruling out actual sexual activity or adults touching the child during the performance. The article quotes LGBT+ campaigner Kristen Angelo saying, “There is nothing wrong with what Jacob is doing. Nothing sexual, nothing inappropriate.”

The story first gained local attention when a video of a performance of the boy in a gay bar was shared on Facebook: “The story was then picked up by various religious and conservative websites. Critics of a video shared online objected to the boy’s costume, which included a leotard and wig, dance moves characterized as sexual in nature, and that the boy can be seen accepting money from bar patrons during the performance.”

Defending her choice to allow her son to perform in gay bars, Jacob’s mother said, “Where else is there right now for children who identify as being in the LGBT community to explore that interest? There’s not.” Young musicians often perform in bars at the same time of night, she said: “The difference is a lack of wig and heels.”

But that is the point here. Nine-year-old musicians are not performing to drunken audiences in adults-only bars. The difference is far more than just a “wig and heels.”

LGBT Contingent Appears to See No Problem

City police found no violations of state law or city ordinances, and the mayor stated, “The owners and managers of JD Hendersons [bar in question] did not approve of or condone this activity. Upon learning of this performance, the owners quickly condemned the show and banned this troupe of performers from returning to the establishment.”

He continued, “There have been serious threats of violence resulting from this post. Let us hope and pray that no harm comes to person or property as a result of it.” Jacob’s mother claimed to have received death threats and visits from local child protective services.

In a positive direction, State Sen. Teresa Fedor (D.-Toledo), who supports the proposed bill, said of the issue, “When we’re trying to prevent human trafficking from happening, especially the commercial, sexual exploitation of children, I don’t see how this is not very closely related to that issue — that concept of a rape culture where we’re normalizing this type of activity.”

Fedor is correct. A drag performance involves the entertainer typically lip-syncing to a song, dancing as provocatively as possible, and accepting “tips” from the audience during the performance. Many incorporate adult humor into their acts, which audiences loudly celebrate. It is intended to be adult entertainment.

Create Kid Spaces Instead of Exposing Adult Behavior

Jacob’s mother is correct in one area of this discussion, and that is young boys interested in dressing up, dancing, and singing to their favorite female performers and entertaining an audience should have a safe and child-friendly environment to do so. There is no reason LGBT leaders cannot launch a child-friendly performance space to perform in front of other children, parents, and local supporters without incorporating the adult aspects of drag culture. There is no justifiable reason for a nine-year-old to dance on stage in front of drunk adults, accepting money, and being encouraged to mimic adult entertainers.

There is no reason LGBT leaders cannot launch a child-friendly performance space.

The core of the issue is that anyone who views this from the outside clearly sees the problem. We do not see innocent dress-up dance parties, as portrayed by LGBT media. We see dark rooms, a stage surrounded by adult men, and a young boy dressed as a miniature adult woman parading around as the men toss money on stage. The only way LGBT activists can respond is to dismiss the concerns altogether or misrepresent what we can clearly see happening.

The exploitation of the child is in the environment and the portrayal. Adults who do prey on children have easy access to these venues, and normalizing this behavior allows young boys with less protective parents to be highly vulnerable. The very nature of the LGBT argument is to suggest the child should be able to freely indulge his or her gender expression and sexuality regardless of what other adults think is best for their safety.

LGBT advocacy does not benefit from stubbornly pretending there is nothing of concern with this activity. LGBT leadership has an opportunity to step up and advocate creative and free gender expression by providing a safe and transparent space for it to occur. While we can disagree on the appropriateness of parents allowing young boys to cross-dress in this fashion, we should all agree it should not be happening at night in a gay bar.

The sponsors of this bill recognize, as state Rep. Tim Schaffer (R-Lancaster) stated perfectly, “Given our heightened focus on human trafficking and the role money plays in trafficking children, I knew I had to take action to make sure this activity does not occur again. We can do better to protect innocent children and we must do better.”

I agree with him and it’s not the sole view of bigots or religious extremists. The average person would easily be able to distinguish why this is such an important and distressing concern. Unfortunately, LGBT activism, as it stands right now, refuses to do so.

"In Michigan, Obergefell's Next Domino Hits Christian Adoption Agencies","Sued by the American Civil Liberties Union and two homosexual couples for deciding not to place orphans with same-sex couples, Bethany Christian Services was forced to change its policy in a settlement. No longer will they refer these couples to other non-religious organizations, but they must comply with the state’s rules since they are under contract.

Like Michigan’s attorney general, a lesbian and former gay issues activist, most people will celebrate this as real progress. In their mind, Christian charities are only using their religion as a cover for bigotry. If they can compel these organizations to eliminate this supposed hate and continue offering social work, it’s a win-win: LGBT people and the state government are vindicated, and the charity will continue serving children instead of shutting down, as they did in Philadelphia when the city banned Catholic adoption agencies for declining to place children with gay and unmarried couples.

Those who see matters from the Christian perspective will rightly lament this development. Not only does it mark a major setback for religious freedom, but it further enables anti-Christian groups to go after other Christian charities.

Following the logic of the Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges, they can claim that Christian sexual morality discriminates against LGBT couples, and any person, organization, or business who abides by this morality is violating the law of the land. If religious freedom exemptions exist, the government can still cancel their contracts and virtually ban Christian charities from working in local communities.

A Sorry Loss of Assistance for the Most Vulnerable

Facing this hostility and loss of freedom, many Christian charities will stop providing services, leaving many people without assistance and reinforcing an American legal system that makes abortion far easier and cheaper than adoption. LGBT activists evidently see themselves as the real victims in this case, not the abused and neglected children in need of a home.

By forcing all charities to conform to their values, they bring about more harm than reform. One can only wonder how much more good could be done if these groups devoted their time, energy, and resources to offering services to those in need instead of trying to destroy religious organizations in court.

Those who don’t understand Christianity—which includes far too many on the left—like to maintain that Christians can just change their stance on sexuality without any problems. They think it’s only a matter of eliminating an irrational prejudice against a certain group of people. If Christianity is all about love, and gay people love one another, can Christians really argue against gay couples adopting children? Times have changed, and so should morality. This seems like an easy enough change to make.

Except that it isn’t. Christ makes it crystal clear that marriage is a sacrament between a man and a woman, not a term for people who really love each other and seek legal recognition. Furthermore, God the Father makes it crystal clear that homosexual activity is a sin. What is also crystal clear is that God—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—commands people to love sinners and those in need (in other words, everyone) and not to foster any kind of hate. Hence the preponderance of Christians in charitable projects.

Which Teachings of Christ Can We Ignore? None of Them

When anyone asks Christians to tweak their theology to be more inclusive and ignore certain teachings, they are really asking them to change their whole faith. If God the Father or God the Son were wrong about marriage or homosexuality, what else are they wrong about?

If charity only means “being inclusive” instead of seeking the good of others, then maybe doing nothing and posting rainbow flags on social media is the most charitable thing a person can do. And if seeking the good is still important, is it really that good to give a child to a couple potentially unfit for parenthood? If loving one’s neighbors equates to letting them do whatever they want and refusing to judge, why does the Bible include so many judgments and rules?

If gay couples are essentially the same as straight couples in their relationship and capacity to care for children, why does God, who created the universe, not allow people of the same sex to create children naturally? Finally, is it wise to encourage Christians to define themselves by their sexuality rather than their relationship with God?

With so many issues raised by defining love and marriage differently, any Christian organization that compromises on this question necessarily forfeits its Christian identity. Bethany Christian Services now serves Michigan; it does not serve Christ. It has transformed from a Christian charity into another social service subsidized by the state and a dwindling pool of private donors.

Over time, Bethany Christian Services will go the way of other charities subverted by government and progressive activists—it will lose support among actual Christians, become thoroughly secularized, and end up perpetuating the problems it was originally designed to combat. Saturated with secular values, it will promote the behaviors and attitudes that lead to unparented children and abusive adults and discourage the virtues that empower family life.

Since it already compromised itself once, it will continue to do so, favoring fundraising and a public image over actually helping victims. Meanwhile, it will become less effective and more corrupt. This is how so many Catholic charities today end up distributing contraceptives, facilitating abortions, lobbying for open borders, endorsing anti-Christian ideologies like socialism, laundering money, and of course, embezzling countless millions of dollars.

These charities, thankfully, represent a minority among the many good charities that hold fast to Christian doctrine, but they harm Catholic culture as a whole. While there are many priests (and bishops) ready to denounce intolerance, lacking compassion, stressing over orthodoxy, or being miserly and uncharitable, there are very few priests (and almost no bishops) willing to preach against abortion, divorce, addiction, or respecting the laws and customs of a country. In all too many cases, they are accomplices or enablers of these sins.

One might attribute these scandals to the Catholic Church’s large charitable reach. Being by far the largest charitable organization in the world for so many centuries, mixing with bad actors is unavoidable. Nevertheless, many of these problems stem directly from the church’s collaboration with the government. As soon as the government becomes a customer, it will always impose its values on the provider, no matter what rights the Constitution guarantees.

Occasionally, Catholic organizations will push back—again, imagine what the Little Sisters of the Poor and the Obama administration could have done with the millions wasted in litigation—but many of them swallow the poison pill of government funding and hope no one finds out.

A Certain Fate from Compromise

The consequence of a Christian charity changing its policies to match government-endorsed anti-religious views is not the possible outcome of a slippery slope; the decline is certain. When an organization compromises its values, it initiates a vicious sequence: without clear values or principles, the purpose becomes confused; a confused purpose then puts into question the identity of the organization; without an identity, the organization’s mission becomes incoherent and often counterproductive; and when this happens, those people who benefited from the organization are either neglected or actively harmed. This has been the fate of all too many liberal Christian churches that have adopted modern values prioritizing “inclusivity” and permissiveness over discipline and sacrifice.

The only way to prevent this sequence is for government and individuals to respect people’s beliefs and values in the first place. If someone wants to spread his values—Christian or not—through charity, he should do so by competing, not compelling. If the LGBT community wants to help gay couples adopt, they can start their own adoption agencies. If militant atheists want to indoctrinate kids with secular humanist values and hire liberal activists for teachers, they can build their own schools. If technocratic plutocrats want to provide contraceptives and iPads instead of food and medicine to starving families in the third world, they can do so without taxpayer or church assistance.

If any of these groups discriminate against Christians because serving them conflicts with their values or mission, they should be free to do so. And they should count on Christians to respond with their own charitable activity, and a limited, tolerant government to do nothing except uphold the law.

Not only would this reflect true social justice for all parties involved, but it would also lead to a healthy renewal of philanthropy in society and direct people’s efforts towards helping people in need. Charity starts with values, and safeguarding those values is the only way to safeguard charity.

"Gay Democrat Mocks, Harasses Christians For Praying On Sidewalk","Pennsylvania state Rep. Brian Sims is best known for responding to a visit from Vice President Mike Pence to his city by raising his middle finger and saying, “To be clear, we’re a City of soaring diversity…So keep that in mind while you’re here raising money to attack more families, spread more lies, blaspheme with your bible, and maybe even talk to a woman without your wife in the room.” He ended his post declaring, “So…get bent, then get out!”

LGBT media cheered on the display of “resistance” during gay pride month. Then, just a few days ago, Sims filmed himself berating an elderly woman who stood in front of Philadelphia’s Planned Parenthood quietly praying. In a tweet posting his video he said, “Push back against Planned Parenthood protestors, PLEASE! They prey on young women, they use white privilege, & shame. They’re racist, classist, bigots who NEED & DESERVE our righteous opposition. Push back, please! #YouAreStrongEnough.”

He then began recording the woman while asking his followers to donate $100 to Planned Parenthood for every hour she stood praying. He approached her and asked, “How many children have you clothed today? How many shoes have you put on children today? How many have you fed? Or have you spent all day standing outside Planned Parenthood shaming people for what they have a constitutional right to do?” The woman ignored him and continued praying.

For nine minutes Sims berated the woman with growing aggressiveness, calling her a “racist,” “disgusting,” and referring to her as an “old white lady” who is telling people what they can do with their bodies. As of this writing, the video has nearly 600,000 views.

Push back against Planned Parenthood protestors, PLEASE! They prey on young women, they use white privilege, & shame. They’re racist, classist, bigots who NEED & DESERVE our righteous opposition. Push back, please! #YouAreStrongEnough https://t.co/rYQOiAhC0D — Brian Sims (@BrianSimsPA) May 2, 2019

Writing for a local Philadelphia paper in response, Christine Flowers argues correctly, “I am extremely troubled by the fact that a man who is paid by our tax dollars feels it is appropriate to publicly shame one of those taxpayers just because he disagrees with her.”

In a previous video Sims approached four women praying outside the Planned Parenthood and told his followers he would give anyone who could identify them $100. He then berated the peaceful protesters as not being real Christians. They tried to explain their purpose, but he ignored them.

Repentance Is the Last Thing on Sims’s Mind

The pro-life organization Live Action posted the video to their followers saying, “WATCH: Pennsylvania State Representative @BrianSimsPA harasses an elderly woman who is peacefully advocating for the lives of preborn human beings and women who are considering abortion. This is shameful.” Sims responded, “Bring it, Bible Bullies! You are bigots, sexists, and misogynists and I see right through your fake morals and your broken values. #BeReal.”

After a great deal of backlash he defiantly posted, “‘Don’t discriminate against our discrimination. Don’t bully our bullies. Don’t hate our haters.’ – [P-ssy] Grabbers and Baby Cagers.” This has become a common response to overt bigotry from the left, especially within LGBT circles. They view any response to “bad” people as justified. This angry, aggressive, and abusive mindset drives much of LGBT advocacy today.

In an interview in April, Sims ironically said, “In my six years in government as a civil rights attorney, LGBTQ advocate, and activist, I learned one thing that I think makes for good government: it’s empathy. It sounds kind and sweet to hear a cis white man say that, but what I mean is the more the substance of empathy. Empathy is about putting yourself in somebody else’s shoes. And being a good legislator is about having the ability to do that.”

From those with Sim’s perspective, the world is divided into good and bad people and it is the responsibility of the good people to shame and shun the bad ones. When he sees an elderly lady praying quietly to herself, he sees what he believes to be an oppressive movement designed to harm others. He feels justified in hostility because he believes her very existence is hostile to others. He genuinely believes he is fighting for the right cause in the strongest way possible for people he views as vulnerable and attacked. He simply cannot imagine empathy for anyone he determines is a “bad” person.

This Will Obviously Backfire on Gay People

In 2018 after Sims won re-election, LGBTQ Nation gushed, “Sims, a liberal firebrand, is known for his nonstop advocacy for LGBTQ rights and his unique take on politics. He’s popular on social media and in queer media.” In another LGBT media profile, Queerty began an interview with the author musing, “Brian Sims reminds me of that older next-door neighbor gay kids might have had crushes on in elementary school: sexy and smart, and so friendly we almost didn’t feel like outcasts when we were in his presence. And like those guys, our imaginations would run to the impossible dream: If only a man like that could be gay.”

Sims’s aggressive and hostile interactions with anyone who challenges him, or whom he views as a “bigot,” is reminiscent of the early days of the gay rights movement. For many gay people, this in-your-face, open rage, and bullying is a sign of strength and progress.

While Sims may believe he is fighting for what is right and may indeed be helping a great many people, he does not realize, or possibly care, the damage he is doing to the movement. Unfortunately, none of the current generation of LGBT activists does.

Despite the glory of movies and historical revisionism of a heroic, rebellious LGBT movement, to most people these kinds of tactics come off as arrogant bullying. Angry protestors screaming insults and shouting profanity is not appealing to anyone outside of the movement. It is not a show of strength, and it is certainly not effective in winning people over. In truth, it is more likely to energize an otherwise tolerant population into opposition.

This Is Not How to Advocate for Gay Rights

What does it mean to be an LGBT rights advocate today? From what we see most often, it appears to require a great deal of anger, hostility, and self-righteous intolerance. This is not merely a biased opinion of political opponents, it just seems to be the way the left chooses to promote LGBT people in media.

It also appears to be a narrow generational mentality in current LGBT leadership. Last-generation LGBT advocates like Ellen DeGeneres and RuPaul embraced society’s curiosity and discomfort. They used humor, empathy, and personality to allow the broader population to wade in gently and get a good look around at what gay mainstream culture had to offer. Instead, today’s LGBT leaders are harsh, full of rage and indignation, and eager to start a fight and demonize their opponents.

LGBT advocacy today comes from a place of rage and hatred. It is built on the assumption that to achieve equality, advocates must break through the doors, intimidate the naysayers, and take over the loudspeakers. It is a movement of obnoxious lecturing, silencing, intimidation, bullying, and bitter rage that does little more than validate their prejudices.

It is undermining, with dynamite, the foundation Ellen and RuPaul built carefully just a few decades ago, and it is creating animosity in otherwise polite people. No one should praise an adult man for harassing an elderly woman or attempting to publicly humiliate and intimidate several women peacefully praying on the sidewalk, no matter how passionately he opposes their beliefs.

More importantly, our elected leaders should be held to a higher standard and should not harass citizens practicing their civil rights. If Sims’s driving goal is empathy, he needs to genuinely address his own deeply held bigotry and speak to those he disagrees with, not shout at and shame them on camera. If LGBT people want to keep the social acceptance they’ve fought so long for, they need to stop promoting such hateful voices as their leaders as well.

'Gender-Inclusive Puberty' Is The Latest Myth Peddled By Trans Activists,"Everyone knows that the biological process of maturation, puberty, differs for males and females. It’s nonsense to talk about puberty as if the sex of the person going through puberty is irrelevant.

But nonsense is what the activists at Gender Spectrum are peddling in their new publication, entitled “Principles of Gender-Inclusive Puberty and Health Education (‘Gender-Inclusive Puberty’).” It’s fake science, designed to further the LGBTQ agenda of Gender Spectrum and the six activist organizations behind the document: Planned Parenthood, Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS), Advocates for Youth, Answer, GLSEN, and the Human Rights Campaign.

“Gender-inclusive puberty education” is an invented term that conceals ideological hokum under language vaguely suggestive of fairness and science. It’s an activist-driven maneuver to embed the gender-identity construct into the minds of impressionable children—all children—under the guise of health education. The real goal is to normalize transgender and non-binary identities and the drastic medical and surgical interventions that “affirm” them.

If the so-called Equality Act becomes federal law, we can expect gender-inclusive puberty education to be taught in every public school in the country, under the guise of protecting trans students from discrimination. Even if the act fails, however, gender-inclusive puberty education won’t vanish: Activists already have embarked on classroom, district, and state efforts to bring fake science into classrooms quite openly, creating “queer- and trans-inclusive curriculum and classroom[s].”

They are leveraging the political power of big-time endorsers to pressure school districts into adopting this approach. Gender Spectrum cleverly promotes its document not as a “curriculum” (which typically requires approval) but as a set of “principles” that any teacher can use to transform existing health curricula into an LGBTQ-friendly experience.

What is gender-inclusive puberty education? It consists of five principles.

1. Gender Literacy for All

Gender activists insist that all children need a foundation in “gender literacy.” Imagine that. For thousands of years, pubescent teens the world over somehow managed to pass through puberty without being “gender literate.” Not so for today’s kids, who need gender literacy to grasp “the complexity of gender” since “gender is about more than bodies.”

At this point, one might reasonably ask, “What exactly is ‘gender’?” The Gender Spectrum document never defines it, noting only that “the vocabulary of gender continues to evolve and there is not universal agreement about the definitions of many terms.” Translation: Gender means what activists want it to mean.

Gender Spectrum suggests teachers impart gender literacy by telling their students: “We don’t know what someone’s gender is just by looking at them,” and “While many of us thought that genitals define our gender, our gender is richer and more complex than that.” The gender-literate child learns that “a person’s body, gender expression, and gender identity” each exist “on a spectrum,” and that gender and sexual orientation are different but “related aspects of a person’s identity.”

Teachers will portray “multiple non-binary gender identities” as normal, embraced “historically” by “many cultures across the globe.” (Historically? What, since last Tuesday?) Let’s be blunt: Gender literacy is code for gender indoctrination.

2. Bodies Follow Patterns, not Rules

Because trans activists repudiate the truth about our bodies—that human beings are either male or female, forever—they play words games and throw up linguistic smokescreens in order to manufacture doubt around basic biological facts. So it’s not surprising that the second principle of gender-inclusive puberty education rejects rules about bodies in favor of patterns, thus promoting the fiction of natural gender diversity.

Using scripted talking points, teachers reinforce the point that bodies need not conform to rules. They first highlight stereotypical “boy” or “girl” behaviors as patterns (not rules) of behavior, because stereotypes clearly don’t apply to everyone.

Next, they pivot from behaviors to bodies: Teachers present “intersex” conditions not as disorders of sexual development (in which the baby’s body, in utero, fails to develop properly as a male or female body) but as “natural” variations of sexed bodies. Ergo, human bodies reflect “tremendous physiological diversity that belies binary categories.” The pseudo-science of gender thus rejects the binary rule that babies must be either male or female.

Gender Spectrum suggests teachers explain it like this:

When a baby is born what’s the first question that often gets asked? Right—is it a boy or a girl? And how does that get decided? Right again—we look at their bodies. For example, if a baby has a penis they’re assigned the sex of male and it’s assumed they will identify as a boy. While that pattern is true for many people it is not true for everyone. For example, some people realize as they get older that the gender identity adults thought they were when they were born doesn’t fit who they know themselves to be. (Emphasis mine.)

Tossing aside the biological certainty of male and female, gender experts imagine that a person’s authentic identity emerges magically from a complex jumble of body parts, gender dimensions, and fluid feelings. No rules, just be who you are.

3. Puberty Happens to De-Sexed Body Parts

The third principle asserts that pubertal developmental is best described through a de-sexed lens. Teachers are taught to reference body parts and functions without acknowledging that the physiological changes of puberty are driven by the person’s biological sex. “On a basic level, this means describing the parts that different bodies come with (and their functions) as opposed to connecting those parts to a particular gender.”

The teacher might explain the “bodies, not people” approach like this:

For the most part when I talk about bodies I’ll talk about bodies with a penis and testicles or bodies with a vulva and ovaries. You might wonder why I’m doing this instead of just saying male bodies or female bodies. As we’ve discussed, there aren’t just two kinds of bodies. I also want everyone to get used to using accurate language for body parts and functions without assuming that there are only two sexes and that everyone within a particular sex is the same.(Emphasis mine.)

Without any trace of irony, the script concludes with, “It’s important to be able to communicate about our bodies in accurate ways.” The gender-inclusive script recommends using anatomical diagrams of human reproduction scrubbed of the words male and female. Explanations about the functions of specific body parts are detached from the sexual identity of the actual person going through puberty. Gender Spectrum tells teachers to point to the:

vagina and ovaries and simply say, ‘For those who have ovaries, the pituitary glands and ovaries interact to start menstruation.’ When looking at a diagram of a body with a penis and testicles, teachers may refer to the testicles and note that ‘Sperm cells are produced daily once puberty has begun.’

Here’s the problem: Gender-inclusive puberty education is fake science. It omits fundamental scientific facts, including that “puberty is by essence sexually dimorphic” and “puberty and sex critically influence brain maturation in adolescence.” Students are radically shortchanged when the reality of biological sex is excised from discussions about puberty: the real truth about who they are is hidden from them.

Why does gender-inclusive puberty education omit such fundamental truths? Because to succeed, the transgender agenda must brainwash our children into believing that their bodies have no meaning and can be modified at will. “Who they are” depends on subjective feelings.

4. Many Pathways to Adult Bodies

The fourth principle of gender-inclusive puberty aims to normalize transgender and non-binary identities and to frame the pursuit of cross-sex hormones and mutilating surgeries as perfectly normal paths to an “adult body.” Gender Spectrum asserts that “human bodies” reflect “tremendous diversity…[in] the way they grow and develop into adulthood.” The educator’s task is to “convey the range of experience people have in this maturation process” in order to “help every student see their path within a norm, including those that may require some form of medical or surgical support. Acknowledging the multiple pathways to an adult body is essential.”

Instructors introduce the idea of “multiple pathways to adult bodies” first by emphasizing the “natural variations” in physical development. Second, they tell students it’s not uncommon for young people to need “medical support” during puberty. The “big lie” falsely equates medical interventions to fix problems related to puberty (e.g., using puberty blockers to arrest premature puberty) with medical interventions to suppress normal pubertal development in “transgender young people”—a prelude to using cross-sex hormones to spur “pubertal development…consistent with their gender.”

Gender Spectrum suggests teachers explain that:

Puberty is the time of life when a child’s body begins developing into adult form. It looks very different for each person … Some young people will start puberty at such a young age that they may be given medication to slow down the process. Puberty can also be delayed. Some young people will experience puberty in a way that does not feel right for their gender and medication can be used to pause that process … Each body is different. (Emphasis mine.)

From the gender-inclusive perspective, a teen girl who takes puberty blockers and then testosterone is receiving “medical support” that affirms her chosen “pathway to an adult (masculine) body.” In truth, the gender-inclusive approach obscures biological reality by pretending that puberty has nothing to do with sexual identity. Worse, it downplays the radical nature of puberty-disrupting interventions that purport to fulfill trans desires for “gender congruence.”

5. Sterilizing Teens Is No Big Deal

Gender-inclusive puberty education not only aims to disrupt “cis-normative” and “hetero-normative” narratives about identity and sexuality but also to undermine the natural family, a married mother and father with children, by characterizing it as merely one “narrative of family building.” Gender Spectrum cautions teachers not to imply that “the sole reason bodies are changing is to produce children and create families” or that children are “born because a man and a woman have sexual intercourse in order to fertilize an egg.”

Instead, teachers should help students “embrace the array of family building options” including “egg donors and sperm donors, blended families, surrogacy, and adoption.” Why? Because it’s “critical” for “students whose sexuality or gender may leave them concerned that parenthood won’t be an option” to realize they “will have many options for creating their own family.”

In short, trans activists want confused kids to feel good about taking hormones that will render them infertile—before they are legally old enough to order a beer—because “just as there are many pathways to your adult body, there are also lots of ways of becoming a parent.”

Coming to a School Near You

Parents (and voters) need to face facts: Gender-inclusive puberty education is coming to a public school near you, if it hasn’t already. Before publishing this resource, Gender Spectrum promoted the concept in plenty of schools.

For example, the Sex Education Program Manager for Oakland, California, public schools praised Gender Spectrum’s training for teaching Oakland’s middle school science teachers to “talk about bodies without using gender.” Soon all schools in California will follow suit: the California Board of Education just approved the framework for statewide LGBTQ-inclusive sex education.

The public education establishment and the School-Based Health Alliance (networks of school-based health clinics) are all in for “gender-inclusive” puberty education. They are solidly backed by progressive heavy-hitters like the Southern Poverty Law Center, Planned Parenthood, and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation.

Public school parents may still have a fighting chance to push back against gender indoctrination masquerading as science, as long as this issue is contested locally—although the odds are not good. But if the so-called Equality Act passes, the odds that parents will be able to shield their children from LGBTQ indoctrination are exactly zero.

LGBT People Rage At Pete Buttigieg For Not Being Gay Enough,"Gay representation has certainly come a long way from Patrick Stewart and Steven Weber in the classic 1995 gay film, “Jeffrey.” That same year, Patrick Swayze, John Leguizamo, and Wesley Snipes shocked audiences with their hilarious and stunningly relatable performances as urban drag queens taking a long road trip across middle America in “To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar.”

And of course, who could forget Robin William’s heartfelt comedy performance in “The Birdcage”the following year? These movies were promises of societal acceptance as big-name, straight actors played proud gay characters for straight audiences who laughed, cheered, and empathized with them.

As acceptance and normalcy have rained out the gay pride parade and “coming out” no longer requires a party or the prospect of never speaking to one’s parents again, the appreciation for sharing LGBT culture has significantly dwindled. Where we once tearfully cheered on our straight allies, today we see LGBT writers and actors smugly lecturing them on the appropriate distance to keep between themselves and sacred artifacts of LGBT culture and identity.

If a straight actor plays a gay role today, the movie is likely to be boycotted by LGBT activists. If a gay actor plays a transgender role, the same can happen. Although we were once thrilled by mainstream representation, we now find LGBT people complaining that even the first openly gay candidate running for president just isn’t queer or diverse enough.

‘Heterosexuality Without Women’

In an essay featured in the Los Angeles Review of Books, writer Greta LaFleur provided the perfect illustration of where leftist identity evolution has brought the movement. The essay is titled, “Heterosexuality Without Women.” Analyzing the portrait of Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg and his husband standing in front of their home on the cover of Time, LaFleur laments, “This photo also tells a profound story about whiteness, above and beyond the fact that almost everything in this photo is, itself, white.”

While lingering on in the deeply confusing world of race-obsessed power theories so popular on the intersectional left—and struggling to precisely explain why she feels such an overwhelming discomfort with the Time magazine image—she finally comes to the conclusion, “The argument I am making, of course, is that this photo is about a lot of things, but one of its defining features is its heterosexuality. It’s offering us the promise that our first gay first family might actually be a straight one.” She even goes so far as to point out that the word “family” in the title of the headline is in bold, white letters.

The second aspect of her discomfort is represented by the idea that the “First Family” is appealing to the LGBT community in contrast to the reality that 1980s and ’90s conservatism was so greatly focused on protecting the family from gay culture. She writes, “The tulips; the Chinos; the notably charming but insistently generic porch; the awkwardly minimal touching that invokes the most uncomfortable, unfamiliar, culturally-heterosexual embrace any of us have ever received—offers a vision of heterosexuality without straight people.” Somehow a happily married gay couple is just a bit too comfortable for her.

The Daily Beast also noted this mindset is growing within the queer female community, beginning a recent piece with the premature conclusion, “But for some queer women, the primary star is just another white man running for president.” Ara Wilson, a professor at Duke University, bluntly told The Beast that her priority in electing the president did not include a young, white, gay man. She argued, “Simply put, living as a queer woman, a queer woman of color, or even a queer man of color, is markedly different than living as an educated, cisgender, well-dressed, white gay man.”

In a long tweet thread analyzing the situation, Steven W. Thrasher, a doctorate candidate at New York University, lamented that the word “gay” represents cisgender white homosexual men, while “queer” means everyone else. He began his argument, “Prediction regarding Peter Buttigieg: this candidacy will expose the major faultiness between white gay men and the rest of the LGBTQ community.”

Not Enough Intersectionality for Queer People?

His main contention revolves around his perception that only white gay men seem excited for Buttigieg, while the remaining members of the LGBT community show little support—many are even hostile to what he represents. There is a strong dislike for his race, his Christianity, his military service, and the fact that he is in a monogamous marriage, all things the writer associates with a “white, gay man.”

Despite Buttigieg acknowledging his lack of intersectional qualifications by saying, “I have no idea what it is like personally, what it is like to be a transgender woman of color, but I know that I need to stand up for her, just as others have stood up for me,” it seems inadequate to quell the criticism. Another queer lesbian woman remarked, “I do like that he’s an openly gay man running for president. But at the same time, I’m a black queer woman and sometimes it just gets a bit discouraging that the first person to open the way always has to be white.”

Christina Cauterucci, a writer at Slate, contends that because Buttigieg looks straight, is well-dressed, well-spoken, and has no overt flamboyance, he is unable to empathize with the hurdles other LGBT community members have to face. Jacob Bacharach of The Outline went a step further and demanded that Buttigieg is actually bad for the LGBT community.

Complaining, once again, that Buttigieg is white, educated, and boring, his main argument posits Buttigieg is far too conservative to adequately represent LGBT Americans. Aside from the common list of minority statuses Buttigieg lacks, Bacharach recoils at the idea of what Buttigieg and his husband portray to America—a clean, sexually monogamous, polite, financially secure, heteronormative stereotype. He seems uneasy that Buttigieg is not actively on the gay hook-up app Grindr, which he finds suspicious and offputting.

The Narrow Confines of Identity Politics

Long past are the days of “We are just like everyone else” and “We just want to be treated equally!” Today, it seems, the only thing that matters is what makes you different from everyone else. Unfortunately, identity politics defines this exclusively through skin color, gender identity, and class. Where the rainbow flag once represented the endless diversity of personal expression, with the explicit understanding that everyone in society is welcome, today it seems every individual is assigned a stripe and must never venture too far outside of its restrictions.

It is profoundly odd to me that, as a gay teenager in the late ’90s, my ideal social dream was exactly what Buttigieg represents to America today. But it seems it took us too long to grow up and the next generation has a new dream of their own, of which they do not seem as sure as we were. But they are very adamant about what they do not want.

What is progressive today will be unacceptably conservative tomorrow. Intersectional identity politics moves faster than society can keep up with. It is remarkably sad that we live in a time when a genuinely accomplished young politician can run for president and be popular based on his character, experience, and policy positions, while also being a gay married man. The left is too obsessed with his superficial characteristics to appreciate how wonderful this truly is.

We have become so normal as to be boring to young activists eager to wave their fists in the air for some revolutionary idea or another. And the end result of the long fight for gay rights and normalcy in America is the potential of the first openly gay married president in American history being dismissed for not being diverse enough for the current LGBT set.

"No, Three Recent Murders Weren’t Because The Victims Were Trans","All life is precious, and no human being has greater value than any other. When an innocent person is murdered, we all suffer from the loss of life, potential, and the love shared by that individual. It is especially cruel when the death is random or the consequence of the selfish, criminal actions of others who do not value life and freedom.

It is also cruel when a tragedy is exploited for political gain and individuals are used to advance a narrative that overshadows the lives they lived. Unfortunately, even when the intentions are just, the exploitation is nevertheless wrong.

Ashlee Marie Preston, a prominent transgender activist, illustrated how compassion and advocacy can often create unnecessary fear and outrage by tweeting, “3 black trans women have been murdered within a couple of days of one another. When we whisper, no one hears us. When we yell; we’re gaslighted, demonized, and told we’re being intense. This is a crisis. All across America; my sisters are being erased. Will you stand up for us?”

Echoing the sentiment, Human Rights Campaign declared, “It is clear that fatal violence disproportionately affects transgender women of color, and that the intersections of racism, sexism, homophobia, biphobia and transphobia conspire to deprive them of necessities to live and thrive. This epidemic of violence that disproportionately targets transgender people of color — particularly Black transgender women — must cease.”

A spokesperson for the LGBT advocacy organization Anti-Violence Project argued, “Without safety and access to the workforce, healthcare, housing, and other critical areas of public life, Black trans women continue to be made disposable and denied the most the basic necessities needed to live a full life.” The organization released a report in 2017 on anti-LGBT violence and concluded, “For the last five years, NCAVP has documented a consistent and steadily rising number of reports of homicides of transgender women of color, which continued into 2017.”

In a tweet identifying a transgender woman who was recently found murdered in Philadelphia, the LGBT legal advocacy organization Lambda Legal demanded, “Stop killing black trans women.”

Discussing this recent murder, the above linked Philadelphia paper cited a survey stating, “The National Center for Transgender Equality released a survey of 28,000 transgender people in 2015, in which nearly one in 10 respondents said they were physically attacked in the last year because of being transgender. Transgender women of color were four times as likely as other transgender people to have been attacked at gunpoint.”

Discussing the LGBT community’s concerns over the safety of holding a public memorial, one transgender person said, “I’m scared that someone might follow me home from a rally, that someone might follow me home from work. I’m in fear.”

There is, however, one significant issue concerning the three transgender people cited in the above outcries that illustrates a serious narrative flaw: none of them were murdered for being transgender.

Claire Legato, a 21-year-old transgender person, was shot on April 15 of this year and died from those injuries on May 14 in Cleveland, Ohio. Muhlaysia Booker, a 23-year-old transgender person, was shot and killed on May 18 of this year in Dallas, Texas. Michelle “Tamika” Washington, also known as Michelle Simone on social media, a 40-year-old transgender person, was shot and killed on May 19 of this year in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A

ll three are the subjects of ongoing criminal investigations, with two suspects under arrest. Muhlaysia Booker was previously involved in a viral video assault that occurred in mid-April.

According to police, Legato was at home with Legato’s mother and a man named John Booth. Legato’s mother was in an escalated argument with Booth, accusing him of stealing her tax refund check. During the altercation, Claire confronted Booth then left the house. Booth followed Claire and shot Claire in the head. Booth, 61, is charged with assault in connection with the shooting.

There is no indication the violence occurred due to Claire’s transgender identity or the relationship Claire and Claire’s mother had to Booth. Almost surely both knew of Claire’s transition. Claire, aged 21, was clearly in an incredibly unsafe environment that appears to have included domestic violence. A dispute over money and Booth’s willingness to use deadly force with a gun during an altercation tells us the danger Claire was living in. The shooting happened around 4 a.m.

Tamika Washington, according to police, was shot multiple times around 5 a.m. and died nearly a half hour later in the hospital. Washington’s alleged killer, Troy Bailey, 28, has been arrested and police believe the murder was the result of an attempted robbery, as neither individual knew each other. According to Philadelphia Gay News, Bailey has been charged with “murder, possession of a firearm with an altered manufacturer’s number and violations for carrying a firearm as a former convict and without a license, among other crime.” Washington was a well-known transgender person and LGBT activist.

Muhlaysia Booker is a unique case, having also been assaulted in a widely shared video showing a group of men viciously beating Booker. Booker accidentally backed into another car on the road and the driver drove Booker off the road in an attempt to prevent Booker from fleeing. According to the victim, the other driver pointed a gun at Booker and demanded Booker pay for the damage to his car before he would allow Booker to leave. A crowd gathered around the altercation, and an unidentified person offered Edward Dominic Thomas, 29, $200 to beat Booker.

The video of the incident shows the beating in progress as a large crowd shouts and cheers while surrounding them as multiple men violently attack Booker. Although Out Magazine indicated the video shows homophobic and misogynistic slurs being hurled from bystanders and Booker reported the attackers used homophobic slurs, this is not indicated clearly by the video or confirmed by police.

Thomas was arrested on April 15, 2019, and has a prior history of family assault, burglary, and the illegal carrying of a weapon. During an interview with police, he admitted to the assault but claimed not to have engaged in any derogatory language towards the victim. No other witnesses’ statements have been released or other arrests associated with the attack as of this writing.

The attack appears to be a highly escalated case of road rage and mob violence. There is no other evidence to indicate the attackers knew Booker, that Booker was transgender, or that the assault was motivated by Booker’s gender identity. At a rally after the first assault, Booker told the crowd, “This time I can stand before you,” alluding to the fact that when violence against black transgender people receives any kind of attention, it’s usually because that person has been killed: “In other scenarios, we are at a memorial.”

On May 19, several weeks later, around 6:40 a.m., Booker was found dead of gunshot wounds on a street. The police are currently investigating but have found no evidence to address if the murder was retaliatory or bias-motivated. There are no current suspects or witnesses to the crime.

All three of these tragedies appear to be either random violence or domestic violence, and this is indeed a vital concern for our society. A person should not fear being severely beaten over a minor car accident in broad daylight as a crowd cheers, nor should a person be the victim of a robbery walking along a street. A person should certainly feel safe in their own home with his or her family.

But these are dangers everyone faces in high-crime areas or even simply due to being in the wrong place at the wrong time. This is why conservatives advocate so strongly for gun rights and ownership as a powerful tool of personal protection. But to assume these tragedies are somehow connected by transgender identity or race is not only unsupported by the evidence, but also intentionally incites fear and paranoia in the name of innocent victims.

There is no evidence of targeted violence against transgender people of color or otherwise, and there is no evidence of a specific threat of LGBT individuals publicly gathering in a group or traveling alone on their daily business. To claim a specific pattern of violence due solely to shared characteristics of the murder victims is misleading and unethical. Worst of all, it causes members of those minority groups to feel their own sense of freedom and security must be restricted for no reason at all.

No new law, task force, or awareness campaign is going to be able to address these crimes if focused on the completely irrelevant personal and physical characteristics of the victims in this narrow case. To protect transgender women, or anyone else living in our vast country filled with diversity and various dangers and threats, we must embrace personal protection and personal responsibility in our daily actions.

Nothing good happens after 3 a.m., never engage with an angry person waving a gun at you, and always, always, be able to defend yourself and your family if a threat appears. This is good advice for everyone.

LGBT people don’t need special protections. We just need to be aware of the dangers around us.

Soccer Star Megan Rapinoe Uses Soccer To Push Her Politics,"United States Women’s National Soccer Team (USWNT) player Megan Rapinoe recently declared, “I’ll probably never put my hand over my heart. “I’ll probably never sing the national anthem again” (mphasis mine). Fewer than 30 days before the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup, where USWNT will defend their world title, it was only a matter of time before the elephant in the room revealed itself once again.

It started three years ago, at the height of the national anthem protests. In a show of solidarity with protest spearhead Colin Kaepernick, Rapinoe knelt during the national anthem before a match with her club team and, later, before an international match. After U.S. Soccer expressed its disapproval, Rapinoe ceased her protest, but no longer sings the anthem nor places her hand over her heart.

Then and now, Rapinoe expressed anger with the reaction to the protests, including hers. “I think it’s actually pretty disgusting the way [Kaepernick] was treated and the way that a lot of the media has covered it and made it about something that it absolutely isn’t,” she said in 2016. “We need to have a more thoughtful, two-sided conversation about racial issues in this country.”

Rapinoe is correct—a more thoughtful, two-sided conversation regarding just about every issue is needed in this country. Besides toxic rhetoric, there is a startling lack of good faith and dedication to reasoned argument that is either the product of a faltering civil society or a contributing factor to it.

But, as the saying goes, there’s a time and place for everything. The Women’s World Cup is a prime face of the USWNT and a de facto national emissary. Is this international athletic tournament that has grown grander in stature over the years the place to air grievances and express what can only be described as contempt for one’s country?

Rapinoe Needs to Consider the Effects of Her Choices

The choice is hers alone. But should she persist in being a “walking protest,” as Rapinoe describes herself, she would benefit her team and country to acknowledge the unfortunate and unnecessary distraction and divisive effects her actions pose.

Of course, if Rapinoe feels as strongly about her cause as she seems, she is not only free to protest but probably should. Americans should never be forced to choose between their conscience and their livelihood, nor be discouraged from taking part in the important conversations of the day. The nation doesn’t need less engagement from citizens, it needs more.

But the freedom to protest has been conflated with the constitutional right to protest. As many legal analysts pointed out, there’s no such thing as the latter. Paul Callan explained in 2017: “The First Amendment restricts only the government from abridging ‘the freedom of speech.’ Private employers can do as they please. Thus, kneeling during the National Anthem can never be legally prohibited by the government, but can always be prohibited by private employers.”

Nobody needs to indulge any player’s personal conduct. As a recent interview with ESPN President Jimmy Pitaro reveals, most fans believe athletics and politics shouldn’t mix.

Soccer’s Entry into the Culture War

In the case of U.S. Soccer and the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL), however, that ship may have already sailed. Both organizations became embroiled in the culture wars long before Rapinoe’s protests. Soccer in the United States has a strong LGBTQ following. U.S. Soccer celebrates Pride month every year and invests considerable time and money in LGBTQ-associated programs. More than any other sport in America, soccer has been at the forefront of ensuring LGBTQ people can partake in the game openly and have their interests represented.

A supporter of such gestures would counter by saying this isn’t about politics, but about acceptance, tolerance, and a constant reminder the game is open to all. But is it, really? In June 2017, fellow USWNT player Jaelene Hinkle discovered there isn’t a whole lot of room in professional soccer for those who aren’t in lockstep with the LGBTQ movement.

After being called up to the national team in June 2017, Hinkle, a devout Christian, withdrew herself from the roster, later citing personal opposition to wearing the rainbow-adorned jerseys celebrating Pride month. She faced tremendous backlash from fans and critics, who made a fair point about whether her views might cause issues in a LGBTQ-saturated sport—many players are open regarding their sexual orientation, which can generate controversy in other sports.

The point isn’t to judge Hinkle’s beliefs. It’s to show why so many Americans are wary of turning sports into yet another culture war battlefield. Hinkle’s views were virtually unknown prior to the June ’17 incident, and she didn’t divulge her reasons for her withdrawal until much later. Moreover, according to coaches and teammates, her “homophobic” views had never been an issue on the playing field.

Even her critics had no choice but to concede the Pride month flap had created an unfortunate dilemma where the USWNT would have to enter the World Cup without a player described by many as one of the best at her position. The culture wars’ effects on sports are undeniable—they impose ideological conformity in an arena where athletic ability and a willingness to represent one’s country should serve as the sole litmus test.

Nobody should be forced to choose between her conscience and her livelihood, but the culture wars often assess such a decision. Hinkle chose her conscience. Although she hasn’t expressed any regret, between her and Rapinoe, only one made such a choice, and it wasn’t the latter. More importantly, one player sacrificed a once-in-a-lifetime privilege due to her personal convictions, while the other insists on using that same privilege to essentially declare, “You’re either with me or against me.”

Rapinoe: Representing America?

Rapinoe will likely go down as one of the greatest soccer players in American history. She has been a key cog in the machine that has won three World Cups and is the clear favorite to win a fourth in 2019. It’s more reason why it’d be so unfortunate to see her as likely the only player in the entire tournament to draw such a stark line in the sand between herself and her country.

While Rapinoe insists her protest is about “representing all of America,” how exactly does a protest represent her country in any capacity? Protesting during a league game is one thing. Doing so during international matches is another. It sends the message that her differences with her country are irreconcilable to the point she, even on the grandest global stage of them all, cannot set them aside.

If these differences are irreconcilable, then why not follow the example of Hinkle and commit the ultimate protest of all: leave the national team? This would at least be consistent with Rapinoe’s belief that U.S. Soccer has insufficiently addressed the critical issues of the day, accusing the federation of “[trying] to just stop me from doing what I’m doing instead of at least having a conversation, and trying to figure out a [solution] that makes sense for everyone.”

Only extreme culture warriors honestly believe institutions like U.S. Soccer can solve all the world’s problems. They’re not policymakers nor partisan institutions. They exist solely to regulate a game beloved by millions around the world, entertain and, hopefully, unite a world in a shared passion.

For that unity to manifest, players must be willing to set aside their differences when walking onto the pitch. Representing all Americans includes representing those they don’t see eye-to-eye with.

The overall controversy would be minimal had Rapinoe chosen to pursue social justice during her personal time, but her insistence on using the soccer pitch to do it has made the situation more fraught than it needs to be. In the end, her “somber protest” will find acclaim among those who share her views and upbraid those who simply want to see the United States win another world title without engaging in self-loathing. Less hyperpartisanship might be a tough ask, but more is the last thing America needs.

Unfortunate as her actions may prove, Americans who choose to tune in to the 2019 Women’s World Cup can offset any negative impact her “somber protest” will have by setting the example themselves—support the USWNT and Rapinoe in a highly competitive tournament. It would send the message that, for all our differences, we still comprise one nation worth honoring and proudly representing on the world stage, proving again that yes, we can rise above our differences and accomplish great things. It’s the American thing to do.

"No, Defining Men As Men In Federal Regulations Will Not Kill Trans People","In a hysterical headline, even for LGBT media, Queerty breathlessly announced that President Trump’s latest proposed rule change will kill lots of trans people. Lambda Legal sounded the alarm:

🚨🚨🚨#𝘽𝙍𝙀𝘼𝙆𝙄𝙉𝙂: @HHSGov just dropped the final ""conscience rule"", which invites discrimination in health care settings against #LGBTQ folks, women, religious minorities & other marginalized groups. This is disastrous. #DenialOfCare

Read it here:https://t.co/r3FtX7Q1BS pic.twitter.com/a7KjUMzmUI — Lambda Legal (@LambdaLegal) May 2, 2019

As one might expect, this is not exactly accurate. Citing The Hill, Queerty says the change “would make it easier for doctors, hospitals and insurance companies to deny care or coverage to transgender patients, as well as women who have had abortions.” The article continues:

This is why people freak out when bakers refuse same-sex couples wedding cakes. It isn’t about cake, it’s about all the other professions that could simply decide not to help LGBTQ people because it violates their religious freedoms. In this instance, it’s literally a case of life and death. If a doctor or emergency room worker can legally refuse to care for a trans person, where the h-ll are trans people supposed to get medical care, especially if they live in a small, conservative rural area with only one doctor or hospital?

Let’s Check In with Reality for a Minute

The proposed change was announced by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in May. On May 24, HHS announced another rule change to recognize “sex” by its biological meaning rather than the Obama-era revision that had added “gender identity.” The New York Times detailed the proposal last year: “Under the existing rule, health insurers cannot place arbitrary limits or restrictions on health services that help a person transition from one gender to another. These services may include counseling, psychotherapy, hormone therapy and a variety of surgical treatments.”

The Obama administration required health insurance companies to pay for transgender-specific services that had previously been considered elective or cosmetic. Roger Severino, the director of HHS’s Office for Civil Rights, argued in the Times, “The court held that the regulation’s coverage of gender identity and termination of pregnancy was contrary to law and exceeded statutory authority, and that the rule’s harm was felt by health care providers in states across the country.”

Essentially, religious hospitals opposed paying for and performing contraception, abortion- or abortion-related interventions, and transgender medical interventions that often involve elective sterilization. This was the case at Mercy San Juan Medical Center. Evan Minton claimed the hospital discriminated against him for refusing to perform an elective hysterectomy on him.

The Catholic hospital morally opposed elective sterilization for Minton. The patient’s transgender identity was not at issue, as they would also have refused any woman who requested the same procedure without a valid medical reason. The left insisted an elective hysterectomies for transgender individuals are medically necessary and therefore other people should be forced to provide them. To avoid these kinds of scenarios, the Trump administration adapted the law to provide more protections for religious institutions.

Misleading Manipulation

Truthfully, LGBT advocates are simply manipulating the truth. By claiming anything remotely transgender-related is “health care,” they insulate themselves from relevant questioning. By arguing that the proposed revision will allow hospitals or medical staff to “deny trans people care,” they send themselves down a rabbit hole of terrifying possibilities that simply never manifest in reality.

It is preposterous to jump from a surgeon working in a Catholic hospital refusing to perform an elective hysterectomy on a perfectly healthy female body to arguing that an emergency room worker would deny life-saving care to a transgender person in a car accident. But LGBT people and media constantly conflate the two.

In the above case, the patient’s surgeon scheduled the procedure at the hospital but was informed that due to the institution’s religious nature, they could not allow her to perform the surgery there. They instead referred both the surgeon and the patient to a nearby secular hospital that was happy to offer its services. In the LGBT narrative, this was considered discrimination. Yet the notion that a transgender patient was “denied” care is simply untrue.

What LGBT people are truly arguing for is medical validation of transgender identities and exclusive access to otherwise elective procedures not normally covered by health insurance. A woman wishing to have cosmetic breast surgery pays out of pocket, but a transgender person requiring the identical service would get other people to pay for it.

The Trump administration’s rules change would not directly affect health insurance coverage for transgender-related medical options. Each insurer can still choose what to cover.

What has become a mantra of the left in recent years—that “access” requires fully covered insurance—is not accurate in practice. If transgender people are not able to obtain the services they want at a Catholic hospital, they can pursue secular hospitals that cater to their medical wishes. In the worst-possible scenario, they may be required to pay for their procedure themselves.

In contrast, no hospital in the country is going to turn them away if they have a heart attack, need blood work, or have the flu. In such cases of pressing medical need, their gender identity continues to remain irrelevant.

Mixing Kids With Drag Queens Sets Gay Rights Back Decades,"The first organized effort to oppose the gay rights movement came as argument that many today would find absurd. In 1977, the well-known singer Anita Bryant learned of a new city ordinance in Miami, Florida designed to protect gays and lesbians from employment discrimination.

Among other things, the law prevented private Christian schools from discriminating against openly gay teachers. As the Washington Post reported at the time, “‘This is not a campaign to kick the homosexuals out of where they’ve always been,’ said Bob Green, Bryant’s husband and business manager. ‘It’s strictly a defensive measure on our part.’ Save Our Children contends that passage of the law will enable homosexuals to ‘recruit’ youths.”

Thus, the battle over sexual identity in public life found its key debating point: How would it affect children? Over the course of this long debate, the religious right routinely came back to this argument, and much of the gay rights movement’s message developed around disproving the accusation.

For example, in 1981, Jerry Falwell sent a fundraising letter warning, “Please remember, homosexuals don’t reproduce! They recruit! And they are out after my children and your children.” In 1992, conservative writer Judith Ann Reisman argued that the gay rights movement was primarily focused on recruitment efforts, speculating that 20-30 percent of America’s youth would be recruited into homosexual activity by increased public exposure.

Despite the last two decades or so of progress in significantly reducing this stereotype, the progressive movement, as it tends to do so often, has pushed the boundaries too far. This deeply embedded fear of what might happen to children has bubbled back up to the surface. The current LGBT movement’s fixation on child drag queens and transgender identity in children certainly appears to validate Bryant and her day’s Religious Right. The sudden prominence of adult gay men dressed as caricatures of women and reading to preschool-aged children has resurfaced this long-held fear.

The official organization, called Drag Queen Story Hour, does little to dissuade this view, either. Their website states, “DQSH captures the imagination and play of the gender fluidity of childhood and gives kids glamorous, positive, and unabashedly queer role models. In spaces like this, kids are able to see people who defy rigid gender restrictions and imagine a world where people can present as they wish, where dress up is real.”

A participating drag queen named Santana Pilar Andrews said he had grown up feeling different and being bullied and hoped Drag Queen Story Hour would allow children, often as young as three, to find normalcy in being different. But for many concerned about the program, it certainly sounds like the organization is seeking to influence the sexual and gender identities of the kids they entertain.

Supporters argue the entertainment is not only harmless fun for everyone involved, but positive for the gay men as well. Jonathan Hamilt, who co-founded The Drag Queen Story Hour, argued it helps gay men “to get out of the night life and into their communities, their neighborhoods, their towns where they live, and give back.”

In another interview, Hamilt said, “Wherever we go there is a big community who come out — especially in more rural or conservative areas, people come from farther away to support our events because nothing like this has happened there before. There is a big need for it in areas that aren’t liberal big cities.” Clearly, supporters believe it is an extremely positive part of every child’s life to interact with LGBT role models.

There is no doubt many who participate in these events are harmless and are genuinely seeking to be a positive influence. Andrews says, “I can go in and entertain adults in a club and also entertain a group of students and young children. I’m able to do that because I’m an adult and able to filter myself.”

There is also the risk of sex offenders engaging in the program as drag queens, as has happened in Houston, Texas. For the most part, however, children most likely see the adults as merely characters entertaining them, as at a theme park or if a clown read to them. It is unlikely a three-year-old will understand that the person reading to her is really a man dressed a woman in an effort to inspire openness to sexuality and gender identity.

But there is a larger issue at hand. Drag queens are adult entertainment. There is no way around this reality. From the make-up to the dress to the personality, a drag queen is built from the ground up as a caricature of a sexual, adult woman.

This is the fun of drag culture for many. Drag queens are associated with sassy, edgy and explicitly blunt humor and sexuality. They are allowed to be over-the-top and aggressively sexualized because they are meant to be exaggerations. A man dressing as a drag queen to read to children is essentially the same as a female adult entertainer teaching a preschool dance class while fully clothed. It just does not work, despite the innocence of the intention or of the children involved.

I was once asked to speak to a middle school about Jewish identity and culture. During a class discussion, one of the kids asked if my wife was also Jewish. I answered that my husband was not Jewish, but had moved here from Scotland, which they all found fascinating.

The kids did not seem to care about the “wife/husband” substitution or the realization that I was a gay man. But I also did not elaborate on my sexual identity. In drag queen events, LGBT advocates want LGBT people to be active in everyday life and for children to see them as normal, as was my experience. They want young LGBT kids in the room to see someone like them and not feel so alone. But doing so through the more elaborate and extreme versions of sexual and gender identity is not the way to do it.

When LGBT activists argue their goal is to introduce preschool-aged children to concepts of gender-fluidity and openly “queer” people, they are arguing for forcing leftist views about sexuality and gender on children. That, in many ways, is what the conservative opposition is truly about.

We do not want kids to be confused by a culture that cannot decide if drag queens are positive expressions of queer identity or a transphobic mockery of gender identity. We do not want kids to be pushed into believing their childhood exploration of identity is evidence they must change everything about themselves. We don’t want kids to look up to adult men dressed as sexualized caricatures of women and believe this is, indeed, normal or respectful towards women.

In this, the movement has lost its way. Rather than enjoy the vast and open freedom and acceptance LGBT people have in our culture, they continually believe they are entitled to push the limits. By promoting adolescent boys as drag queens and intentionally setting up events in which adult entertainers entertain children, they have reignited the fears the community spent 30 years fighting.

The majority of gay men who work as drag queens are not out to hurt kids, but LGBT activists are placing them in increasingly compromising social positions. Drag queens were never meant to be educators or entertainers to children.

In many ways, Anita Bryant foresaw a movement pushing the boundaries too far, too fast. While the LGBT movement has become such an accepted and normal part of society that drag queens are generally looked upon as playful, funny adult entertainers, progressive extremism is undermining this progress. Drag queens should not be teaching children. The LGBT community loses nothing by respecting the boundaries of adult entertainment and could lose everything if they continue to push this envelope.

Do Alarmist Surveys Of LGBT Youth Make Their Mental Health Worse?,"Is it possible the media’s obsession with the idea of LGBT oppression has created the negative environment marinating LGBT youth once they realize they belong to one of the hundreds of “other” sexual orientations and gender identities?

An incredibly disturbing report by the Trevor Project, an LGBT suicide prevention organization, is causing a great deal of discussion. The report is the largest national survey of LGBT youth ever conducted, with 34,000 respondents. The survey asked 13- to 24-year-old self-identified LGBT individuals a series of questions related to mental health and discrimination over the course of 2018. Of this, 25,896 of the online responses were considered valid in the data analysis.

The results were extremely troubling: 39 percent of the respondents stated they had considered suicide in the last year, while 18 percent of the gay, lesbian, or bisexual respondents claimed they had attempted suicide. That number was even higher for transgender and non-binary respondents, with 29 percent of them responding that they’d attempted suicide.

The report connected the experience of conversion therapy and discrimination or bullying with suicide, reporting that 42 percent (LGBT; 57 percent trans/non-binary) of those who experienced conversion therapy had attempted suicide. Disturbingly, the highest risk group for attempted suicide was 13- to 17-year-old respondents. The numbers align with the 2017 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report on LGBT suicide for those ages 13 to 18. As with any survey, this must be reviewed critically, and it appears to have plenty of flaws.

Methodology

The survey was conducted online and the participants were recruited through targeted ads. An article criticizing Facebook for denying one of the ads based on its targeting of LGBT individuals shows that one example ad states, “LGBTQ+ Youth! We want to know about your experiences with mental health. Share your story in this survey! Remember, if you or someone you know needs support, we’re here for you.”

This assumes a need for mental health support, which seems likely to attract individuals who fit those categories. Self-reported surveys are also widely known to have major accuracy problems. As one study put it, “there is a substantial amount of error in individuals’ self-assessment of health and 2) reliability is worse for disadvantaged sociodemographic groups…”

Compounding the known problems with self-reported health information are also widely known accuracy problems with studies where participants opt themselves in to participating, or self-select. In short, if people are not selected randomly and not assessed by an objective third party, the information they generate is next to useless in terms of research quality. These kinds of survey methods are at the heart of the current replication crisis centered on the social sciences.

Even if we take the survey results at face value — a dubious assumption — there are easily observable problems with it. One concern, for example, is the statement that 24 percent of LGBT youth attempted suicide in the last year. This would indicate that 6,215 individuals, with 2,175 (35 percent) of them under the age of 16, had attempted suicide in 2018.

This creates a serious ethical concern: 2,000 children under the age of 16 were asked on an anonymous online survey if they had ever attempted suicide and they answered yes, with no further intervention on their behalf. Of those who said they were considering suicide, 11,653 (45 percent) answered yes, with 4,078 of them under the age of 16. It seems that this kind of survey should be managed by medical professionals capable of addressing these statements rather than an online platform.

Conversion Therapy

Conversion therapy is an extremely controversial topic. A 2018 Williams Institute report estimated that nearly 700,000 LGBT individuals between the age of 18 and 59 had gone through conversion therapy, with 350,000 reporting having done so as adolescents. The report indicated that without legal intervention, 20,000 LGBT minors would undergo conversion therapy from a licensed health-care professional.

Currently, 16 states ban the practice for minors under the age of 18. The report states that 5 percent of respondents have gone through conversion therapy. All accrediting medical boards and national medical organizations denounce the practice, with the American Psychiatric Association publicly announcing this position in 1998.

If the Trevor Project takes on the same assumption as the Williams Institute, where did nearly 1,300 LGBT individuals between the ages of 13 and 24 find licensed therapists to perform this practice? The survey does not specify how it defines “underwent conversion therapy.” It is possible the respondents were referencing a religious practice or other unlicensed counseling?

To complicate matters, the report states that two in three LGBT youth, or 67 percent, reported that “someone tried to convince them to change their sexual orientation or gender identity.” This vague line of reasoning is as difficult to pinpoint as the fact the report boasts that 22 percent of respondents reported one of 100 different sexual orientations not standard in “homosexual” or “bisexual” and 33 percent of transgender or non-binary individuals reported one of 100 separate alternative gender identities. It begs the question as to what exactly is being experienced by this segment of the population through the filter of traditional ideas on LGBT discrimination and social stress.

Causation

A particularly frustrating aspect of this study is the assumption that sexual orientation or gender identity is the trigger rather than a cofactor in the individuals being surveyed. For example, according to the Centers for Disease Control, 67 percent of new HIV diagnoses are gay and bisexual men. Of that population, 26 percent of new diagnosis come from 13- to 24-year-old gay and bisexual male youth.

The CDC also reported that 23 percent of LGBT high school students had experienced sexual violence from a partner, with 18 percent reporting rape. LGBT adolescents are 90 percent more likely than their heterosexual peers to abuse illicit drugs. There is clearly more to this story than what LGBT media are reporting.

There is also a major concern about what experts call “suicide contagion.” Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute reported that “More than 50 studies on nonfictional stories reported in newspapers, on television, and more recently on the Internet, have yielded consistent findings. Suicide rates go up following an increase in the frequency of stories about suicide.” Along these lines, it is important to recognize that the Trevor Project report states that 71 percent of participants reported feeling “sad or hopeless” for at least two weeks in the last year and 76 percent reported that recent politics had negatively affected their mental health or “sense of self.”

Vox described the new generation of glamorizing mental health issues in media: “13 Reasons Why in particular treats its heroine’s death [suicide] as a victory of sorts, a way for her to achieve popular immortality and triumph over her enemies.” A detailed 2018 study in the American Journal of Preventative Medicine found that children and minors with “adversity” cofactors such as unusual stress or age-inappropriate forms of anxiety or depression are far more likely to engage in suicidal thinking if they knew someone who had attempted suicide themselves.

So what’s happening and why isn’t it being fully reported on? LGBT acceptance is widely expressed in every possible form of media, with June’s Pride Month festivities a yearly reminder of just how dedicated our society is to celebrating this small minority. Today, the experience of a gay teenager is vastly different than it was for those of us who came out 20 years ago.

Is the LGBT Media Complicit?

Furthermore, the idea that thousands of kids are sifting through dozens upon dozens of possible sexual orientation and gender identity options that instantly make them feel as though they are a target, encouraged by LGBT media, is disturbing. Their perception of being targeted based on their identity could be more difficult to manage at that age than any bullying or harassment they may experience. This is demonstrated by the fact that 87 percent said they shared their sexual orientation with their straight friends and 59 percent shared their gender identity. Where is the outside negative influence coming from?

The Trevor Project does good work and provides a safe place for at-risk youth to reach out for help. There is absolutely value in understanding the current effect of suicide behaviors to determine the best ways to intervene and prevent harm. But asking such young people about such deeply troubling emotional issues without medical supervision should be challenged. The LGBT media exploit surveys like this to validate their prior political narratives, but rarely stop to think about the 13- to 16-year-olds who consistently see that they are supposed to be afraid, anxious, depressed, and isolated from their peers.

Children are being expected to handle adult concepts of self and identity that the majority of adults can barely grasp. Yet they are left to ponder what it means for them to be alone and different than others, along with the narrative that they are constantly under attack. We have reached a point of obsession that is causing the very symptoms we wish to fight.

How many of those kids took this survey and found themselves overwhelmed by what it meant for them? How many today see the headlines declaring “Nearly 40% of LGBTQ Youth Have Contemplated Suicide: Report,” as Rolling Stone did, and think their fears and anxiety are normal and outside of their control? How many will begin imagining a lost future because the media tells them so many others like them have given up hope?

We live in the freest time in history for self-expression. There is absolutely no reason LGBT youth should feel this depth of hopelessness. I challenge the LGBT media to make the effort to celebrate the wonderful freedoms we do have and understand that the next generation of LGBT kids are not merely a political tool. They need to be encouraged and uplifted, not told to be afraid.

Australian Rugby Star Sacked For Posting Christian Meme On Instagram,"A huge free speech case is raging in Australia, and it’s symptomatic of the culture war across the Anglosphere. Israel Folau, an Australian rugby star who posted a Christian meme on his Instagram, was sacked from his team because the post was deemed homophobic.

The Instagram meme said everyone who is a cheater, adulterer, homosexual, drunkard, fornicator, gambler, etc., would go to hell and they should repent, followed by a direct quote from the biblical book of Galatians. It did not single out LGBT people, according to Miranda Devine, a columnist for The Daily Telegraph. Nevertheless, a standard evangelical post was used to make an example out of anyone who professes his faith, if that faith happens to oppose homosexual behavior.

That didn’t stop there of course. The majority of the Polynesian players who play for sports teams in Australia and New Zealand are devout Christians, often some of the most practicing in the entire world. Floau’s case has been dubbed a deterrence effort.

For example, GoFundMe, where Folau initially located his legal defense fund, abruptly closed his account, accusing him of bigotry. Fighting so-called bigotry and promoting so-called tolerance and inclusivity was the reason, according to GFM spokeswoman Nicola Britton in a report by the BBC. The account had accrued around $700,000 in donations by the time of its closing.

Folau claimed he was being discriminated against. His wife, Maria Folau, a netball player in New Zealand, is facing calls for sacking for supporting her husband. This has prompted commentators to ponder whether there is any “neutral public square” left, and if not, how to fight back.

The Australian Christian lobby, meanwhile, has pulled resources to start a fund for Folau’s legal defense. This is a curious case and comes at a peculiar time of the culture war.

The Power of Woke Mobs

Not a day goes by when the power of woke capital doesn’t seem prominent and ever increasing. Consider the latest few cycles of news. For example, an online yarn arts community, known as the Facebook of knitting, not just banned specific arguments or words but the entire support of a whole political party. Ravelry banned all material deemed to be supportive of Trump.

This is not some data censorship or shadowy algorithm, but a full-on ban of an elected president’s support, by any and everyone. The excuse was typically weasely, centering around how Trump is apparently a racist, sexist, homophobe. Such words have no meaning, given Trump’s Jewish son-in-law, the record-breaking number of women in his cabinet, and his record on LGBT issues. It’s idiotic to say a lifelong socially liberal New Yorker is suddenly a bigot.

But the bigger issue, which is a test case if it goes without any pushback, is whether any social media platform with millions of followers can simply ban one political ideology and adherents of a specific political party. Likewise, the only issue that somehow is always at the censorship crossroads is faith.

Simultaneously, not a day goes by when there’s no controversy over children in drag or the outright promotion of pedophilia on online platforms. Children in drag is, purely from a numerical angle, is more offensive to a greater number of people than someone simply posting a Bible verse. It is actually physically and psychologically scarring, compared to mere words. Nevertheless, those never see any ban.

One can either logically support the freedom of private companies to decide, but one cannot cherry pick the principle to apply based on the political side. If one is inclined to support any social media company’s right to promote outright discrimination, then he should also be open to any baker refusing to bake a cake, or any religious charity hospital refusing to perform an abortion.

Unfortunately, we are at a time of flux, when these rules are seemingly fluid and the discrimination at big corporations is pretty much always one-sided.

Larger Phenomena at Play

There is a larger sociological phenomenon at work here: The idea of intersectionality is coming to a headlong clash all across the globe due to its inherent contradictions. At a time when one of the most prominent Democratic frontrunners is calling for reparations to all gay couples who weren’t given marriage licenses in the past, it is the testament of mainstream media that minority voters still lean left.

Consider the evidence: There’s a lot more acceptance of LGBT legal preferences among urban educated whites than among rural whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asian/Indian Americans. While open homophobia has subsided across the board, liberal whites are far more pro-gay than is any other ethnicity, especially Hispanics who tend to be, statistically speaking, the least tolerant of gay rights.

Likewise, African-Americans are far more Christian and religious than media and political elites. Likewise, in the United Kingdom, it is mostly the minority communities that are spearheading opposition to LGBT curricula in junior schools.

Now, without taking any sides in this debate, it’s worth noting that this coalition of rainbow business is unsustainable. These are two fundamental issues facing right-wing parties across the Anglosphere.

As I’ve written before, intersectionality is like a religion, and the sins of intersectionality are growing increasingly applicable to normal people. Like every expansionist religion in its early days, it is pervasive, puritanical, and universalist, and takes no prisoners. It battles with every other established religion.

But sooner or later, it will reach a boiling point: “There is a reason crusading, fanatical religions mellow down with time. Any and all fanaticism contains within itself the seeds of self-destruction. Fanaticism alienates normal people, purifying fire and hypocrisy, and fanatical liberalism is no exception.”

Everything that used to be a private affair has become overwhelmingly public in the last decade or so, and given the trends, will continue to be even more; with more freakish, outlandish, and borderline deviant afflictions being pushed mainstream in the name of sexual tolerance. Corporate capital is trying to latch onto these issues more and more, making it even more in-your-face, which will exacerbate even more cultural warfare.

The Right Needs to Reach Out to Ethnic Voters On This

Any opposition or questioning of any slippery-slope ideas, narratives, or agenda is gradually becoming considered bigotry and will result in one-sided discrimination and censorship, usually disproportionately against conservatives. The pattern will be simple.

First, there would be a declaration that one is only against bigotry, and no one who is not a bigot has anything to fear from any deplatforming, harassment, or social censorship. Second, the powers that be wil decide that anything they oppose is bigotry. All one needs to do is paint someone, anyone, any group with the sins of the religion of intersectionality, and no trial will be needed. They will simply be punished.

These trends alienate more and more normal, God-fearing social conservatives of all races, age groups, and ethnicities. From the curious case of Folau’s public trial in Australia to social media bans and harassment of conservatives in the United States to LGBT curricula promotion in kindergartens in the U.K., all of it helps to exemplify this trend.

Conservatives across the world need to understand that they have to both tackle platform censorship and invite the alienated crowd to their side, or else they will perish.

CA Legislators Blame Religious People For High LGBT Suicide Rates,"Legislators in California have discovered yet another way to make it clear that mainstream religions holding to the sexual teachings of their sacred texts have no business doing so in the Golden State. Why? Because these faiths, which billions of good people worldwide happily hold, do not embrace homosexuality. This includes the three largest: Christianity, Islam, and Judaism.

In a resolution that recently passed the state assembly, “the Legislature calls upon all Californians to embrace the individual and social benefits of family and community acceptance” of LGBT people. It singles out especially faith-motivated individuals and organizations.

These legislators make a very ugly accusation against such people. California lawmakers are planning to spread the idea, with the power and moral authority of the state, that such religious beliefs actually kill people, including children. The text of this bill boldly states:

WHEREAS, The stigma associated with being LGBT often created by groups in society, including therapists and religious groups, has caused disproportionately high rates of suicide, attempted suicide, depression, rejection, and isolation amongst LGBT and questioning individuals…

Note the absoluteness of their conclusions, particularly two words: create and cause. Stigma, created by religious groups, causes high rates of suicide.

Do Religious People Make Others Commit Suicide?

Let it sink in. Christians, Muslims, and Jews, your beliefs make gay people kill themselves. If this is indeed true, we are among the worst of the worst kinds of people. These legislators believe this is true and are doing something about it. California is trying to insist that churches, synagogues and mosques, their leaders, congregants, grade schools, universities, and families fully and uncritically support homosexual, bisexual, and transgender identities in every way.

Thus, any teaching, preaching, writings or practices that are faithful to the clear sexual instructions of these faiths will be beyond the pale of official California values. They will not be tolerated. This charge makes this legislation overwhelmingly serious and consequential because of the seriousness of this charge. Either one party is directly culpable for deaths or the other of making such a dreadful allegation.

To be clear, what they’re proposing is a resolution and would not have the razor-sharp edge of law. But it would have the real and devastating blunt force of state-sanctioned shaming of religious convictions. They couldn’t criminalize you, but they could obliterate your reputation and your life. There are too many vivid examples of this already. Of course, this resolution will grease the skids for it becoming enforceable law.

I want to demonstrate, through some objective and undeniable facts, coupled with simple reasoning, why this long-used accusation has no foundation. The case consists of three basic points:

There is simply no dependable research support for the accusation. None.

Gay and lesbian individuals themselves report being significantly more likely to choose to attend the very churches that teach a more traditional sexual ethic than they do so-called “welcoming and affirming” churches.

The most dramatically gay-friendly places in the world still have incredibly and disproportionately high rates of suicides among their gay and lesbian individuals.

1. No Real Evidence

There is no reputable, serious research showing people commit suicide because a particular religion refuses to embrace homosexuality. None. It is largely created as an ideological assumption and political cudgel. But to even question the assertion will cast you immediately as a heartless stone. Remember, any science that does not permit it to be questioned has become fundamentalist dogmatism.

There is a very small amount of literature on the general harms of family rejection (which we at Focus on the Family strongly advise against), but none showing it causes suicide. There is certainly none establishing religious causation. That is an objective fact. Quite simply, anyone making the claim family responses and religious teaching cause suicide do so absent any bit of scientific proof.

2. LGBT People Choose More Traditional Churches

Let’s look at data that raise serious questions about the “religion kills” assertion. Research done by two gay-friendly scholars from Columbia and the University of California at Los Angeles found that, to their absolute disbelief, church-attending, same-sex-attracted individuals are 2.5 times more likely to attend congregations that hold and teach a more traditional, biblical view of sexuality than they are to attend so-called welcoming and affirming churches.

Let’s consider the implications of this interesting finding. Suppose for a moment that the “religion kills” accusation is correct. Either these individuals are too dull to realize they are doing grave harm to themselves by regularly attending such churches, or they find such churches are quite lovely and helpful. Why else would they choose to wake up early on a Sunday morning and go to the trouble of getting themselves there?

This study’s abstract states, “Guided by minority stress theory, the authors hypothesized that exposure to non-affirming religious settings would lead to higher internalized homophobia, more depressive symptoms, and less psychological well-being.” They were honest in admitting they found “There was no main effect of non-affirming religion on mental health, an unexpected finding discussed in this article.” No main effect on mental health itself, much less suicide.

3. Gay-Affirming Societies Also Have High Suicide Rates

Leading gay activists and their faithful allies in the media and academia operate on a simple and seemingly reasonable premise: non-acceptance of homosexuality leads to greater levels of suicide. To reduce these tragic rates, replace non-acceptance with full affirmation and all will be well. Doing so would not only dramatically reduce suicide, but also the disproportionately higher levels of mental illness among this population, which are strongly and consistently documented. (See here, here and here for just three strong examples.)

This thesis is easy to test: Determine the most gay-affirming places in the world. Are the suicide rates of gay and lesbian individuals in these places significantly lower than in non-affirming countries?

The most gay-affirming places on the planet are the Netherlands and Scandinavia. In Amsterdam, the gay movement has received every major law, policy, or cultural accommodation they’ve requested, with nearly no opposition, and often with great celebration. They televise their annual gay pride parade, and Amsterdam spends more than a million euros a year to promote itself as “The Gay Capital of the World.” The land of windmills and tulips is gay Valhalla.

Their gay and lesbian suicide rates should be extremely low, if non-existent, right? That is not what scholars, government officials, and clinicians find. Rates of suicide and suicidal ideation among gay youth and adults are remarkably, tragically high in the Netherlands. Scholars even have a name for this. They call it the “Dutch Paradox.”

Despite the Netherlands’ reputation as a world leader with respect to gay rights, homosexual Dutch men have much higher rates of mood disorders, anxiety disorders and suicide attempts than heterosexual Dutch men. Epidemiologists report similar disparities elsewhere in Western Europe and North America. [Emphasis mine.]

Let’s look at just a few examples of evidence. A 2006 Dutch study published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior reported that despite living “in a country with a comparatively tolerant climate regarding homosexuality” gay and lesbian-identified people were at dramatically higher risk for suicidality than the general Dutch population.

More recently, a 2016 Swedish study shows that the rate of gay males suffering from lifetime suicidal ideation there is 140 percent greater. The same measure for women there is 110 percent higher than the general population. Bisexuals are curiously even higher, with females 250 percent more likely and bisexual men 160 percent.

In France, fourth on the world’s gay-friendly list, gays and lesbians are on average 80 percent more likely to suffer suicidal ideation than their straight peers. All countries that keep such data show similar findings, regardless of changes in attitudes and policies concerning LGB-identified individuals.

Do Same-Sex Marriage Licenses Affect Rates?

With greater specificity, a 2016 study published in the European Journal of Epidemiology examined how legalizing gay-marriage affected suicidality. It should have reduced it, right? Yet Swedes in same-sex marriages, enjoying their anticipated greater social acceptance and security, retained suicide rates nearly three times that of their married opposite-sex peers. The authors caution these numbers are likely an underestimation. A similar study found that Danish men in legal same-sex unions had a dramatic eightfold increase in suicide deaths over opposite-sex married peers.

The fact of the matter is this: There is no research whatsoever demonstrating significantly reduced rates of suicidal deaths or attempts among gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgendered people as the overall acceptance or affirmation of these groups in a country increases. Any honest person who knows this literature well will admit it.

Thus, this is the conclusion that must be admitted: If the “acceptance of homosexuality equals reduction of suicide” thesis has any validity to it, a society would need to far exceed the acceptance, affirmation, and even celebratory actions of the Netherlands and other countries to demonstrate it. Of course, this is reasonably impossible. What is there left to do that these countries are not already doing?

Reasonable people, even those in the gay rights movement, must call for a sharp end to the absolutely vile and false accusation that certain mainstream religious traditions are culpable for the deaths of gay and lesbian people. The Bible Belt does not run through Amsterdam, Stockholm, or Copenhagen.

We must admit that something else is driving the tragically high suicide rates of our gay and lesbian neighbors, and it’s not traditional faith convictions. True compassion demands we find out what that cause is; these lives are too valuable to play baseless politics with.

Disagreeing About Homosexuality Is Fine. Attacking People Over It Isn't,"What is the line between commentary and cruelty, between disagreement and bigotry, between intolerance and hatred? As conservatives we are constantly challenged to define, explain, justify, and apologize for the social confusion over these questions.

To the left, the answer is simple: if you do not fervently advocate a single, agreed-upon position, you are guilty of the most shameful of the options on this scale of social morality. But to the right the question is more fluid. We value critical disagreement, passionate advocacy, and respectful discord. We know that not everyone will agree with us, and we are not particularly injured by this knowledge.

We know that intolerance, as a concept, is not inherently evil, as we recognize certain social and political actions—such as religious authoritarianism, abortion, the restriction and abuse of human and inalienable rights, bullying and political intimidation, slavery, oppression of women, and so on—simply cannot be tolerated. But we also appreciate a careful distinction in mutual respect for distant and often incompatible worldviews.

Bigotry is defined as intolerance towards those who hold different opinions from oneself. The concept is simple, as it recognizes two distinct groups of thought: you either tolerate and coexist with, or do not tolerate and cannot coexist with, individuals or groups who hold different opinions from what you believe to be morally correct.

The left is intolerant, and the right is manifestly tolerant. This is easy to recognize in the universal outrage and demands to ban “dangerous” ideas so often expressed by those who consider themselves “liberal” and the vast spectrum of social and political thought expressed on the right in friendly company.

In contrast, hatred is a singular and deeply profound obsession with a person, idea, or group of people that consumes a person or a group to such an extent they are incapable of rational consideration for humanity or tolerance. In hatred, the object fixated upon may be totally unaware, but is featured in the internal obsessive thoughts of the person or group lost within it.

This can be readily witnessed by President Trump ruling the thoughts of so many on the left to such an extent they seem incapable of functioning without experiencing rage and profound psychological distress. Many on the right reflected this during President Obama’s tenure in office as well, but political and social hobbyists on the right largely seem to view this type of all-consuming obsession as unhealthy and perplexing. We simply do not value the energy required or the interruption to our regular lives and wellbeing.

A particular feature of humanity stands out beyond these two concepts that is far more personally and socially affecting: cruelty. Cruelty is simply intentionally harming another human being for the amoral joy it provides.

Cruelty is the most difficult of human impulses to understand, and it is the most deeply disturbing to those who value humanity, empathy, and kindness. I can pity bigotry and am saddened and disappointed in the manifestation of hatred, but it is cruelty that personally wounds me even when not directed at me individually. To witness cruelty is to become aware of the depth of human nature our collective faiths and societal enlightenments have desperately, for centuries upon centuries, attempted to restrain and repress.

As a gay person, I am often challenged to justify my alliance with the conservative movement due to then left’s persistent argument that the movement is founded on bigotry, intolerance, and hatred, particularly towards people like me. They cite opposition to LGBT rights, religious opposition to homosexuality, and a more abstract assertion that “hate” motivates the movement on a deep and nearly unconscious level.

When a Christian conservative or a leader in the Republican movement expresses a view, speaks out against a social movement, or promotes or opposes specific legislation related to LGBT people, the left immediately condemns the right as a whole for the social sin of intolerance. Yet, regardless of their baffled outrage and relentless mocking and dismissal, numerous gay and transgender people defend and advocate for the right and its positions.

I have long argued that I simply do not care what a person believes about homosexuality. I only value how they treat me as a person. The line between intolerance and cruelty is found in this distinction.

I follow, engage with, and support many people in the conservative movement who genuinely believe that my marriage is invalid and my lifestyle sinful. If asked honestly, they would state a personal concern for my wellbeing in rejecting what they deeply believe to be the most important of religious and moral behavioral standards. Many people who oppose same-sex marriage in concept and practice do not wish to be exposed to the more liberal expressions of sexuality and identity in their and their children’s daily lives.

But these individuals express their views and beliefs respectfully, as I do my disagreement, and in the end we remain friends and colleagues in our mutual battle against progressivism in our country. Several personally choose to show kindness and happiness for my important life moments and sympathy and friendship in my losses, and I return the kindness.

The left cannot understand why this relationship works, because they believe that consensus defines personal commitment to goodness, whereas we do not require it. It simply does not bother me when someone I respect and value articulates a personal, religious, or moral opposition to homosexuality, just as they do not block me from their view when I share a happy snapshot of my daily life with my husband.

This is what makes the conservative movement such a fulfilling and genuinely purposeful experience, in my opinion. But occasionally an individual crosses a line, and his or her actions are motivated in cruelty rather than disagreement.

I do not view religious opposition to homosexuality as bigotry or hatred. I do not accept that a passionate defense of traditional marriage or of a mother and father household is an expression of homophobic intolerance. I do not demand nor even request that individuals I associate with recognize or validate my marriage so I can feel accepted or included in the political conversation.

I do not deny support or tolerate targeted harassment towards people I follow and respect for expressing socially conservative views on sexuality and identity. The only action that offends me and I find personally distressing is the arrogance of using my sexuality as a weapon to restrict or dismiss my intelligence, integrity, or value as an equal partner in our shared conversation.

If an individual is willing to single out my sexuality or the sexuality of others as a targeted rationale for attempted humiliation, insult, or dismissal, he or she loses my respect and my consideration for their ideas. It is one of the few lines that can be crossed for me to sever connection and personally denounce. I simply do not tolerate it on a personal or public level, towards myself or anyone else.

The right is made of good, honest, kind, and genuine people who often disagree but rarely entertain cruelty.

In my experience, the majority of my friends and co-politicos on the right agree and hold to the same standard of behavior. When a person chooses to cross this line, I have never once witnessed those I interact with daily, who influence the conservative movement, respond with anything less than genuine and swift denunciation and defense of the person targeted.

This has been a consistent and vital foundation that I gratefully stand upon when defending not only my own political views but the movement and the people within it I have adopted now for many years. The right is made of good, honest, kind, and genuine people who often disagree but rarely entertain cruelty. This is the only standard that means anything to me, and it is why those rare moments of cruelty are so aggressively shocking and frustrating.

I am grateful that I stand with people I can effortlessly and confidently call “good” and who value me as an individual they trust enough to disagree with, without fear of retribution or hatred. Thank you all for the countless times you have defended and surrounded me and other gay conservatives with love, kindness and protection. I stand with you too.

I don’t mind political disagreement at all, but for our movement to provide a light to the dark world of politics in any meaningful way it must stand against cruelty. Kindness matters, and more and more it is the most valuable thing we can offer one another.

‘Special’ LGBT-Edition Oreos Indoctrinate Kids About Trans Pronouns,"Oreo cookies, a division of international foods giant Nabisco, announced yesterday a “special” LGBT edition that includes lectures about how to use transgender pronouns.



“We’re proud to celebrate inclusivity for all gender identities and expressions,” the company wrote in its Facebook post announcing the change. “In partnership with NCTE, we’re giving away special edition Pronoun Packs and encouraging everybody to share their pronouns with Pride today and every day.”

Federalist writer Kaeley Triller Harms made this tongue-in-cheek comment in response to Oreo’s post.

So did other commenters. Oddly enough, all the positive comments were on the top of the response feed and I had to scroll all the way down to see negative comments, even with many hundreds more likes and engagements than some of the positive ones.

Notice especially the Orwellian language Oreo’s Facebook responder employed in its first response below. Maybe NCTE taught Oreo that tactic too: “We’re inclusive of EVERYONE, so long as EVERYONE agrees with us!” “We’re so diverse, we’re willing to ignore, sideline, and offend half the country!”

Oreo made clear they’re taking sides in the culture war against half of America with repeated responses to supportive commenters on their post like the one below:

Oreo did not include this in its original post, but in responses to commenters noted that it is not selling these rainbow Oreos, only giving them away at a large LGBT celebration festival. It appears it wants to get all the cred from LGBT politics without alerting the majority of their customers, who probably won’t see their Facebook post and or this offensive product in any store to tip them off. In other words, this is a big, blaring anti-virtue signal.

For my favorite homemade Oreo recipe, which is a billion times better than powdered-sugar-and-Crisco-stuffed, overprocessed, shelf-stable-for-1-million-years wafers anyway, click here. If King Arthur Flour ever goes political, I’m going to cry.

Correction: An Oreo spokeswoman has confirmed that “NCTE” in Oreo’s original Facebook post stood for National Center for Transgender Equality, not the National Council of Teachers of English, as this article originally claimed. Thanks to an alert reader for pointing out the error, and apologies to the wrongly discussed NCTE.

Comfort With LGBT People Is Dropping Since Gender Identities Went Big,"Every year, GLAAD, the organization that advocates for LGBT acceptance in society, conducts a study called the Accelerating Acceptance Index. This national survey takes the country’s temperature about what used to be known as gay and lesbian rights and straight people’s acceptance of them.

While the first three years of the study showed an increase in social acceptance, last year’s study showed a sharp decrease. After a big push by GLAAD during the ensuing year, the results remained mostly stable but did not return to the higher levels of acceptance of previous years.

It was primarily the younger folks surveyed who were responsible for the drop-off. The question is how could this have happened? In this 50th anniversary year of the Stonewall riots, what’s up with the kids?

The survey asks in-depth questions not only about feelings about LGBT individuals and practices, but scenarios involving them as well. Questions concerning comfort levels with LGBT family members, friends, teachers, and peers, as well as academic lessons on LGBT history and social awareness, showed that the group of 18- to 34-year-olds felt the most uncomfortable.

It’s a fascinating turn about, since all previous generations, from boomers to millennials, exhibited an increase in acceptance of LGBT interactions each year. The upshot of all this is that there was a plunge from 63 percent acceptance in 2016 to 45 percent in 2018.

Why the Change in Attitude?

Respondents to the survey were asked about their comfort level with LGBT-identified people in a variety of situations. These included: “learning a family member is LGBTQ,” with 36 percent responding that such a thing would make them “very uncomfortable”; a question about finding out that one’s child is “placed in a class with an LGBTQ teacher,” to which 33 percent said they were “very uncomfortable”; and “learning my child had a lesson on LGBTQ history in their school,” to which 39 percent responded with “very uncomfortable.” A question that wasn’t asked was whether the discomfort was due to the person, or the assumed politics of those individuals.

In the past several years there have been fights over forcing bakeries to make cakes for gay weddings, states opening women’s prisons to male-bodied people, drag shows featuring children, schools interfering between children and parents to establish a child’s trans identity, the emergence of the term “cis” to define the rest of us whether we like it or not, the increasing number of gender identities and the accompanying demands that they be respected or else, the entire pronoun thing, the politicization of rainbows, all the flags and how we’re supposed to know what they all mean, and the takedown of beloved children’s authors as anti-LGBT based solely on their Twitter follows.

Perhaps the LGBTQIAP+ contingent has reached a saturation point in culture and society at large is ready to not think about sexuality all the time. In Manhattan, for example, there were two Pride marches on June 30 in New York. The Reclaim Pride Coalition is offended, like traditional Christians at Christmastime, by the consumerism of the Pride parade. They organized the Queer Liberation March, without police presence or corporate sponsors, to retain the grassroots feel of the original movement.

The NYC Pride parade began as a protest march after Stonewall, and this year has rebranded as the World Pride Parade. Pride and equal rights are so mainstreamed that hundreds of companies offer corporate sponsorships, and there’s nothing wrong with that. It’s a net positive that people are free to live and love as they choose.

The Reclaim Pride Coalition may be right about the negative effects of so much corporatization. This new rollout of “pronoun packs” from Oreo was bound to elicit massive amounts of eye rolling. Was Oreo really saying their classic cookie wasn’t for everyone? Do we need to establish our sexuality and gender identity with every pre-packaged cookie we eat? How did we get to the point where shoving our identifiers into everyone’s face was considered even reasonably polite?

Sephora launched the “identify as we” ad campaign, which definitely has a hivemind ring. Budweiser distributed various LGBT pride flag cups, each for a super-specific identity more obscure than the last. Even Manhattan Mini Storage rolled out a new rainbow logo because storage wasn’t inclusive enough of everything and everyone already.

Pride Is a Good Thing; Being Pushy Isn’t

Pride is a good thing, as nondiscrimination and equal rights are essential for the successful functioning of our civil society. But the overtaking of the Pride movement by the trans agenda really didn’t help matters, and even lots of lesbians want to get the L out.

Believing in total equality for same-sex attracted persons, their right to employment, to marry, to have those unions recognized across state lines, to adopt children and raise families, requires very little imagination from the average straight person. The prior iteration of the gay rights movement did a great job in making the case that same-sex attracted people are not deviants, but simply people who are attracted to members of their own sex as opposed to the opposite one. People got on board. It really didn’t seem like a big deal.

Asking society at large to believe that biological sex is mutable, on the other hand, demands the kind of mental gymnastics or willful ignorance that is mostly found in PhD-level philosophy programs. When you go from “Will & Grace” to Drag Queen Story Hour, you’re gonna lose the kids along the way. LGBTQIAP+ culture is pushing so hard that it’s pushing the kids off the edge.

Giving an interview to Time Magazine, GLAAD President Sarah Kate Ellis said she believes the increase in intolerance from youth is due to a need for more education about LGBT issues. This indicates she isn’t taking to heart the results of the study. Given how much awareness and education is out there for kids about alternative gender and sexual lifestyles — more than ever before — you’d be hard pressed to find an 18- to 34-year-old who didn’t have loads of understanding about the issues.

‘Kids [today] are dealing directly with this generation of people that define sexual orientation and gender identity so broadly,’ Ellis says. ‘They’re finding this newness a little bit confusing…We are absolutely at an inflection point where culture and policy is stalled right now,’ Ellis concludes. ‘Closing the gap to full acceptance of LGBTQ people will not come from legislation on judicial decisions alone, but from creating a culture where LGBTQ people are embraced and respected.’

What she’s missing is that these are not new issues to the 18- to 34-year-old set. Just as they are a generation of tech natives, they are natives in identity politics, the LGBT identity spectrum among them.

If they are feeling uncomfortable about the plethora of gender identities, the crazed concept that biological sex can be changed through surgeries, hormones, and wishes, and just think everyone should live their lives according to their own desires and not impose speech requirements on everyone, they are not wrong. It would do the LGBT movement well to take a step back from total cultural saturation of their cause, and remember that respect for equal rights, and wanting to remember 30,000 different pronouns and to whom they are applied, are completely separate things.

Young Americans Increasingly Uncomfortable With LGBTQ Culture,"For years, the conventional wisdom has been that younger people are more tolerant and progressive regarding LGBTQ people and issues. A new study from GLAAD, a group dedicated to LGBTQ advocacy, suggests the current emphasis on transgenderism and gender-fluidity may be turning off younger Americans.

Last week, GLAAD, in conjunction with the Harris poll, released its fifth annual Accelerating Acceptance Index. The index is a survey measuring how comfortable or uncomfortable Americans are with various LGBTQ-related situations. The first three indexes reported increases in Americans who felt comfortable with LGBTQ issues and people. However, last year’s index indicated a sharp drop in comfort across all of the polled situations.

In this year’s index, polling 1,800 adults, the percentage of non-LGBTQ adults reporting being “very” or “somewhat” comfortable stabilized across the seven scenarios tested. But in four of the seven situations polled, the 18- to 34-year-old bracket reported feeling substantially more uncomfortable.

The percentage of non-LGBTQ young people uncomfortable with learning a family member was LGBTQ has increased from 24 percent in 2016 to 36 percent today. While 25 percent were uncomfortable with their child being placed in a class with an LGBT teacher in 2016, 33 percent say they are uncomfortable now.

The percentage of those uncomfortable with an LGBTQ doctor rose from 24 percent to 34 percent since 2016. The share uncomfortable upon learning their child had a lesson on LGBTQ history in their school increased from 27 percent to 39 percent over the same period. The Daily Beast, breaking down the statistics, found:

Forty-three percent of males ages 18-34 reported that they were uncomfortable learning a family member was LGBTQ (up from 32 percent in 2018) and 42 percent of males ages 18-34 reported that they were uncomfortable learning their child’s teacher is LGBTQ (up from 37 percent in 2018). Forty percent of females ages 18-34 reported that they were uncomfortable learning their child had a lesson on LGBTQ history in school, an increase of 13 percentage points from the previous year’s findings.

Accordingly, GLAAD conducted focus groups to attempt to understand the decline in acceptance among young people. CEO Sarah Kate Ellis told the Daily Beast the poll results can be explained by the “culture of hate and discrimination” fostered by the Trump administration. Ellis also claimed that “newness takes a while to turn into acceptance.” Neither explanation is particularly compelling.

It seems unlikely that President Trump has much to do with the downward trend of the index. Trump has been a constant through the period of decline. He has not been particularly popular with younger voters. Moreover, the Trump administration has taken a tougher line on transgender issues than gay and lesbian issues.

Nor does “newness” in the broadest sense seem convincing. The executive summary for this year’s index claims, “The younger generation has traditionally been thought of as a beacon of progressive values.” This claim seems overhyped, given that Gen Z’s sexual behavior is more conservative than the media narrative suggests. Even so, one would think the “newness” would be more alienating to older Americans. Also, “newness” should diminish as a factor over time, not increase.

Ellis framed the “newness” rationale in a different, perhaps more revealing way to Time magazine: “Kids [today] are dealing directly with this generation of people that define sexual orientation and gender identity so broadly They’re finding this newness a little bit confusing.” What Ellis seems to suggest—as quietly as possible—is that “newness” is code for the explosion of transgender and gender-fluid issues in the culture, as reflected in the establishment media:

Some of you requested it, so here it is pic.twitter.com/pVC4FO66kZ — Zach Goldberg (@ZachG932) May 31, 2019

Perhaps young people find the Great Awokening confusing. After all, younger people are having their own sexual awakenings and struggles, regardless of whether LGBTQ issues are involved.

However, there may be more than confusion at work. As the study’s executive summary notes, the uptick in discomfort comes “[w]hile young people are identifying as LGBTQ in higher rates than ever before.” GLAAD seemingly has not considered whether the two trends are related.

Young people are the ones with the most exposure to LGBTQ education and events like events like “drag queen story time,” whether as students or young parents. They are the group most likely to confront the issue of genetic boys competing in girls’ sports, and genetic boys wanting access to girls’ locker rooms (the reported controversies seem to disproportionately affect genetic girls). As a corollary, young people may be the most concerned about how dissent from transgender and gender-fluid dogma gets enforced through cancel culture.

This appears to be how Andrew Sullivan explains the trend: “The turn began in the year that the Obama administration — with no public discussion or congressional support — imposed critical gender theory on America’s high schools, determining sex to be whatever a student says it is. The imposition of trans ideology by fiat on the entire country’s young — along with severe public stigma for those with even the slightest questions — was almost textbook left authoritarianism.”

Similarly, Jamie Kirchick observes at The Atlantic, “it is the conflation of transgender issues with the gay rights movement, a recent development and not one undertaken without some controversy among gays and lesbians themselves, which accounts for much if not most of the evidence cited as representing regression on gay rights.”

GLAAD apparently believes their problem with younger Americans can be solved with its youth ambassador program, or by promoting more LGBTQ messaging in videogames and country music. But if GLAAD refuses to consider whether LGBTQ has too many letters, the effort may backfire completely.

"Amazon Bans Books About Same-Sex Attraction, Not Nazi Propaganda","When I was growing up, there was one thing sure to stoke the ire of any good liberal: a good old-fashioned book banning. The left considered banning even the most unsavory books as the well-greased slippery slope toward total thought control.

As if it were from Holy Scripture itself, the faithful liberal would declare, misattributing it to Voltaire, “I wholly disapprove of what you say, but will defend to the death your right to say it.” This is a mark of classical liberalism, but liberalism will have nothing of it today. They will happily keep you from reading certain books they deem unsafe and enthusiastically congratulate themselves for doing so.

It’s the new fundamentalism. How the tables have turned!

This is precisely what happened recently when Amazon—a progressive company that should be fundamentally dedicated to the value of the free trade of ideas—succumbed to a silly, poorly argued, emotion-laden Change.org petition by someone going by the name of Sky Gray. Gray was super upset that Amazon, the largest bookseller in the universe and beyond, was doing what it does: selling a vast array of books to anyone who wants them.

Gay Activists Object to People Reading Freely

Specifically, it was selling the books of one man, Dr. Joseph Nicolosi. What makes his books so abominable? Well, they help people who have unwanted same-sex sexual attractions deal with those feelings. It would seem a basic issue of personal autonomy, people desiring to become what they want to be without suffering interference from others, another classically liberal ideal. And yes, some people don’t want to be driven by their same-sex attractions.

But the real “sin” of those who offer such help—a number of other such authors have since had their books banned by Amazon as well—is that they don’t encourage the clients to get all happy about being gay. As anyone knows today, not being all-in for all things gay will not be tolerated. The dissenter will be punished, and severely. Those books, those very ideas will be judged intolerable, and made unavailable to anyone.

Even the most die-hard liberal must condemn this as an extremely troubling development. But it is about so much more than this handful of authors’ books, as serious as that is. When a group of powerful people start determining what you can and cannot read, that is not a pretty place.

Liberals used to understand this. They understand it very well regarding abortion. It’s why they wholly reject any and all restrictions on abortion, even basic health standards for abortuaries and limits on the most ghoulish types of abortion, because they believe that starts the road toward banning all abortions. Not only, however, do they see nothing wrong today with banning books some liberals don’t agree with, they tend to think doing so is highly virtuous.

Understand that the larger topic here is not the ban on owning a book about a particular kind of counseling or self-help. And it’s not just about wholesale prohibition on one’s opposition to homosexuality. It is all about not being all-in on the thing itself. Mere disagreement is not allowed.

Say, for instance, you choose not to celebrate and participate in LGBT pride week at work. That can often get you more than the disapproval of some of your co-workers, or even a sharp reprimand from your human resources department. It could get you fired. You’d also better not donate to a cause LGBT activists deem troublesome. Same for a teacher refusing to butcher her own language with made-up pronouns.

Now the pitchfork and torch-wielding witch-hunt has come for our freedom to obtain and read books others believe are offensive. How long until the most widely read book in the world is banned because it takes a dim view of homosexuality? How long until children’s books are no longer allowed because the illustrator refuses to include same-sex families or insists on using pronouns that are true to biology?

You think this is crazy talk? Name one thing that even the more radical parts of the gay movement have demanded that they haven’t been granted with great fanfare, including arraying the White House in rainbow colors. Name a recent time anyone in mainstream culture has been critical of any action or idea held by a notable gay individual. A gay actor can fake being a victim of a hate-crime, trick the nation into coming to his aid, then have all legal charges dropped after it’s learned he staged the whole thing.

The gay community, a supposedly oppressed and marginalized group, wields an extravagant amount of power today, and does so without regard for the rights of anyone who chooses to not support them. When you can dictate what books someone can have access to, that’s power. When you do so and get no blow-back by hardly anyone (if anyone at all) in the mainstream press that claims undying commitment to the secular sacredness of the freedom to read, that is a frightening amount of power.

We must ask, where are the liberal Voltaires today? They’ve become the new Joseph McCarthys.

Take Note of What Amazon Won’t Ban, Either

There’s something else very disturbing and terribly ironic here. According to Amazon and its petitioners in the gay movement, apparently, there is no one more sinister and dangerous than Nicolosi and his peers. According to their platform publishing decisions, he is literally worse than Adolf Hitler.

How can we know? Well, it’s easy. Amazon will sell you any of Hitler’s many books, give you the best price possible, and rush them right to your door with free shipping. They keep an ample stock of the official 1939 edition of “Mein Kampf,” and if that original language is too cumbersome, you can obtain one that is more useful to the studious American Nazi devotee: “Mein Kampf: A New Translation for American Readers.”

But there’s more. Amazon stocks Hitler’s lesser-known works, too—his “Secret Book” (under its actual title: “Hitler’s Second Book: German Foreign Policy“), his “Mein Kampf” sequel, “My New Order,” and finally, “Hitler’s Table Talk.” You can also get, through Prime, “The Speeches of Adolf Hitler: 1921-1941.”

For the really serious neo-Nazi, Amazon stocks all of Joseph Goebbel’s books. The well-read neo-fascist can get Benito Mussolini’s full corpus. Same with “The Turner Diaries,” the book Timothy McVeigh carried the morning he killed 168 people in the Oklahoma City bombing. Klu Klux Klan leader David Duke even praises Amazon for keeping this classic racist text readily available for his disciples.

Amazon is the anti-government, white supremacist’s reliable, go-to bookseller. But thank goodness they have the moral fortitude and decency to keep certain books that some gay activists dislike from falling into anyone’s hands.

People, this is the world we live in, and it will only get worse unless people of reason, conservative or liberal, stand up and demand that it stops. Amazon’s entry into book banning is where it should start.

Let’s Reform The Way Hate Crimes Are Reported And Tracked,"On the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, USA Today published a report titled, “Anti-LGBT hate crimes are rising, the FBI says. But it gets worse,” arguing that current FBI hate crime statistics do not accurately represent the reality. FBI hate crime numbers indicate roughly 7,500 annual incidents, while the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) reports more than 200,000 annual hate crimes.

Commenting on the discrepancy, Robin Maril, associate legal director for the Human Rights Campaign argued, “If someone comes forward to report a hate crime, they could also be officially outing themselves as LGBTQ. In a smaller or rural community, that outing could result in an eviction or loss of a job.” Maril continued, “The level of discourse that we are getting from the Trump administration and leadership only hurts our community, only hurts trans people…It gives a sense of impunity and a license to harm folks.”

Arguing that the FBI statistics are flawed due to low reporting rates by law enforcement officials throughout the country, Maril said, “There are entire cities that don’t report any hate crimes. Cities like Miami might report zero hate crimes, but a hate crime does occur in Miami at least once a year.”

Roy L. Austin, a Justice Department official under the Obama administration, agreed: “The data is embarrassingly bad for a country that supposedly takes public safety so seriously. One would think that we would do a better job of collecting crime data. And none of our crime data is worse than our hate crime data.” There are about 18,000 police agencies in the country and, as of 2017, 16,149 were participating in the FBI hate crime reporting program—or nearly 90 percent.

Methods of Studying Hate Crimes

The Department of Justice administers two separate hate crime collection methods. The FBI runs the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) and the Bureau of Justice runs the NCVS. The UCR relies on police agency reporting and the NCVS relies on self-reporting surveys.

One major discrepancy is that, between 2003 and 2015, an annual average of 14,380 individuals reported to the NCVS that police had confirmed their attack was a hate crime, while during the same period the UCR only reported 8,370 incidents. To provide perspective, the NCVS estimates an annual average of 252,630 hate crimes with 41 percent reported to police (104,600), with 14 percent (14,380) stating they were confirmed by police.

The NCVS survey describes itself as a “self-report survey in which interviewed persons are asked about the number and characteristics of victimizations experienced during the prior 6 months.” Once a household is selected, the residents of the household remain in the survey for three years and are interviewed every six months, in person or over the phone, for a total of seven interviews.

The Interviewing Manual for the Census Bureau states that all areas of the United States, with a few exceptions, are eligible and that “the households to be interviewed for the NCVS are selected by scientific sampling methods from specific sampling areas across the United States.” In 2015, the most recent survey, 95,760 households and 163,880 individuals age 12 and older were interviewed.

The survey requires three types of evidence for a crime to be considered a hate crime. The victim must provide at least one type of evidence. The offender must have used hate language, left behind a hate symbol, or police investigators must have confirmed the incident was a hate crime. There appears to be no further validation beyond the self-reporting of the individual.

Between 2011 and 2015, 98.7 percent of victims provided “hate language” as evidence of the crime, with 90 percent reporting the incident involved violence or sexual assault. Although not included in the official statistics, the report states that 83 percent provided additional evidence defined as “their feelings, instincts, or perception lead them to suspect this incident was a hate crime or crime of prejudice or bigotry, even though there was not enough evidence to know for sure.”

Characteristics of Victims

Reasons given for not reporting to the police (53 percent of incidents) included 41 percent stating the issue was resolved by another authority such as a school official and one in five simply stated they did not feel their victimization was important enough to report. The most commonly cited reason typically offered in most media reports is that the victim was afraid of the police or felt they would not take them seriously, which accounted for 23 percent in this survey.

Despite Maril’s concern that people in rural areas would be more afraid to report, the survey found only 6.9 percent were from rural areas. The majority of incidents were said to have occurred in urban and suburban areas, primarily in the western U.S. (45.8 percent), with the South representing 18 percent of incidents.

Characteristics provided by victims indicated that the vast majority of offenders were single males, white or black, over the age of 30 and 44 percent of them knew their attacker. The self-described victims are majority white males between the ages of 35 and 64 with either incomes below the poverty line or in the middle-class range.

The focus on LGBT hate crimes in the USA Today article represented 22 percent of of the total victims surveyed which was slightly less than those who reported being attacked for their association with a minority individual. This would indicate an annual average of 44,000 LGBT hate crime victims in comparison to the current 2017 FBI statistic of less than 1,200.

Austin illustrated why these discrepancies matter: “The single most important thing is to link any federal funding on crime prevention on providing accurate and regular numbers.”

What Can We Do About Hate Crime Reporting?

The survey brings up important issues on the way we handle hate crimes and the expected legal and social goal. It is troubling that the Department of Justice relies so heavily on self-reporting, with no independent verification for such important data collection. The overwhelming majority of those claiming to be victims provided only their personal perception of their attacker’s motivations.

The reliance on how the victim felt over what actual evidence is available should not be determining federal resources or law. Case in point, the nearly doubling of “confirmed by police to be a hate crime” in the NCVS report reflects the victim merely saying so to the interviewing agent. In contrast, the UCR cases are vetted and transmitted by police agencies directly to the FBI. It is telling that public criticism is on the flawed reporting by the police.

Another concern is in the definition of “hate crime.” Considering that nearly 20 percent of those interviewed were minors and only needed to report “hate language” being used, it seems this information is poorly substantiated. Hate crime laws are supposed to deter those who would choose to target and violently attack a person over his or her real or perceived sexuality, religion, ethnicity or other immutable characteristics. It was not intended to punish the use of mean words or the perception of malicious intention in an altercation.

Moreover, media shouting that 200,000 people each year are victims of violent hate crimes that the police won’t report to the FBI is reckless and irresponsible. It perpetuates fear and validates petty grievances.

What this survey tells us is that our political leaders need to re-evaluate state and federal hate crime guidelines, requiring a timely report to the police to be considered in legal proceedings. The Hate Crime Statistics Act must be clarified to collect and report only on confirmed incidents of hate crimes rather than socially governed abstract and subjective standards designed to validate the accuser’s feelings rather than scientifically reporting on the confirmed evidence.

Government agencies should be held to a higher standard of reporting on these numbers, as the media simply repeats the major talking points, but rarely investigates the details, leading to wildly misleading headlines and public perception. As illustrated by transgender activist Naomi Green, referring to media reports on anti-LGBT violence, “It’s very traumatizing. … You’re constantly feeling on edge and looking over your shoulder.”

LGBT people are being taught to be afraid, report to interviewers that we are afraid, and then see headlines reporting that a majority of us are afraid. The cycle must end.

"To Protect Human Rights Like Religious Liberty, We Must Define Them","There they stood in the Oval Office: Jews, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, and members of other faiths from every corner of the globe, speaking to the leader of the free world about human rights.

A quiet Holocaust survivor in a pink suit stood near the young, Nobel Prize-winning Nadia Murad, who pleaded for thousands of her Yazidi sisters enslaved by the Islamic State. Also present was the sober but passionate son of Salman Taseer, the brave Muslim official slain by his own bodyguard’s bullet for defending Asia Bibi, his Christian countrywoman, against Pakistan’s blasphemy law.

United by injustice and tragedy, they sought help from America because they have nowhere else to turn.

Religious Freedom Is Under Attack Around the World

According to Pew Research, 80 percent of the world’s population live under serious restrictions of religious freedom. The White House meeting was a culmination of the second annual Ministerial to Advance International Religious Freedom convened by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Sam Brownback, the ambassador-at-large for International Religious Freedom. The State Department estimates that more than 800 like-minded diplomats, advocates, and survivors attended from more than 100 countries.

A few pastors from Cuba were unable to make the trek because their government prevented them from leaving the country. Also absent from the gathering were notorious abusers: Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and North Korea were not invited. Contrary to the narrative that this administration cozies up to dictators, Trump’s team shut those leaders out.

Instead, representatives from every faith and region of the world assembled: the EU Special Envoy for the Promotion of Religious Freedom Ján Figeľ, former U.K. prime minister Tony Blair, Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and the lion of the international religious freedom movement, former Republican Rep. Frank Wolf. In a rare moment of bipartisanship for Washington these days, members of both parties came together for a greater purpose, human freedom.

Human Rights Are Not Man-Made Nor Cultural

In 1785, one of America’s Founding Fathers, James Madison, articulated an eternal truth: man’s duty to obey his creator precedes in time and in degree of obligation any claims of civil society. A century and a half later, in 1948, delegates to the United Nations from America, Canada, China, Lebanon, and France drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, or UDHR, and affirmed Madison’s insight.

The UDHR not only protects freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, it cites man’s endowment with conscience and reason as evidence of human dignity, the source of all universal human rights. As Princeton professor Robert P. George explained at a recent Heritage Foundation event, across the ages and the oceans, man’s nature as conscientious truth-seeker has demanded freedom. Because this freedom is required by something common to all men, it is both universal and pre-political.

But seven decades later, it is abundantly clear that the human rights movement has become unmoored from its foundations — not just from a transcendent source but from nature and reason. Departure from the laws of nature has left rights without claims to universality and vulnerable to the shifting winds of culture and to manipulation by despots.

Communist regimes such as China point to economic growth to deflect criticism of the more than 1 million Uighur Muslims they have put in detention camps. The leftist “woke” West asserts human rights to a clean environment, free internet access, and self- identification as the opposite sex. In the name of combatting “Islamophobia,” theocrats claim Islam (yes, the religion itself) has a right to be free from “defamation.”

In other words, these governments want a right to censor critics and dissidents. When citizens and governments reduce human rights to the man-made products of particular cultures, everyone loses.

The United Nations Is Failing to Protect Human Rights

The United Nations has built a vast human rights bureaucracy over the last seven decades, but there is little indication that this has led to a greater realization of human rights. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres just launched a global initiative against so-called hate speech that should raise the hackles of every freedom-lover.

Like beauty, hate speech is in the eye of the beholder and too frequently in the hands of those who hold power. Power-hungry leaders just happen to define hateful speech as views that run afoul of their orthodoxies.

It is an ominous sign that the Organization of the Islamic Conference, which supports blasphemy laws, also fully supports the U.N.’s new campaign. The U.N. independent expert on sexual orientation and gender identity has explicitly urged member states to punish religious and political leaders’ “hate speech” that offends LGBT sensibilities.

The U.N. Human Rights Council notoriously elects serial human rights abusers such as Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and China to its ranks, causing many to warn that arsonists are in charge of putting out the fires. Last summer, when former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley announced that efforts to reform the council had failed and the United States would withdraw, advocates and U.N. officials accused the United States of a lack of commitment to protecting human rights.

The State Department Is Working for Clarity

Perhaps to better protect universal human rights, we need a clearer understanding of what they are. Recently, Pompeo formed a Commission on Unalienable Rights to initiate this conversation. Almost immediately and reflexively, liberal human rights groups such as Council for Global Equality (an LGBT advocacy group) dismissed and attacked the effort. It derided the commission as anti-woman and anti-LGBT before it even held its first meeting.

State Department officials have explained that universal rights belong to all human beings. There’s no question that freedom from torture is universal and that no one should be subjected to it anywhere at any time, including for homosexual conduct. However, when the U.N. is effectively creating a right not to be offended, there’s a good reason to step back and ask what limiting principles should apply.

Unfortunately, critics have essentially boycotted the discussion before it’s begun. Of course, doing so won’t help the victims who came to the White House or the billions more they represent.

Demonized and abused at home, the survivors found a warm welcome in the Oval Office. Although their theologies differ and sometimes clash, members of the Abrahamic faiths, Bahá’ís, Buddhists, Hindus, and more united in seeking freedom for themselves and for each other. They didn’t seem to care much that groups have criticized the State Department for elevating religious freedom to not just a top human rights priority but a top foreign policy priority.

Instead, for a moment, they basked in the solidarity they shared with one another, the public acknowledgment of the wrongs they had suffered, and the opportunity to make the universal desire for freedom heard.

"As They Maim Children, Activists Claim Criticizing Them Kills Trans People","Chase Strangio, a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, claimed that Mario Lopez’s comments expressing concern about parents identifying children as young as three years old as transgender are “dangerous,” “damaging,” and could cause children to “die.”

However, Strangio also recently said on Twitter that The Guardian newspaper in the U.K. “is killing trans people,” in an apparent response to the article titled, “Politicised trans groups put children at risk, says expert: Counsellors and other mental health providers fear being labelled transphobic.” So it’s possible that when Strangio discusses death, Strangio may not be talking about death in the literal sense, much less in a way that constitutes credible medical advice.

The Guardian is killing trans people. — Chase Strangio (@chasestrangio) July 28, 2019

Aside from continuing to throw around an extremely flawed suicide statistic to terrify everyone out of questioning, and from the fact that data coming out of the U.K. indicates the medicalization of children’s personalities is itself dangerous, Strangio misstated some critical facts. Strangio writes, “No young child is receiving medical intervention of any kind before puberty and no one is receiving surgery until the age of 18 (except in some limited circumstances, where chest surgery might be available around age 16).”

Let’s take this claim in parts: first that there’s no surgery until the age of 18, with only some exceptions for chest surgery at 16. By chest surgery, Strangio likely means a double mastectomy performed on girls identifying as boys. This is the easiest part of the claim to address.

Dr. Johanna Olson Kennedy, whom Lopez’s producers at “Extra” brought on as a guest to address the controversy over his remarks, released a study last year reporting the survey results of trans-identified girls and young women who’d had double mastectomies while as young as 13 years old. Strangio either doesn’t know this — which would be odd considering Strangio’s position as a purported expert and national leader in gender identity litigation — or is misleading readers.

Olson Kennedy has also put some female patients into menopause at 14 years old with the endocrine treatments at her Los Angeles facility. While this isn’t surgery, Strangio likely wrote this article to allay fears that adults are treating minors with irreversible genital modifications. If that was Strangio’s intent, that is misleading readers. A combination of puberty blockers and/or cross-sex hormones, started at an early enough age and continuing through the natural adolescent development window, will sterilize a young person as surely as surgery.

Doctors don’t have to surgically remove children’s gonads to render them sterile. They can achieve sterility simply by performing thinly evidenced medical experiments on the endocrine systems of young people, all while these children are supposed to be going through ordinary adolescence. While Strangio’s answer was still incorrect on that point, the question of surgery is irrelevant to this issue.

Also, boys in the United States have been getting full genital reconfiguration surgeries as minors, and this has been widespread public knowledge since Jazz Jennings famously celebrated the removal of his penis with an inappropriate cake and a party for family and friends. Another 17-year-old boy appeared in the news for the same surgery just this July.

While it seems almost impossible that Strangio doesn’t know Jennings exists and had a surgery at age 17 that Strangio alleges “no one” is getting before the age of 18, this is quietly happening to more teen boys. A paper on an anonymized survey of doctors performing cosmetic genital surgeries reported that several said they’d operated on minor boys so that the boys’ parents could help them get used to the care schedule for their surgical wounds before they went off to college.

One such doctor said, “They are coming in after being put on blockers, so they have 11-year-old genitalia.” Another said, “You are really doing vaginoplasty on a micropenis.”

That is, medical professionals are putting 11-year-old boys on puberty blockers, a very serious medical intervention that can completely circumvent all the normal aspects of adolescent development and prevent all development of adult sexual function. This includes even the capacity to experience sexual pleasure.

The children get frustrated that they aren’t really growing up like their peers, and ask their doctors to do something about it. Then surgeons are flaying their childish “micropenises and testes,” perhaps without their ever having experienced so much as a wet dream, to give them a surgical cavity that will need to be dilated several times a day so it doesn’t collapse and heal over.

Please do not be more alarmed at my description of what is happening to these children than you are at the fact that it’s happening to children, in our country, at the hands of doctors, while progressives market it as “life-affirming care.”

Finally, we get to Strangio’s first and most slippery claim, that doctors are performing no medical interventions on children prior to puberty. The problem with this claim is that what gender activists call “affirmation,” which they increasingly want the government to require of all caregivers, is itself a consequential treatment.

When prominent doctors in gender identity medicine are telling other doctors and parents that toddlers and preverbal infants can send “gender messages,” then advise parents and other authority figures to reinforce in these children a belief that they’re really the opposite sex, this significantly affects young people. It makes it harder for them to desist from a desire to be the opposite sex, which no medical treatment can truly help them fulfill, in any case.

What used to happen when children were persistently unhappy in the stereotypical social roles of their sex is that most of them stopped being dysphoric. Until recently, very few such children presented at clinics with significant distress. Most of them were boys, and most grew out of it. Now many more children are presenting with this type of distress, most of them are girls, and most of them persist in their distress until an age where physical intervention is allowed, which most of them then demand.

This is an astounding switch to have occurred within the span of a generation. Further, given that sexologists have been studying and writing with great frankness about people who displayed variant sex role behavior — such as cross-dressing or taking on the social role of the opposite sex — for more than a century, it seems unlikely on its face that such a phenomenon would have been completely missed before our time.

The simpler explanation is that something odd is happening here. Given the seriousness of the medical interventions doctors are undertaking, that something needs much more discussion and scrutiny than it’s had to date.

Lopez was right to be worried about parents identifying toddlers as having been “born in the wrong body,” as the typical description goes. Everyone should worry about it, no matter how often demagogic ACLU staff lawyers launch into rants about how the slightest disagreement with them comprises actual murder.

5 Big Misconceptions About The Trump Administration’s LGBTQ Record,"Recently Ric Grenell, the openly gay U.S. ambassador to Germany, hosted a discussion in Berlin with international LGBTQ activists as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to decriminalize homosexuality around the world. More than 70 countries have laws against LGBTQ activities. Through economic influence, increasing education, and advocating policy changes, this important new global campaign hopes to change that.

Activists from countries such as Lebanon, Georgia, and Botswana shared their experiences and discussed the harrowing conditions LGBTQ individuals face in their nations. Grenell gave activists from the most affected countries a forum to develop better strategies to fight for LGBTQ policies and made it clear the United States would help in their struggle however it could.

The Trump administration also announced the appointment of another openly gay man, Robert Gilchrist, as the U.S. ambassador to Lithuania. If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Gilchrist could play a pivotal role in LGBTQ policy. His challenge will be to do this in a culturally conservative country that lags other nations in affirming LGBTQ desires.

There is a large potential political and cultural impact to our top diplomat in a country like Lithuania being a gay man. It sends a high-profile message that to have a good political and economic relationship with the United States, nations will need to accept LGBTQ individuals and improve treatment of their own LGBTQ citizens. It’s one more example of how the Trump administration is using soft-power and influence to carry out this important global initiative.

However, the dominant narrative weaved by the media and Democrats incorrectly paints the administration’s record on LGBTQ issues. The very same Advocate article on Gilchrist’s appointment still claims that overall, “the Trump administration has taken many anti-LGBTQ actions.” But has it?

As a gay man myself, it’s important to me to know how the facts measure up to these accusations. Below are the most notable allegations of anti-LGBTQ actions supposedly taken by the Trump administration, and whether the media and leftist politicians reported them accurately.

Myth 1: Trump Rescinded Obama Protections for LGBTQ Federal Employees

In the weeks leading up to Trump’s inauguration, Bloomberg and several LGBTQ outlets reported that Obama’s executive order protecting LGBTQ federal employees would be rescinded as soon as Trump took office. A December 5, 2016 article in The Advocate—a well-known LGBTQ publication—sounded the alarm that “Donald Trump has signaled that he plans to repeal federal protections for LGBT workers while in office.”

James Esseks, director of the LGBT program at the ACLU, warned: “Any attempt by the Trump administration to rescind or weaken Obama’s order would essentially be an effort to ‘authorize discrimination’ against gay and transgender people … The Trump administration has shown that it’s willing to go against core American values of freedom and equality, and it’s troubling to hear they may target LGBT people as well.”

A week after Trump’s inauguration, however, the White House released a statement reading, “President Donald J. Trump is determined to protect the rights of all Americans, including the LGBTQ community… The executive order signed in 2014, which protects employees from anti-LGBTQ workplace discrimination while working for federal contractors, will remain intact.”

Most of the media outlets that predicted doom and gloom never corrected the record. Unfortunately, many still believe the order protecting LGBTQ federal employees was rescinded.

Myth 2: The Trump Administration Removed LGBTQ People From the 2020 Census

The National LGBTQ Task Force proclaimed in a statement “We’ve Been Erased!” GLAAD Executive Director Sara Kate Ellis added, “By erasing LGBTQ Americans from the 2020 U.S. Census, the Trump Administration is adding a disgusting entry to a long list of tactics they’ve adopted to legally deny services and legitimacy to hard-working LGBTQ Americans.” The Daily Beast even ran an article with the headline “This Is Why the Erasing of LGBT Americans On the 2020 Census Matters,” accusing the Trump administration of “official prejudice.”

There’s only one problem with these accusations. “Are you a member of the LGBTQ community?” has never been a question asked on a U.S. census. Because social scientists know many “closeted” gay people would not accurately report their status, including such as question would fail to represent the true size of the LGBTQ population.

Gary Gates, a demographer and former member of the Census Bureau Scientific Advisory Committee, tried to correct the record by telling LGBTQ Nation, “Erasing implies that the Bureau went from measuring sexual orientation and gender identity in the Census to eliminating that measurement … it’s not accurate to suggest that the Census Bureau ‘erased’ them. They’ve never counted them in the first place.”

Additionally, many remember the federal government’s lackluster response to the AIDS crisis in the 1980s and society’s treatment of those infected still have concerns about being on some “gay government list.” Being added to the census would reignite those fears.

Being LGBTQ has never been a protected class under federal law, and many states don’t have laws defining LGBTQ persons as such either. As a result, many still feel they must live in the shadows. It’s likely that no matter who sits in the White House, this question will remain off the census for some time.

Myth 3: Trump Banned Transgender People From the Military

This one could be considered “partially true,” but it’s complicated. Even after the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy was lifted in 2011, a ban on being openly transgender in the military continued through the Obama administration into the first year of Trump’s presidency. Obama signed an executive order on June 30, 2016, that would have eventually allowed trans members to openly serve in the armed forces, but it was written to go into effect six months into the next administration. As the implementation deadline approached, Trump issued a halt.

After reviewing the implications, and discussions between Trump and then-Defense Secretary Gen. James Mattis, the policy that went into effect in March 2018 allowed for new and existing members to be trans as long as they don’t suffer from gender dysphoria or require transgender surgery after enlisting.

Ostensibly, if you are trans, and have already had (or won’t require) transgender surgery once you’re in uniform, you will likely be allowed to join or continue serving. Otherwise, it’s deemed a “military readiness” issue if you will require surgery down the road. It’s likely the military will not pay for hormone and other specific medications many trans individuals regularly require. So, while this is not a “ban” in the truest sense, good people could reasonably disagree on whether this is exclusionary towards trans individuals or a fair compromise.

The unfortunate truth is the public debate over trans issues is more recent than those issues that affect gay and lesbian individuals. This “half-way” policy reflects that. Trans policies may be the only area where the Trump administration has a mixed record regarding LGBTQ equality.

Myth 4: Trump’s Executive Order on Religious Freedom Allows LGBT Discrimination

Weeks before anyone knew what would be in Trump’s executive order on religious freedom, many in the media were speculating. In a Newsweek article, Lambda CEO Rachel Tiven stated, “[Trump’s] come for the immigrants, he’s come for the Muslims. and now he’s coming for the queers.” In reality, Trump’s decree does not give an exemption to religious groups to discriminate against gay people as a matter of conscience.

Some Christians were disappointed. One Christianity Today article lamented, “This is not the executive order many evangelicals had been praying for. Gone are the exemptions for religious groups faced with accommodating LGBT anti-discrimination regulations that conflict with their faith convictions.”

Once again, the record was not corrected by most media outlets. Buried within a misleadingly titled NBC article is one paragraph near the end that states, “While an earlier draft of the religious liberty order reportedly would have let federal contractors discriminate against LGBT employees based on faith beliefs, Thursday’s version did not include such provisions.” Unfortunately, that bit of truth and context was glossed over. As it never made any headlines, this fact remains mostly unknown.

Myth 5: Vice President Pence Supports Conversion Therapy

This accusation maybe the one used to scare LGBTQ people most often and most effectively. It was even reinforced on the NBC show “Will & Grace” when, in a recent episode, a main character’s grandson is sent to a gay-conversion therapy camp featuring a very large homage to Pence at the front of the building. Digs at Pence’s supposed support for the practice litter the entire episode.

In January 2018, the issue also made international headlines when Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon chided the White House for sending Pence to the Winter Olympics. When USA Today asked whether he would attend the traditional meeting with the V.P., as Pence requested, Rippon responded, “You mean Mike Pence, the same Mike Pence that funded gay conversion therapy? I’m not buying it.”

Did Pence do anything of the sort? The issue originates with a quotation on Pence’s 2000 congressional campaign website on the renewal of Ryan White HIV/AIDS funding. The quotation read, “Resources should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.” While it’s possible one could read that statement as an endorsement of conversion therapy, it’s much more likely be a statement of support for institutions that encourage condom use or the reduction of risky sexual behavior in general. Pence said so himself.

I won’t claim to know what’s in Pence’s heart on LGBTQ issues, but the fact is Pence is not on-record supporting conversation therapy and has never “funded it,” as Rippon accused. Yet almost 20 years later, much of the media is still peddling this falsehood.

Truth: The Trump Administration Has Notable LGBT Accomplishments

Lost among the sea of false accusations is that the Trump administration has done a lot for LGBTQ people. In addition to those previously noted, Trump has made several high-profile LGBTQ appointments, including R. Clark Cooper, assistant secretary of state.

The administration has worked constructively with Log Cabin Republicans, one of the oldest LGBTQ Republican groups, on critical federal court appointments. Last year, Trump nominated attorney Patrick Bumatay to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, and judge Mary Rowland to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Both are openly gay. Nikki Haley, Trump’s former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, used her platform to call attention to the atrocities committed against LGBTQ individuals in Chechnya and around the world.

This year, in a game-changing move in the fight against HIV and AIDS (whose sufferers are disproportionately LGBTQ), President Trump announced an ambitious initiative to end new HIV transmissions by 2030. President Trump negotiated a donation from Gilead, the pharmaceutical company that makes PrEP, the expensive drug that prevents HIV infections. Two hundred thousand individuals who are most at risk of infection will now receive free PrEP for the next 11 years.

Finally, there’s his record as a citizen. Trump supported same-sex civil unions back in a 2000 interview with The Advocate when most politicians in both political parties opposed them. He was one of the first club owners in the 1980s to allow openly gay people entry, then a violation of Florida law due to public panic over the AIDS crisis. He’s been friends with Elton John and numerous other openly gay celebrities throughout his entire life. Before being gay was considered “cool,” Trump already seemed cool with it.

While Trump may not be remembered as the president who authored the most pro-LGBTQ legislation, he also isn’t going to be remembered as the one who set us back. In Trump’s America, we are all Americans. We’re no longer defined or separated by being gay or straight. There is not a single thing I can’t do now in Trump’s America as a gay man that I could do in Obama’s.

Today in America, being a true advocate of equality is more complicated than supporting every bill that comes before a legislature deemed to be “pro-LGBTQ.” It means distinguishing between policies that are truly good and necessary for LGBTQ people, versus proposals that are simply about getting votes or raising the profile of one’s “advocacy” organization.

When Trump errs on LGBTQ policy, it’s fair to hold him accountable. By the same token, we should not assume that every LGBTQ organization or piece of legislation is actually good for LGBT people. We should feel just as compelled to find out the truth and hold media, politicians, and advocacy organizations accountable.

For decades, LGBTQ people were the victims of false, generalized media narratives used to marginalize us. If we continue to fall for the same lies without learning the truth for ourselves, we do a tremendous disservice to the decades of hard-fought equality we have worked so hard to achieve.

Anti-Discrimination No Help When Coworkers Targeted My LGBT Identity,"The topic of LGBT discrimination is overwhelmed by its own significance and the ease with which is it exploited. We know a majority of Americans oppose discrimination against LGBT people in the workplace. A recent study found 70 percent agree with this position.

The data, however, reveals significant disparities. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reports a 4.3 percent accuracy rate among reported anti-LGBT discrimination cases, while multiple self-reporting studies indicate between 1 in 4 and 1 in 5 LGBT Americans experience discrimination in the workplace annually. Of major companies, 91 percent have policies protecting LGBT employees. In all of this, perhaps there’s an opportunity to better understand how reporting works and what it means to face discrimination.

It is important to challenge what we think of as “discrimination.” I always expected the concept to involve direct and intentional unfair treatment toward otherwise qualified workers based solely on their characteristics or associations.

The left, on the other hand, tends to focus on what minority individuals believe they experienced at work. For example, a widely cited Center for American Progress report, which concluded 1 in 5 LGBT Americans had faced discrimination in the workplace, reported the following incident: David M., a gay man, works at a Fortune 500 company with a formal, written nondiscrimination policy. “I couldn’t be fired for being gay,” he said. But David then explained, “When partners at the firm invite straight men to squash or drinks, they don’t invite the women or gay men. I’m being passed over for opportunities that could lead to being promoted.”

The more reasonable of us tilt our heads with skepticism and conclude that no actual discrimination is occurring that the law could affect, and we dismiss the basis of the leftist argument. But what other ways can a person face unfair treatment based solely on who they are that could affect their work and career progress?

Until the past few months, I would likely have dismissed such a question. After 20 years of being gainfully employed, neither my sexuality nor my religious identity had ever negatively affected my working experience. But that changed dramatically in the most unexpected of ways.

Talking About Me But Not To Me

A few months ago, I was sitting in a committee meeting surrounded by more than a dozen other leaders, including several department directors, to discuss improving diversity within the hospital where we worked. One of those areas of improvement involved LGBT community inclusiveness, engagement, and safety.

As the only open LGBT member of leadership in the organization, I found myself the sole voice on much of the conversation. During one of these meetings, the issue of community outreach came up due to the organization’s low score on a coveted LGBT equality measure headed by the Human Rights Campaign.

For more than a year, I had been championing the idea that the hospital should be a central resource for HIV testing, treatment, and support for a community devastated by the opioid epidemic. Since I am open about my HIV experience, this was not a new or shocking statement to most of the people in the room, but one member, a director, still strongly objected.

She expressed concern that more HIV awareness and visible LGBT-inclusive messaging from the hospital would send many patients away for fear they might be infected by the disease. Using a remarkably dismissive and judgmental tone, she declared she would be uncomfortable if knowing she was in a hospital room where “people like that” had recently been.

I suppressed my desire to loudly say she was sitting in a room with a “person like that” right now, but my professionalism was betrayed by the shaking of my hands as I pretended to take notes and the deep reddish shade of my skin as I tried to hide my disgust, humiliation, and anger. Another influential leader interrupted by arguing he had not chosen to join the committee to discuss “this stuff” and would simply leave if we did not move on to more relevant topics.

I was, to put it as politely as possible, floored by the experience. Everyone in the room knew the comments were targeting me, and not a single one spoke up, including the director of human resources, who was leading the meeting.

I spoke about this to my direct supervisor, who advised me simply to let it go, and my co-workers advised the same. I considered simply resigning from the committee to avoid further hostility. I felt that even with my brand of conservative moderation in approaching this particular topic, it was still far too controversial to discuss openly.

For the first time in three years of working at the hospital, I felt intimidated, and desired simply to blend in rather than to be a prominent voice. I avoided committee members and I noticed, with growing frustration, that no one on the HR team attempted to reach out to me to follow up on the experience — despite my prior email communications offering resources and literature on LGBT policy in health care and my offer to run an employee LGBT meeting to address concerns. More noticeably, the other committee members openly avoided me as well.

I Tried To Take Action

The stress of the experience affected my health, and I realized the weight of what I had experienced was heavier than I wanted to admit. As a person who prides himself on tolerance and being particularly resistant to what others consider offensive, I was embarrassed and humiliated.

I finally chose to report the incident. That typically involves discussing the issue with a supervisor, which I had done, then reporting it to human resources. Considering the HR director was a witness in the incident and had done nothing, that option was not available to me. My position aligned with senior leadership, so I chose to reach out directly to the CEO of the organization, who promptly launched an investigation.

The investigation took two weeks, during which my anxiety skyrocketed. As people were interviewed, their tension toward me became more noticeable, and I found myself unable to engage in my normal professional duties. The last step in the process was an “insight” meeting, in which lawyers and my VP were expected to clarify any questions. Instead, it became a discussion about how my own sensitivity was creating a hostile work environment.

I left the meeting feeling embarrassed, defeated, and wishing I had never said anything. While the individuals were kind and empathetic, it became clear nothing was going to come of the process and even more clear that my career in that organization had dropped sharply. Personal circumstances related to my mother’s health offered me an opportunity to resign with dignity, but the realization of what I had brought upon myself was staggering.

The next logical step, as many advised, was to file a lawsuit. To do so, I had to file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission within 90 days of the incident. I was already at the 60-day mark.

The federal commission offers several options to report different types of incidents, and my experience fell within two of them. West Virginia does not have laws protecting LGBT status in employment, but the Americans with Disabilities Act does protect, nationwide, people living with HIV. The process to report discrimination for HIV involved writing a letter, and the process for LGBT discrimination involved submitting a form. I chose the form.

We Need a New LGBT Discrimination Conversation

It was difficult to summarize what I had experienced in less than 1,000 characters, but I managed and submitted my claim. This first step was a screening. I must attend an interview before being permitted to file a complaint. The closest office for that was six hours away from me in Pittsburgh, and the soonest the people there could see me was mid-October.

Their assumption that I would continue working in the environment until a screening interview three months away was absurd and distressing. Knowing my employer would be immediately informed of the complaint once the interview was approved was even more so. The process made me feel vulnerable and very much alone.

I could not help but imagine what it must feel like for someone in a frontline position within the organization. Here I was, someone with direct access to the CEO, and I walked away feeling humiliated and overwhelmed. The closest resource was months away. So I chose to walk away and start over.

As I have found repeatedly in my life, the conservative community stepped up to help me, offering generosity and compassion. Raising money to buy my necessary medications and rebuild my life gave me hope and a way forward. Following the rules, guidelines, and legal processes had only disabled me and conditioned me never to speak up again if I found myself in a similar situation.

Although abuses and exploitation of discrimination policy is a very real concern, and legal efforts to nationalize protections may or may not be effective in helping people such as myself who experience genuine workplace discomfort, there is an important conversation here. What should be done when people are reduced to their characteristics in their own workplace?

What purpose do expansive anti-discrimination policies serve if they have no reasonable enforcement? What is the line between an experience such as my own and religious freedom and autonomy? The offender in my situation cited the rights of Christians in her opposition, for example.

The issue is more complicated than simply comparing studies and policies. The personal, social, and even physical effects on individuals, as I realized, is even more devastating. What is the point of further government programs designed to fight this very issue, paid by the taxpayers, if this is the painstaking process that results? After this experience, I believe we must have a much larger conversation across all sides of the issue, and a fresh approach to addressing it.

"Buttigieg Exposes Dems’ ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ Approach To Black Voters","In recent polling, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg attracts roughly 1 percent of black voters. One explanation for this is low name recognition. Yet there is reason to think Buttigieg’s same-sex marriage may be problematic to one degree or another with this key Democratic demographic. Democrats and the establishment media would prefer not to discuss it.

It is too early to say definitively that Buttigieg has a problem with black voters. At this point in the campaign, when polling Democrats about Democrats, favorability ratings tend to be inversely related to “don’t know / no opinion” responses.

Low name identification becomes a larger problem when attempting to analyze sub-samples such as of black voters. In early August, 62 percent of black Democratic primary voters in Morning Consult’s tracking survey did not know who Buttigieg is. Accordingly, we should not jump to conclusions about his potential appeal to black voters.

On the other hand, blacks in early primary and caucus states are learning about Mayor Pete. Some of what they are learning may not be appealing on the issues, such as his admission of failure in diversifying South Bend’s police department. Black voters are also learning about his sexuality; some are not thrilled with it.

In South Carolina, the first primary state with a significant black population and one likely to be decisive in the voting, black churchgoers have mixed feelings about Buttigieg’s homosexuality. Joe Darby, a pastor in the African Methodist Episcopal Church and local NAACP leader, told the Associated Press: “It’s a heavy lift in the black church. Just as nobody who is racist likes to say, ‘I’m a racist,’ nobody who is homophobic in the black community likes to say, ‘I’m homophobic.’” Darby later added, “The most damning comment was at a clergy breakfast, and when his name was brought up another guy said, ‘Yeah, that’s the guy who kissed his husband on TV.’”

Black Americans’ attitudes about Buttigieg are not monolithic. The AP also interviewed congregants at a Baptist church in Greenville who dismissed Mayor Pete’s perceived sin. Others were simply willing to vote for him if he had the right politics and could beat President Trump. Even in these opinions, however, there is the sense that Buttigieg’s sexuality may be an obstacle among churchgoing black voters.

These interviews are anecdotes, but they are consistent with broader data. The most recent Pew Research Center polling indicates only 44 percent of black Protestants support same-sex marriage, the same level of support found among Republicans and leaners (the figure for Democrats and leaners is 75 percent).

Overall, blacks lag other racial demographics in supporting same-sex marriage. A bare 51 percent majority of blacks support same-sex marriage, as opposed to 58 percent of Latinos and 62 percent of whites. These numbers suggest Buttigieg may have difficulties attracting black support even if he becomes better known among voters generally.

While black attitudes on LGBTQ issues pose a particular problem for Mayor Pete, his candidacy exposes a more general issue for a Democratic Party whose elites are disproportionately white leftists. The elite response so far, including from establishment media, has been to bury the issue.

For example, three Democratic presidential candidates—Sens. Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Cory Booker—campaigned at the Victory Missionary Baptist Church in Las Vegas. The church is led by the Rev. Robert E. Fowler, Sr., who believes being gay is “enough to send you to hell.” Fowler also has compared homosexuality to child molestation, which apparently caught Harris completely unaware:

Harris says she was not aware of the Nevada pastor’s homophobic comments before speaking at his church (Booker and Sanders have also spoken there) pic.twitter.com/CJbQt2C56m — Christopher Cadelago (@ccadelago) August 8, 2019

Eventually, all three candidates issued statements distancing themselves from the pastor. The story was covered by outlets that serve an LGBTQ audience or have significant LGBTQ readership, such as DC’s Metro Weekly, The Advocate, and the Mercury News. No more than a handful of center-left outlets touched it.

In contrast, everyone knows how the story would have been covered if the candidates had been Republican. In the first instance, Republicans get more scrutiny for campaigning in churches than Democrats ever have. In the second instance, the media would have swarmed Buttigieg for comment.

Furthermore, Mitt Romney’s faith, the Mormon religion’s position on LGBTQ rights, and the antipathy of some conservative preachers to Mormonism were media fodder for two consecutive campaign cycles. In 2008, the establishment media made the anti-Catholic, anti-Semitic pastor John Hagee’s endorsement of Sen. John McCain a story for months after McCain made clear he did not endorse Hagee.

Most recently, during an interview on an unrelated topic, CNN’s Don Lemon ambushed a pro-Trump pastor regarding his 2012 statement comparing same-sex marriage to child molestation. CNN was missing in action regarding the Fowler’s similar comment, let alone the three Democratic candidates who campaigned in his church.

Mayor Pete’s candidacy throws a spotlight on the relative social conservatism of black Democrats on LGBTQ issues, but the difference is not limited to that topic. Nonwhite Democrats are also relatively more conservative on Israel, the Me Too movement and other issues.

The party’s leftist elites seemingly have adopted a “don’t ask, don’t tell” approach with its social conservatives. So far, it’s working. There is little social conservatism among the 2020 candidates; there is no sign that nonwhite Democrats are abandoning the party in any significant number.

But the fact that Democrats tolerate socially conservative nonwhites—so long as they keep their mouths shut and vote for leftists—will not go unnoticed by the right in an election cycle where the Democrats plan to campaign on their supposed moral superiority and enlightenment regarding social issues.

Activists Vilify Pastor Arrested For Enacting Plot Of Celebrated Gay Movie,"Back in 2017, Queerty, a prominent LGBT news and advocacy site, gleefully shared a recut of the trailer for the award-winning movie, “Call Me By Your Name,” featuring clips from Disney’s “Monster’s University.” In 2018, on the site Dan Tracer lamented that explicit sex scenes between the two main characters, a 17-year-old boy and a 24-year-old man, were cut from the main release.

Describing the decision, Tracer wrote, “James Ivory, who won the Oscar for writing the film’s screenplay, says his original script called for full-frontal from both the film’s two stars. Both Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer’s contracts, however, nixed that plan.”

Controversy had already been swirling around the movie based on the adult-teen romantic relationship when James Woods scolded one of the main characters, Armie Hammer, for promoting that relationship. Queerty referred to this as “homophobic.” When challenged, Hammer simply waved away criticism, arguing that “in most U.S. states, the age of consent is 16. In Italy, where the movie takes place, the age of consent is 14; it was also 14 in 1983, when the movie is set.”

Struggling with the ethics of the movie, Slate writer Jeffrey Bloomer concluded his review of the movie, lamenting, “It’s not reasonable to say the movie endorses pedophilia, or really any kind of power-based abuse, just because it depicts that relationship. If we go down that censorious and unnuanced path with our art, very little will survive the trip.”

With the movie’s incredible praise from the LGBT media, and the media at large, it would seem the left considers a 24-year-old man and a teenage boy engaging in a sexual and romantic relationship to be positive and empowering. But this view sharply ends when a competing social narrative enters the story.

A Double Standard About Underage Sex

Reporting on the story of a fired and criminally charged youth pastor, Queerty tweeted, “Antigay youth pastor busted from sexting teen boy, asking for x-rated pics,” with mugshot photos of the 24-year-old man charged. The article begins saying, “Another day, another antigay preacher busted for being a pervert. This time it’s Paxton Singer, a former youth pastor at Harvest Bible Chapel in Aurora, Illinois, who allegedly asked a 16-year-old boy to send him nude pics and sneak away with him for a weekend alone together.”

Another young man, who was 17 at the time, told police of an inappropriate relationship with Singer. Singer was indicted for sexual exploitation in 2018, and his trial is set to begin in September.

So it seems a same-sex, adult-teen relationship is either a beautiful expression of LGBT progress or an example of perversion deserving of jail time, depending entirely on whether or not the adult involved is a Christian. It is common for LGBT media to revel in humiliating Christian leaders who are secretly gay by exposing them.

The article does not specify what qualifies the former youth pastor as being “anti-gay,” and glosses over the fact that the church fired him and reported him to the authorities immediately upon learning of his actions. But none of that matters. The story here is that an “anti-gay” pastor was humiliated as a hypocrite.

In a Washington Examiner article, “Why is LGBT media normalizing quasi-pedophilia?,” writer Brad Polumbo describes the relationship between a 55-year-old man and a 22-year-old man who met when the younger was 17, and argues, “Rather, it’s the disturbing attempt to ‘normalize’ 30-year age gaps that involve a middle-aged man preying on a teenage boy and possibly paying him for sex.” The younger man defended himself, saying, “I’d recommend for you to keep your mind open and know that love comes in many shapes, forms, sizes, colours, and ages.”

The leftist LGBT movement seems unable to decide if it approves.

Exploiting Minors Is the Real Problem

There are deep issues in the gay male community about this type of relationship. In 2017, the top gay porn search word, for example, was “daddy.” The Advocate titled a guide for younger men, “29 Things You Should Look for in a Daddy: It takes a lot more than bedroom prowess to make a happy and healthy daddy-son relationship.”

In Queerty, the same author referring to the former youth pastor as “perverted” wrote an article titled, “PHOTOS: Gay Daddies And Their Sexy Sons Together On Father’s Day.” Yet another Queerty article is titled, “Six Pro Tips For Being The Best Daddy For Your Boy.” The language, the culture, the fetishized sub-culture, and so on fixate on the specific idea of adult men and teenage boys engaging sexually.

While most of the criticism is dismissed as discomfort with “age-gaps” within relationships, the issue is the cultural celebration of the exploitation of teenage boys who are incapable of making adult decisions. More to the point, if the LGBT community is so determined to expose Christian hypocrisy related to sexuality, it severely needs to address its own.

There is simply no argument that society should tolerate Singer’s immoral and illegal activity. But how can one man be criminally prosecuted and another celebrated on the front of LGBT websites for identical behavior?

The left is always balancing between indignation and hypocrisy. In this particular situation, however, they should stick to their instincts regarding Singer’s behavior and apply it to all adult-teenage relationships.

As “Queer Eye” star and psychologist Karamo Brown argued regarding “Call Me By Your Name,” “I know we’re calling [Oliver] a college student, but it looks like a grown man having sex with a little boy,” he added. “And for me, I just was not OK with that. And I was like, ‘Why are we pretending like this is OK in any sense, fashion, or form?’” He continued, “But there is predatory behavior there that I see, especially in the movie, where Armie Hammer looks dramatically older than this young man.”

And he is correct. Whether the predator is a closeted youth pastor or a handsome and charming character in a romance novel, it should simply be universally accepted that he has no business pursuing teenage boys. All the indignation the left feels toward the idea of a hypocritical “anti-gay” pastor, they should channel toward the exploitation of all minors, regardless of who the abuser is.

The hatred of Christianity within the LGBT community overshadows the real issue at hand. What matters is that an adult preyed on vulnerable minors, and the same people shaming him are celebrating this type of behavior openly in media, pornography, and social progress — as long as they approve of the politics of the people involved.

"If You Don't Agree With Taylor Swift, She Turns From 'Lover' To Hater","Popular figures are just as capable of “jumping the shark” as TV shows and movies, and it’s official: Taylor Swift has crossed that line and left it in her rear-view mirror.

I grew up with Taylor Swift. I was her target audience. My sisters and I bought her albums as soon as they came out, and I memorized every line she ever sang. I was, to put it lightly, a fan.

Swift released her new album, “Lover,” on Aug. 23. With it, any warm and fuzzy feelings I had about her were gone. She openly bashed conservative politics, took up cliched complaints about white privilege, and began selling bubble gum pop with tinny, insincere lyrics.

I’m done. We are never, ever, ever getting back together.

Some of my best memories include Swift. My friends and I drove through the mountains in the Shenandoah blasting “22.” My first heartbreak could be summed up by “Dear John.” I knew no level of sadness a Swift song couldn’t help.

Where are all those relatable lyrics and emotions now? Maybe I outgrew Taylor, but maybe she left me out in the cold. And maybe our differences have something to do with her newfound political activism.

Taylor Swift Loves Partisanship More Than Her Audience

In the era of political division, Taylor is embracing partisanship in a big way. “Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince,” with lines like “We’re so sad, we paint the town blue,” sounds like it was written to be a Democratic campaign song. “This song is about disillusionment with our crazy world of politics and inequality, set in a metaphorical high school,” she said in an explanation on Spotify.

This isn’t her first crack at activism. She wrote in 2018 that she could not support Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn because “I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender, or who they love. These are not MY Tennessee values.”

So instead of supporting the woman running for office, Taylor threw her support behind the straight, white, cisgender male in the race: Democrat Phil Bredesen. (He lost.) That move doesn’t quite align with a quote from Taylor’s latest interview with Vogue, where she claimed, “Rights are being stripped from basically everyone who isn’t a straight white cisgender male.”

Speaking of males, track four of “Lover,” “The Man,” is a fantasy of what life would be like if Taylor were a man. This concept forgets one key factor in her mythos: If she were a man, she probably wouldn’t be a pop star.

More importantly, Taylor is denying that femininity is a part of her. There’s a level of envy here that is completely misplaced. The reason we all loved Swift when we were young was that she fearlessly embraced her identity. Strong women don’t do what the rest of the world tells them to do. Strong women have feelings and aren’t afraid to share them. Strong women don’t care about the haters — they shake them off.

Pledging Allegiance for Profit

So far the public hasn’t thought of Swift as the first person at a pride parade. But the girl who used to be known for singing about heartbreak wants to reinvent herself as an LGBTQ icon. Her “gay anthem,” released in time for Pride Month, told everyone they “need to calm down,” and they’re “being too loud.” She chided the right for speaking up and being heard over her echo chamber.

This move might appeal to LGBTQ activists, but what about the rest of her fans? We were there when she was a shy, awkward teenager singing about Joe Jonas letting her down. We stood by when everyone criticized her for not making political statements in the whirlwind of 2016. We bought her albums when she refused to put them on Spotify.

Swift’s new, politicized strategy isn’t working. Even LGBTQ people are questioning whether Taylor is just trying to profit by pledging allegiance to them. After the release of “You Need to Calm Down,” a Daily Beast article said her lyrics sounded like “attempts at being woke that read more like the ramblings of a cringey relative who’s watched one episode of Drag Race.” Ouch.

Frankly, Swift’s political themes throughout the album are awkward, misplaced, and depressing. She sings, “American stories burning before me/ I’m feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed.” Taylor, you need to calm down.

The fact is, Taylor Swift is not suffering. She has a net worth of $360 million. There is no need for her to feel helpless when she has so much money that she can buy her way out of anything.

Taylor Swift fans aren’t 15 anymore. We’ve grown up. Maybe she should grow up with us.

Rashida Tlaib Blames Israel For Terrorist Attack That Killed Israeli Teen,"On Saturday evening, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., tweeted her sadness about the terrorist bombing that took the life of 17-year-old Israeli Rina Shnerb. Shnerb was hiking with her brother and father at the Ein Bubin Spring in the West Bank on August 23 when a bomb was “triggered remotely when [Rina’s] family approached it.” Rina’s brother and father were injured in the attack.

Palestinian-American Tlaib’s tweet took a rapid shift from emotional outpouring to launching guilt at Israel: “More than ever,” she wrote, “we need to support nonviolent approaches to ending the Israeli occupation and guaranteeing equal rights for all. Extremism that puts innocent lives at risk moves us no closer to peace.”

As did the organization whose statement she retweeted, Tlaib implied that policies of the Jewish state of Israel were somehow to blame for the heinous actions of terrorists who detonated a bomb. It was hardly a surprising turn of events for the freshman representative, who often uses her public bullhorn to spread anti-Israel propaganda and bad Holocaust history.

Terrorist organization Hamas called the bombing “proof of the vitality and bravery of the Palestinian people.” According to the Israel Defense Forces, Palestinians celebrated Rina’s death by passing out candies.

August Has Been a Deadly Month

Perhaps Tlaib is not aware that Shnerb’s murder was only the most recent attack against Israelis in what has been a deadly month for America’s ally. Israel and its policies are no more to blame for the death of Shnerb than they are for this month’s series of cowardly attacks.

On August 7, 18-year-old yeshiva student Dvir Sorek was stabbed to death by two Palestinian men in the Etzion settlement in the West Bank. According to the Israeli army, the two men may have attempted to kidnap Sorek, and killed him in their vehicle before throwing him onto the street. When Sorek’s body was discovered, he was still clutching the books he had just purchased in Jerusalem. They were meant to be gifts for his teachers.

After Sorek’s death, the Palestinian Authority (PA) passed out candy in celebration, while leaders called Sorek’s murder “‘a heroic operation’ and ‘a natural response to the Israeli occupation’s crimes.’” Visible during Sorek’s solemn funeral service was a display of fireworks from Palestinians celebrating Sorek’s death in a nearby village.

On August 11, Tisha B’Av, a Jewish fast day, coincided with Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha, leading to a confrontation at the al-Aqsa Mosque, also known as the Temple Mount, in Jerusalem’s Old City. After an Eid al-Adha prayer, thousands of Muslims moved toward the Mughrabi Gate, the only gate non-Muslims may use to approach the Temple Mount, and began “throwing rocks and other objects at police.”

Israeli police used “dispersal means,” including tear gas, to respond to the riot, injuring 61 Muslims involved. Four members of the Israeli police were also wounded during the event. Contrary to fact, the spokesman of the PA President Mahmoud Abbas claimed that Israeli police had “storm[ed] the al-Aqsa Mosque and act[ed] aggressively against worshippers.”

On August 15, video captured a horrific terror attack near the Shalshelet Gate in the Old City, in which two Palestinian teens ran towards an Israeli police officer and began to stab him. Other officers at the scene fired on the teens, killing one. The second attacker was sent to the hospital, as was the officer, who had sustained a chest wound.

On August 16, near the Elazar settlement in the West Bank, a Palestinian Fatah member who had previously been jailed for acts of terror rammed a stolen car into two Israeli siblings. The 17-year-old brother, who suffered a fractured skull, underwent neurosurgery, and was sedated and on a respirator the day after the attack. His 19-year-old sister experienced injuries to her limbs.

Blame the Palestinian Authority’s ‘Pay for Slay’

If Tlaib is concerned about the impetus of the act of terror that killed Shnerb, she should look first to the PA, which offers incredible monetary incentives to Palestinians who launch such despicable terrorist attacks on Israelis.

In a policy known as “pay for slay,” the PA motivates attacks against Israeli “occupiers” by paying the perpetrators and their families a monthly stipend. “The more egregious the crime,” according to an op-ed from The Hill, “the more you get paid. Campsites, schools, clinics are named after so-called martyrs who kill innocent Jews.”

Every year, the PA pays out more than $330 million, or 7 percent of its budget, to those who attack Israelis. These funds, as explained in a January 2019 Washington Examiner op-ed, are distributed to “approximately 10,500 imprisoned and released prisoners and some 37,500 families of martyrs and injured.” In comparison, the PA’s welfare budget of $214 million is distributed between “118,000 households: a much larger group subsisting on a much smaller budget.”

In his description of the motivators for “pay for slay,” Army Lt. Col. Charles Faint mentions the 2004 law providing these payments. According to this law, the funds are provided for those “participating in the struggle against the occupation,” as they are “an integral part of the fabric of the Arab-Palestinian society.” Faint notes that “struggles” can involve anything “from throwing rocks to murdering American tourists.”

Here Faint refers to American Taylor Force, a Vanderbilt University student and former Army officer who was stabbed to death in Jaffa in 2016 while visiting Israel with his fellow graduate students. A West Bank political group referred to Force’s killer as “a ‘heroic martyr,’ and instituted payments to his family.”

Prior to 2018, Faint states the United States distributed around $300 million to the PA each year. With the passage of the Taylor Force Act in March 2018, all U.S. aid to the PA, except for some humanitarian funds, will cease until “pay for slay” is discontinued. Other countries, such as Australia and Israel, have followed suit.

Even as donor countries considered pulling funds from the PA, however, Abbas defended “pay for slay,” saying the program fulfilled “a social responsibility to look after innocent people affected by the incarceration or killing of their loved ones.”

Other Lies Tlaib Spreads about Israel

On Saturday, Tlaib called for a state that would guarantee “equal rights for all.” The 120-member body of the Knesset, Israel’s House of Representatives, includes 5 LGBTQ members, 12 non-Jews, and 29 women.

In comparison, earlier this month, the PA “banned LGBTQ organizations from operating in the West Bank,” stating LGBTQ events “go against and infringe upon the higher principles and values of Palestinian society.” While a Palestinian news agency claimed in 2018 that a single member of the Palestinian National Council, Uri Davis, is Jewish, Davis converted back to Islam in 2008.

Once considered fringe and hateful beliefs, Tlaib’s statements now get unprecedented air time and are becoming normalized.

Tlaib regularly makes false and dangerous allegations about Israel, like remarking on the country’s alleged “racism and…international human rights violations,” likening Israel to “the apartheid in South Africa,” and conflating Palestinians’ fight against Israel with the American fight for civil rights.

Once considered fringe and hateful beliefs, Tlaib’s statements now get unprecedented air time and are becoming normalized. Countering such drivel with facts seems to be a full-time occupation. Luckily, groups like the Anti-Defamation League methodically and factually counter these types of flawed allegations so Americans can readily educate themselves about the types and varieties of antisemitic attacks launched at our ally with increasing force and regularity.

While Tlaib’s sorrow about Shnerb’s death appears real, the representative must recognize how the falsehoods she spreads help to delegitimize, demonize, and disenfranchise the Jewish state of Israel. The words she uses to blame Israel for the actions of terrorists are not unlike the words of those who claim Israel is the aggressor while paying terrorists handsomely to conduct attacks against innocent Israelis.

If our congresswoman continues to offer a shallow, one-sided truths about the Israel-Palestine conflict and fails to address the PA’s “pay to slay” laws, or the cult of “heroic martyrdom” granted to those who kill Israelis, then it is the duty of every American who supports Israel to learn the truth and speak up loudly against Tlaib’s emotionally charged lies.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/08/27/rashida-tlaib-blames-israel-terrorist-attack-killed-israeli-teen/,2019-08-27
How Shoving Trans Preferences Into Law Will Undermine LGBT Rights,"On August 16, the Human Rights Campaign denounced the Trump administration for giving a “green light” to discriminate against transgender workers by interpreting federal law such that “sex” means biological sex instead of gender identity. The Obama administration had done the opposite, and was reversed after Donald Trump became president.

HRC Legal Director Sarah Warbelow said of pending litigation against this return to pre-Obama legal understandings, “There can be no justification for such a narrow interpretation of the term ‘sex.’ Our community will not be silent, and we will not be erased.” The issue revolves around Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The administration has argued, “Title VII prohibits treating an individual less favorably than similarly situated individuals of the opposite sex,” but does not specifically separate gender identity from biological sex.

This coming October, the Supreme Court is set to review three cases that could determine how future federal law handles discrimination protections for LGBT workers. HRC’s comments regard a case in which a male employee was fired as the employee moved from wearing male clothing to wearing female clothing at work.

The case, EEOC v. Harris Funeral Homes, is complicated. It involves policies based on biological sex as well as concerns over religious freedom.

From 2003 until 2013, Harris Funeral Homes employed a person who now prefers the name Aimee Stephens. Beginning as an apprentice, Stephens worked up to becoming funeral director and embalmer before choosing to identify as the opposite sex. According to the complaint, several weeks after Stephens informed Harris that Stephens would appear at work in female clothing, the employer chose to terminate Stephens’ contract.

The owners were concerned that Stephens would now be sharing the home’s single-sex bathroom with female employees and clients. Additionally, as Stephens would now be dressing in female clothing while still possessing masculine physical features (Stephens had not undergone any surgery), the owners felt Stephens’ appearance distracted grieving families and undermined their religious values. Ownership felt “there is no way that” Ms. Stephens “would be able to present in such a way that it would not be obvious that it [Stephens] was [a man].”

The briefing states that Harris owner “Rost has stated that he “believe[s] that the Bible teaches that a person’s sex is an immutable God-given gift,” and he would “violat[e] God’s commands” by “permit[ting] one of [Harris Homes’] funeral directors to deny their sex while acting as a representative of [the] organization” or by permitting a funeral director of either sex to “wear the uniform for” funeral directors of the opposite sex “at work.” The legal argument is that, because Stephens complied with the regulations for male and female dress and identifies as a woman, what took place was discrimination based on sex.

The case is one of several that LGBT advocates hope will broaden the definition of sex within civil rights law to include gender identity. The Washington Blade described the briefing this way: “the Trump administration urged the Supreme Court late Friday to issue a ruling that federal civil rights law doesn’t cover discrimination based on gender identity, therefore firing workers for being transgender is perfectly legal.”

While a strong case can be made that this funeral home discriminated against a long-term employee based exclusively on that employee’s transgender behavior, the argument that this violates “sex discrimination” is problematic. As the briefing argued, “Here, Harris Funeral Homes would have responded to a female employee who insisted on dressing as a man while working with grieving families the same way it responded to Stephens. Because it does not disfavor one sex compared to the other, Harris does not discriminate based on sex.”

Yet, as Harris’ brief makes clear,

At all times, Harris has administered its dress code based on biological sex, not gender identity. Stephens does not challenge the dress code itself. Instead, Stephens says that it constitutes sex discrimination to apply a dress code based on biological sex rather than an employee’s internal sense of gender. Before this case, neither Tom nor Harris had been accused of workplace discrimination of any kind.

One could argue that preventing female employees from wearing clothing the owner thinks resembles “dressing as a man” could qualify as sex discrimination. If Stephens’ appearance had resembled traditionally male attire, it is also possible the owner’s religious objection would have resulted in the same outcome. The owner of Harris Funeral Home disputes this, saying he would have not have reached the same decision had Stephens “continued to conform to the dress code for male funeral directors while at work,” and that there would have been a similar issue if a female employee had refused to conform to the different female-specific dress code requirements.

The issue is whether LGBT advocates will accept a legal definition of “sex” and “gender identity” as distinct. If they choose to combine the two into a singular concept, then much of their advocacy for transgender rights and gay and lesbian legal protections will be severely undermined—so too would nearly all legal victories won for women. As detailed in an article titled, “The Equality Act Would Lead to the Death of Women’s Rights,” women’s rights are defined exclusively by their physical separation from men and the historically unfair treatment that many believe was the result of those physical differences.

In the same way, gays and lesbians fought for the law to treat two men or two women the same as one man and one woman. If gender identity overrides biological sex, there is no longer a legal case for “same-sex” protections or legal distinctions.

This would also put transgender rights at risk, as both medical transition and access to sex-segregated spaces require a distinct concept of biological sex. The pertinent question is how the law recognizes employee rights while someone becomes transgender, and if employers must accommodate gender expression in the workplace.

An adult has the legal right to modify his or her body with tattoos, piercings, hairstyles, and clothing choices in any way he or she chooses. Yet businesses also have the right to dictate dress codes for employees. But can an employer legally dictate a dress code for men and women and then discriminate against employees who technically follow those guidelines—except for the opposite sex?

The upcoming SCOTUS fights over these issues is about more than just employment law and LGBT protections. The outcome of this battle will affect many Americans.

The Trump administration clearly states that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not include “gender identity” as protected under the word “sex.” The briefing states, “In 1964, the ordinary public meaning of ‘sex’ was biological sex. It did not encompass transgender status, which Stephens and the Sixth Circuit describe as a disconnect between an individual’s biological sex and gender identity.” Any change to this definition would require Congress to modify the definition of “sex” to include “gender identity” and so far, Congress hasn’t done so.

Where this all leads will be heavily influenced by the decisions provided by the Supreme Court on the issue. Until then, LGBT advocates should organize arguments about transgender employment protections separately from sex-based protections. Doing so will likely lead to better legal results that will not harm such a large swath of the population. Most LGBT advocates, however, seem bent on using the law to forcibly change the culture rather than just fighting to fill what they believe to be gaps in legal protections for LGBT Americans.

What People Who Used To Be Transgender Are Telling SCOTUS,"The Supreme Court will hear a pivotal case in October on sex, gender identity, and discrimination: R.G. and G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. As both sides build their cases, numerous influential organizations and individuals have filed amicus (friend of the court) briefs to aid the members of the Supreme Court in their understanding on this topic.

One brief in particular stands out. It’s so powerful, it should not only persuade the Supreme Court but influence people on both sides of the transgender debate, particularly the mainstream media.

There Is No Such Thing as Gender Fluidity

The brief examines the personal testimonies of the following people, all of whom identified as transgender at one point, then reverted to affirming their sex: Walt Heyer, Jamie Shupe, Linda Seiler, Hacsi Horvath, Clifton Francis Burleigh Jr., Laura Perry, Jeffrey Johnston, Jeffrey McCall, and Kathy Grace Duncan. While regular Federalist readers may be familiar with regular contributor Heyer, the other names may be unfamiliar. Yet their stories are just as powerful.

For starters, each of these people now believes, due to counseling, therapy, and personal experiences, that there is no such thing as gender fluidity or transgender. They now believe it is a fantasy many people try to make real.

Take Shupe, American’s first person to secure legal recognition of a nonbinary, transgender identity. He is a former hero of the left. His transgenderism “became the driver for over a dozen states to adopt an X marker in addition to male and female on driver licenses.” He first identified as a “transgender woman,” then as nonbinary.

The brief reads, “Publicly acknowledging that he is male and that his sex changes were a legal fiction has led to Mr. Shupe being shamed by the LGBTQ community for his beliefs that sex is binary and that those who struggle with gender identity issues need therapy and compassion, not to identify as a third gender.”

Laura Perry is a former female to male transgender person who underwent hormone treatment and a double mastectomy. “Ms. Perry enjoyed the transition process at first, and she entered into a relationship with another transgender individual,” says the brief. “They attended LGBT events together but stopped when the members of the community developed hatred for her partner who was conservative. They viewed her partner as a ‘traitor.’ Ms. Perry and her partner also claim that ‘we thought these people are the most depressed people in the world,’ referring to the LGBT community. Soon after, Ms. Perry became aware of the fact that changing sex is not biologically possible, and that sex is binary.”

Toward the end of Heyer’s story, the brief says, “For more than ten years Mr. Heyer has informally mentored and assisted scores of persons identifying as transgender who regret changing their appearance to that of the opposite sex. He encourages those who contact him who have gender dysphoria to seek psychological and psychiatric assessment for other disorders that are also present, which is the case in a majority of those who desire to identify as persons of the opposite sex.”

These claims fly in the face of what many on the left, including the transgender person on the other side of this particular Supreme Court case, say. To make matters worse, the media have also attacked former transgender people and ridiculed their stories as unreal.

Becoming Transgender Hurts More Than It Helps

Almost every single person in the brief said they stopped being transgender with the help of therapy. It didn’t just help them heal, but also revealed that deeper emotional traumas were often the cause of their gender dysphoria and the reason they chose transgenderism in the first place. All of the people claim that those who proposed or helped them transition often (unknowingly) created more pain.

Shupe suffered from PTSD after nearly 20 years of service in the military. The brief reads, “Mr. Shupe argues that his gender transitions were the result of his mental confusion and that he should have been treated with therapy rather than fictional identities. ‘I should have been treated. Instead, at every step, doctors, judges, and advocacy groups indulged my fiction.’”

The brief describes Heyer’s journey as both a former transgender person and one who now counsels so many who struggle. From both perspectives, Heyer believes current transgender medical protocols fail to treat the root causes.

Heyer now informally mentors people who also regret attempting to identify as a person of the opposite sex, such as by adopting a different name and opposite-sex pronouns, wearing clothing and hairstyles typically associated with the opposite sex, using sex-segregated spaces and engaging in sex-segregated activities that correspond to the opposite sex, and changing their appearance to more closely resemble the opposite sex through makeup, clothing, surgery, and hormones.

Heyer has seen firsthand the harm that can come from encouraging people down that path. Every person Heyer has mentored has concluded that he or she was not born transgender. They believe transgenderism is a learned behavior, a social ideology, not an innate condition from birth. Heyer says he has seen too much unhappiness and regret over the years from hormone therapy and surgeries to think otherwise.

Outcomes of Seeking Surgery Instead of Therapy

The brief describes a number of possible outcomes if gender-confused people seek plastic surgery and opposite-sex hormones rather than receive help through therapy:

Seeking to align one’s mind with reality has always been the preferred method for treating dysphorias, such as anorexia, xenomelia (the feeling that one or more limbs do not belong), or transdisability (believing one has a physical disability that does not actually exist). No one would ever address an anorexic person’s needs by providing a low-calorie diet, diet pills and stomach stapling. Moreover, one of the most comprehensive scientific studies tracking individuals who underwent sex-reassignment surgery revealed that (1) the rate of psychiatric hospitalization was approximately three times higher for postoperative individuals than a control group; (2) mortality rates and rates of criminal conviction also increased; (3) suicide attempts were almost five times more likely than before surgery; and (4) the likelihood of suicide following surgery was 19 times higher than the control group, adjusted for prior psychiatric illness.

The brief continues:

Hacsi Horvath is a Lecturer in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco (“UCSF”) and is an expert in clinical epidemiology. For 13 years, Mr. Horvath identified as a female and now that he has de-transitioned feels angry he was encouraged to embrace that lifestyle. ‘I am far angrier that thousands of young people are being irreversibly altered and sterilized as they are inducted into a drug-dependent and medically-maimed lifestyle.’

The amicus brief also says, “Affirming the dysphoria in people suffering from gender identity issues as if they really were persons of the opposite sex only serves to lead those that are suffering with such issues away from finding the serenity and wholeness of being at peace with their bodies and identities. Forcing employers to affirm the denial of reality is not required by Title VII and is more likely to cause harm than good.”

While this brief will only play a small role in this important case, its personal testimonies and arguments should influence public discourse.

Pete Buttigieg Is Wrong About Democrats Who Support Natural Marriage,"The other night on CNN, Pete Buttigieg, in an interview with Jake Tapper, responded to Tapper’s question about Democrats who might oppose LGBT rights based on religious views, and about how they are different from Vice President Mike Pence, who opposes them on the same grounds. He said, “This is not an easy conversation for a lot of people who have, frankly, been brought up in a certain way and are struggling to get onto the right side of history.”

Buttigieg’s answer is disappointing for a number of reasons, first and foremost because he failed to answer Tapper’s question. Buttigieg’s failure to articulate how socially conservative Democrats are different from Pence is a disservice to Democrats, especially black Protestant Christians — less than 50 percent of whom, as Tapper mentioned earlier in the interview, support same-sex marriage. These voters have a right to know if they are welcome in the Democratic Party given their views on LGBT rights, or if they will be taken for granted or merely tolerated.

Of course, the reason Buttigieg couldn’t answer the question is that there is no difference between Pence opposing LGBT rights on religious grounds and socially conservative Democrats doing the same. But if Buttigieg said that, he would undoubtedly offend socially conservative Democrats, including black Protestant Christians, and lessen his chances of winning the Democratic nomination.

Buttigieg’s “right side of history” language, however, is problematic for another reason. While he and LGBT leaders might think the arc of history bends a certain way, on this issue, it doesn’t.

Same-Sex Marriage Isn’t on the ‘Right Side of History’

In her book released earlier this year, “Confronting Christianity,” author Rebecca McLaughlin addressed “the right side of history” argument LGBT activists often employ, and noted it simply isn’t true. McLaughlin writes:

Opposition to homosexual sex is common to the two largest global worldviews — Christianity and Islam — as well as to most other religious traditions. Given the global population trends, the claim that those who oppose gay marriage will be ‘on the wrong side of history’ is likely inaccurate.

The population trends to which McLaughlin refers paint an eye-opening picture. In Europe and America — places more open to same-sex marriage — fertility rates are below replacement levels, whereas in places such as Africa and the Muslim world — where same-sex marriage is most strongly opposed — fertility rates are significantly higher.

The world over, opposition to same-sex marriage is very common and will be increasingly so. Buttigieg claiming his view represents “the right side of history” is an ethnocentric and arrogant position to take, and doesn’t account for current demographic realities.

Race and Sexuality Are Different Things

It is also part of a larger false narrative the LGBT movement has predicated its existence on. By invoking “right side of history” language, Buttigieg is subtly implying his movement is similar to the civil rights movement. McLaughlin addresses this point in her book as well and offers several reasons why comparing the two movements is folly.

“First, unlike racial heritage,” writes McLaughlin, “sexual activity involves choice.” She goes on to parse this point further, adding, “While we do not choose our sexual attractions, we do choose our sexual actions. They therefore carry moral weight in a way that racial heritage does not.”

The second reason McLaughlin argues we need to resist the temptation to equate civil rights with LGBT rights is that, while there are no significant biological differences between races, there are real differences between men and women, “differences that are highly relevant in the context of sex.”

Furthermore, McLaughlin appeals to scripture to affirm that these two movements are of a different substance. “While the Bible cuts strongly and emphatically in favor of racial equality and integration,” explains McLaughlin, “it cuts equally emphatically against same-sex marriage.” Indeed, McLaughlin — herself a same-sex-attracted woman, happily married to a man — concludes that “the Bible is unequivocal on the question of homosexual sex.” The Bible opposes it.

To McLaughlin’s sound argument, I would add another reason the civil rights movement and LGBT movement should not be conflated: It’s demeaning to what African Americans have endured throughout U.S. history. Based both on scale and the level of hostility to which African Americans have been subjected, the two movements are certainly not equivalents.

‘Morally Repugnant’ Versus ‘Culturally Disfavored’

By using “right side of history” language, Buttigieg has affirmed just how urgent it is to disentangle sexuality and race. The combining of these two very different topics has most likely been a contributing factor to the downward trajectory of our political discourse. When the two are joined together, everyone who opposes same-sex marriage is portrayed in the same light as those who oppose racial equality.

In regards to this commingling of sexuality and race, and the harm it has done to American democracy, Andrew Walker of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission has offered some helpful guidance. In an article at the Pubic Discourse, Walker calls those on the left to distinguish what is “morally repugnant from what is culturally disfavored.”

Currently, the view that marriage is meant to be between one man and one woman is the culturally disfavored position. But when people conceive of it as a “morally repugnant” position and urge others to join them on “the right side of history,” it turns everyone who resists that call into a bigot.

It cannot possibly be the case that more than half of black Protestant Christians are bigots, nor most of the people who hold to traditional marriage for religious reasons. As McLaughlin concurred in “Confronting Christianity,” “We must stop assuming that all traditional Christians are hateful bigots simply because they restrict marriage to male and female.”

Buttigieg should answer the question Tapper asked him the other night and declare once and for all whether he believes those who oppose same-sex marriage and the LGBT movement have a place in the Democratic Party. He should also refrain from “right side of history” language and admit that while Christians hold to a view of marriage that is “culturally disfavored,” it isn’t “morally repugnant.” Nor will it likely be on the wrong side of history.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/09/05/pete-buttigieg-wrong-democrats-support-natural-marriage/,2019-09-05
LGBT Activists: Drew Brees Promoting The Bible Is Homophobic,"Is being an openly Christian person so deeply stigmatized as to be viewed as deathblow to your career and social standing in America today? From the media response to NFL star Drew Brees’ message to his young fans on being proud of and sharing their faith, this may not be a far-fetched question.

Brees released a short video encouraging young people to share their faith by bringing their Bibles to school on October 3, 2019. The event is an annual celebration designed to encourage personal freedom, religious freedom, and religious pride, and is sponsored by Focus on the Family, a conservative Christian advocacy organization.

The reaction was instantaneous and intensely hostile. Sports commentator Robert Littal tweeted, “Drew Brees Created a PSA Video for an Anti-Gay Religious Cult That Believes in Conversion Therapy & Fights Against Any Anti-Discrimination Laws; Wants Kids to Bring Bible to School to Convert Other Kids.” Out Magazine, an LGBT publication, shamed Brees for associating with Focus on the Family, which they refer to as an “anti-gay extremist group.”

In 2010 Brees made a video for the It Gets Better series, which encourages LGBT youth to push through school bullying. In this video, he says, “If you’re making fun of someone because they are different, then you are no friend of mine.” He also partnered with Ellen DeGeneres to promote an anti-bullying campaign. Thus his work with Focus on the Family’s campaign, Out asserts, demonstrates a fall from grace.

Queerty, another LGBT media site, took it a step a step further with the headline, “NFL star Drew Brees partners with Focus on the Family to promote hate.” The article quotes this line from the video as evidence: “I want to encourage you to live out your faith on Bring Your Bible To School Day and share God’s love with friends.” They conclude, “Even though Brees doesn’t specifically mention LGBTQ people in the video, affiliating himself for nearly a decade with an organization that has such a long and sordid history of homophobia puts him squarely in the same corner.”

To be sure, Focus on the Family is very clear on their support for traditional marriage and concepts of gender and sexuality. They follow a Christian, biblical worldview. Despite the relentless insistence from the modern left, this does not make them bad or “hateful” people.

In what has become an astonishingly controversial position in the last decade or so, preferring to maintain a specific lifestyle surrounding a specific religious worldview is not dangerous or threatening to anyone. The organization simply advocates for their religious beliefs, openly and proudly, and has chosen not to compromise their principles in favor of cultural changes. That’s all.

Regardless of the laundry list of liberal, cultural, offenses those in media cite as validation of Focus’s status as a “hate” group, they do very good work in their community and the world at large. “Anti-gay” has come to be an all-inclusive term for any group or individual who disagrees with the modern LGBT advocacy movement. Instead, Focus on the Family promotes a culture and a tradition in which their members choose to engage and perpetuate. The fact that the left is deeply intolerant of this cultural tradition is not reason enough to dehumanize them or deny them their rights or freedoms.

Brees, a man of conviction and religious faith, should not be held to the moral and social standards of people who choose to express their views through actual, tangible hatred and literal intolerance. Conservative Christians do not deserve public shaming, shunning and baseless accusations simply for promoting their faith to their own community.

Christians in professional and public roles should not have to fear stigma, hatred, discrimination, or slander for living their faith on their own terms. More to the point, demanding the religiously observant violate their core beliefs in order to avoid public harassment and humiliation goes against everything we stand for as a country.

Tolerance is not the public agreement to believe the same things. LGBT Americans are in no way threatened or harmed by the existence of people who view the world differently than they do, exactly what Brees promoted in his It Gets Better video.

The Bring Your Bible to School Day is a campaign, like National Coming Out Day, designed to create a positive environment of personal empowerment and sharing who you are with your peers. Why should Christian students be stigmatized for being themselves at school? The left must learn to be tolerant of those who are different from them.

Despite our difference in religious and social views, I stand with Focus on the Family, the students nationwide who will stand up for their faith on October 3, and Drew Brees staying true to himself and his community. Rather than violating his promise to combat bullying, I see him as honoring his commitment to being a great role model through this campaign.

Is it so difficult to imagine that a man of faith could support kindness and compassion towards LGBT students and encourage Christian students to be proud of their faith and share it with others? Why can’t inclusion and diversity include everyone in their own way? Why does the left insist on targeting only Christians for harassment, hatred, and public shaming?

More People Watched Fox Or MSNBC During CNN's Climate Town Hall,"On September 4, CNN hosted a seven-hour long climate change town hall that had the lowest viewership among cable news networks.

According to The Hill, CNN averaged 1.1 million viewers during the climate change town hall. The programming began at 5 p.m. and ended at midnight. Fox News came in first that night among cable news networks at 3.5 million viewers, while MSNBC came in second with 1.7 million viewers.

CNN decided to host a climate change town hall after the Democratic National Committee voted against hosting an entire debate devoted to the issue. CNN used their entire prime time lineup: Wolf Blitzer, Erin Burnett, Chris Cuomo, Don Lemon, and their chief climate correspondent, Bill Weir.

The event was an absolute flop. The questions were dull, the moderators and audience members were hesitant to push against the candidates’ proposals, and the proposed solution to everything was “ban it.”

Following the lead of the woke warriors at CNN, MSNBC now plans to host a climate change forum — mostly with candidates who did not qualify for CNN’s town hall.

CNN evidently takes no caution fromvits poor ratings, because on October 10 they will host a similarly structured town hall on LGBTQ issues.

“On the eve of National Coming Out Day, Human Rights Campaign Foundation will host a historic Power of Our Pride Democratic presidential town hall, exclusively broadcast on CNN and CNN en Español, focused on issues important to the LGBTQ community,” Human Rights Campaign tweeted.

BREAKING: On the eve of #NationalComingOutDay, @HRC Foundation will host a historic #PowerOfOurPride Democratic presidential town hall, exclusively broadcast on @CNN and @CNNEE, focused on issues important to the LGBTQ community. https://t.co/OsDUzIDk98 pic.twitter.com/KdDGOHfpuH — Human Rights Campaign (@HRC) September 5, 2019

According to Human Rights Campaign, thus far only six candidates have confirmed their participation in the event: Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Julián Castro, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, and Elizabeth Warren.

To participate in the LGBTQ town hall, the candidates must fulfill the qualifications set by the DNC for the October debate stage. Candidates have until September 26 to qualify for the next CNN town hall.

Being Scared At Finding A Man In The Ladies’ Bathroom Isn’t Bigotry,"On August 29, people arrived at the Lincoln County Courthouse in Newport, Oregon to show support for a transgender person named Lauren Jackson, who had recently recovered from an assault after using the women’s bathroom while looking like a man.

Speaking at the event, Pastor Bob Barrett of Yachats Community Presbyterian Church stated, “People of faith to just come together and say whatever your theology is, whatever your beliefs on this issue, can we come together and say that hate is wrong, that violence is wrong? The type of violence that we saw last week is wrong,”

The Lincoln County Commissioner lamented of the assault on Jackson, “Well, frankly, it felt like a kick in the gut. I’m sad. I’m angry. I’m embarrassed for my community. The fact that the person was not a local really doesn’t make a lot of difference. It certainly doesn’t lessen Lauren’s suffering.”

The alleged assailant, Fred Joseph Costanza, is an unemployed, multi-state criminal offender. He was drunk at the time of the assault and allegedly so violently attacked Jackson, hitting Jackson more than 10 times in the face, he broke Jackson’s jaw and Jackson had to be hospitalized. Jackson may require facial reconstruction surgery as a result.

Costanza was arrested and is being held under a $140,000 bail. He is charged with first-degree intimidation, second-degree assault, and two misdemeanors. The charge of “intimidation” is now considered a “bias” crime in Oregon. Jackson is homeless and recently moved to Portland, Oregon.

Jackson described the incident saying, “He just comes up and starts yelling something about me being a lady, thinking I’m a lady. I just stand there and I don’t say anything. I don’t raise my hands. And he just blindsides me from the beginning and the rest was him dragging me around and continuing to punch me, and I’m just screaming. Someone heard and ran across the park and tackled this guy off of me.”

Jackson also reported to the press, “All of a sudden being pretty is very important to me. I’m having a rough start,” in describing the facial injuries.

LGBT Nation, one of the largest LGBT news resources, titled an article describing the assault as, “Man breaks trans woman’s jaw for using restroom at Oregon state park.” The article went on to say, “Bathroom bills aren’t just transphobic, they actually encourage people to attack trans people just for existing.”

As always, there is another perspective to the story. LGBT Nation reported that the incident began when Costanza’s wife left the restroom and told her husband a man was in the restroom with her, harassing her. Her husband immediately confronted Jackson.

Jackson lamented the difficult situation, arguing, “Do you have to take away somebody else’s rights in order to protect someone’s rights? Is one more important than the other? I don’t know. I don’t feel safe using the men’s restroom. And other people don’t feel safe having me in the women’s restroom.”

Looking at the situation objectively, however, it appears that Jackson’s physical appearance is highly relevant. Jackson looks male in all aspects and largely presents as male in the photos provided to the press. Aside from androgynous clothing, Jackson has facial hair, long curly hair styled in a gender-neutral way, and does not wear makeup. The woman involved in the incident simply would have had no way of knowing this individual identified as transgender and would have only understood that a man was in a public restroom with her and, according to her, harassing her.

Costanza was drunk and appears to have been a violent person, according to his criminal history. Certainly beating a person is never justified and he has been rightfully charged with assault. The question is, should he be also charged with a hate crime, and is this an argument for more legal protections for transgender individuals?

While the current LGBT argument is that transgender people do not need to look any certain way to validate their gender identity, it is unreasonable to expect the overwhelming majority of people to understand this and easily recognize transgender as a legally sheltered identity. Regardless of what the left insists, it is not safe for men to freely be in women’s restrooms.

Whatever occurred between Jackson and Costanza’s wife has not been confirmed, and it is unclear if Jackson represented any specific threat. But the woman involved had no way of knowing this. Her experience is important too, and she is not hateful or a bigot for responding with concern when entering a state park restroom and discovering someone who looked like a man alone with her.

While Jackson should not be forced to use restrooms Jackson feels unsafe in either, it is unreasonable for Jackson to expect others to ignore Jackson’s physical appearance and assume Jackson is not a threat because Jackson identifies as a woman.

Transgender hate crimes are difficult to broadly describe because the situations in which they can occur are not always straightforward. Based on what we know right now, Jackson was not necessarily assaulted by a “bigot” just for using the restroom, although Jackson was assaulted for identifying as a woman. It’s not clear whether Costanza or his wife knew Jackson is transgender and that motivated the alleged attack.

How could this situation have been avoided legally? If the law stated Jackson had a right to use the women’s restroom, would Costanza’s wife have be able to distinguish between a potential predator and a transgender woman in that moment? How was Costanza supposed to respond to his fearful wife reporting that a man was harassing her in the women’s restroom? The LGB T advocacy position is simply unsustainable in real life.

We have reached a point in which gender identity is astonishingly fluid and can be as commonly experienced in daily life as same-sex couples are. We cannot pretend this is a fringe issue we can ignore. Clearly authorities have chosen to adopt the more extreme LGBT narrative in response to any incident involving an LGBT person, leaving average people without a voice or an advocate for more reasonable discussion.

While transgender individuals have the right to use public restrooms in peace just as everyone else does, we lack a social expectation of reasonable accommodation in how they associate their outward appearance with their gender identity. The resulting misunderstandings and confrontations cannot be ignored or avoided, and confused individuals cannot always be assumed to be hateful bigots deserving of severe social shaming and criminal punishment.

It’s time we have a real discussion about this real-life issue, and all voices involved deserve an equal say and consideration.

Drew Brees Shouldn't Have Ditched Christian Brothers Over A Twitter Mob,"Once upon a time, there were 10 brothers who were charged with guarding a gem the king had given to their village — a beautiful stone that promised them the king’s favor and protection.

When charging the brothers to secure this precious gem, the king gave them clear instructions: “My enemy will constantly be scheming to take this gem away from you. He will threaten you with violence. He will mock you and turn your friends against you. He will try to convince you the gem is not really yours or you don’t really need it. But no matter what approach he uses, don’t fall for his tricks.”

One day, the king’s enemy approached the 10 brothers with a small army behind him.

“I imagine you’ve come here to steal our gem,” the oldest brother said.

“Absolutely not,” the enemy insisted. “I think it’s wonderful that you have it. I just hate to see the way your brother is using the gem. His tone is always abrasive and arrogant when he talks about protecting it. It gives the rest of you a bad name. Dismiss him from his post guarding the gem, and my army will leave you alone.”

The oldest brother always found his youngest sibling a bit irritating and embarrassing, so he considered this a no-brainer and immediately gave the enemy what he asked. A week later, the enemy returned with his army, now claiming he had problems with the second-youngest brother. “This guy has been saying the gem doesn’t belong to certain people in the village, people he doesn’t like. This is unloving and cruel. Disavow him too, and we’ll be friends.”

The oldest brother wasn’t especially fond of that brother either, so he once again gave the enemy what he wanted. But week after week, the enemy kept returning and asking for the oldest brother to separate himself from another one of his brothers until, eventually, the oldest brother stood alone — the sole remaining guardian of the gem. Seeing that the man now had no one left to defend him, the enemy walked up to the oldest brother, whispered, “You fell for it,” into his ear, stabbed him through the heart, and walked away with the gemstone.

Hear the parable of the guardians explained. The king is Christ. The gemstone is his salvation. The brothers are Christians. The enemy is the devil, and his army is the mob of anti-Christian voices in the world. And the moral of the story is this: No matter what they say, the devil and this world won’t be content until they’ve taken Christ’s salvation away from you. So don’t throw your fellow believers under the bus to escape persecution. All you’ll do is hasten your demise.

The Demise of Drew Brees

Recently, New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees, a self-identified Christian who frequently speaks about his faith, filmed a promotion for “Bring your Bible to School Day,” an event organized by Focus on the Family. He encouraged students to bring a copy of the scriptures to school on Oct. 3 and to use it as a means of confessing the gospel to their friends.

Shortly thereafter, the ever-predictable gaggle of anti-Christian rage geese began lashing out at Brees for associating himself with the supposedly “anti-gay,” “anti-LGBT religious organization.”

Drew Brees Created a PSA Video for an Anti-Gay Religious Cult That Believes in Conversion Therapy & Fights Against Any Anti-Discrimination Laws; Wants Kids to Bring Bible to School to Convert Other Kids (Vid) https://t.co/gywLbmzOfL pic.twitter.com/xDoxP4q3cr — Robert Littal BSO (@BSO) September 4, 2019

Brees quickly released a video seeking to clarify his position on the issue. The Super Bowl champion accepted, at face value, the charge that Focus on the Family was an anti-LGBT group. He then insisted he was previously unaware of these views, did not share them, and considers those views antithetical to Christianity. Then the Twitter mob told him his apology wasn’t good enough and continued attacking him.

In other words, the enemy approached Brees, guardian of the gemstone, and told him, “Get rid of your Bible-believing bigoted brother, and we’ll leave you alone.” Brees obliged, and the enemy stabbed him through the heart anyway.

Chris Pratt and Nathan Pyle Fell For the Trick, Too

Brees is not the first Christian celebrity to be fooled by this method of attack. Last February, actor Chris Pratt subtly distanced himself from his congregation’s teachings on homosexuality after actress and professional scold Ellen Page criticized him for attending a supposedly anti-LGBTQ church.

“My faith is important to me but no church defines me or my life, and I am not a spokesman for any church or group of people,” Pratt wrote. “My values define who I am. We need less hate in this world, not more. I am a man who believes that everyone is entitled to love who they want free from the judgment of their fellow man.”

In other words, “My church may officially oppose gay commitment ceremonies, but I do not.” The mob, however, wasn’t placated. Pratt couldn’t just disagree with his “homosexuality is a sin” brother. He had to kick him out of the room.

Likewise, in April, after cartoonist Nathan Pile found himself facing a storm of criticism for a years-old, mildly pro-life tweet, he quickly informed those growling in his direction that he wasn’t so pro-life as to actually vote for those dastardly Republicans. “Our votes go toward the Democratic Party,” he said.

Again, the mob was not satisfied. It wasn’t enough for Pyle to keep his opposition to abortion private. He wasn’t allowed to oppose it at all:

Yeah if your conception of Christian faith includes ""not supporting reproductive rights"" I'm out. To think that someone whose better known creation is a comic called ""Strange Planet"" wouldn't understand the necessity of questioning his own beliefs is… more than disappointing. — Reaction Pic de la Mirandole (@Syrrigald) April 9, 2019

It’s understandable that Brees, Pratt, and Pyle were fooled by the devil’s trick. When cancel culture comes for you, threatening to hound you at work (Brees) or to stop you from working altogether (Pratt and Pyle), it’s understandable why you might panic and look for the quickest method possible to get the mob to call off its attack. Indeed, many Christians are, in fact, brutish in tone, foolish, and ignorant, so in the heat of the moment, it can seem like a no-brainer to disavow someone you don’t think you need to satisfy for someone who won’t leave you alone.

Never Sacrifice Your Brothers

But what all these men proved with their acquiescence is that you don’t gain friends by sacrificing brothers. You won’t escape trouble by becoming the kind of Christian who rejects the church’s historical teaching on homosexuality. Rather, you’ll just become more vulnerable to an enemy that won’t leave you alone until you become the kind of Christian who rejects Christ himself.

Likewise, what these men also need to understand is that, as a Christian, not a single one of your brothers is expendable. You are called to defend and serve all of them. You need all of them, and you especially need those who are most reviled in the eyes of the world, as those are often the ones who are showing you what it looks like to say “no” when the culture demands you bow before its idols.

As a Lutheran, I have less in common with Focus on the Family than Brees does, theologically speaking. I disagree with them deeply and profoundly on many issues, such as the conversion of man and the nature of the sacraments. I pray God will one day make our sad divisions cease. But in the meantime, I am happy to have them as a faithful ally on issues of human sexuality.

So to speak in their defense, it’s worth noting that Focus on the Family is not an “anti-gay” organization, despite the histrionics of secular torch-wielders. It does not preach hatred or rejection of people who identify as LGBT, nor does it support cruel or unusual methods of dehomosexualizing people. It does not encourage people to withhold food or friendship from their gay neighbors. Rather, Focus on the Family encourages people to treat them the same way they treat everyone else — by saying, “Christ died for your sins, so you can let go of them now, whatever those sins may be.”

Granted, because unbelievers don’t want to let go of their sins or admit their need for Christ to give them the salvation the Bible says they failed to earn, the anti-Christian mob will not be able to see the distinction between telling gay people, “You are subhuman,” and, “I want you to have peace with God, and you won’t find that in homosexual acts.” Such is the nature of unbelief. As St. Paul told us, “Natural man is not capable of understanding the things of God.”

Drew Brees Should Have Known Better

But as a self-identified Christian, Brees ought to understand the difference between hating people and calling them to repentance, just as he ought to remember Christ’s promise that those who belong to him should expect the world to persecute them. So when persecution came knocking a few days ago, Brees should have recognized what was happening.

Instead of chastising the media for unfairly aligning him with the views of Focus on the Family, he should have chastised the media for unfairly distorting those views, and then he should have properly presented them. Then, for good measure, he should have asked journalists why they weren’t criticizing self-identified Catholics such as Nancy Pelosi or Stephen Colbert for aligning themselves with a religious organization that shares Focus on the Family’s views on gay marriage. He should have defended his brothers instead of dismissing them.

I hope the social media mob simply caught Brees off guard and that he didn’t fully consider his response in light of Christ’s call to stand firm in the face of persecution. Likewise, I hope the next time the enemy approaches, he doesn’t abandon another group of Christians to gain the favor of a sinful world that will never give an ounce of its love to those who have received the sinlessness of Christ.

The next time the enemy asks Drew Brees to sacrifice one of his gemstone-guarding brothers, I hope the former MVP doesn’t fall for the trick. Otherwise, it won’t be long before he has no brothers left to defend him and no gemstone left to guard.

"It Doesn't Matter Whether Or Not A 'Gay Gene' Exists, And Here's Why","Searching the phrase “the gay gene” in Nexus brings up thousands of articles beginning in 1979 all the way to the present day. The topic has been a mainstay of LGBT advocacy for decades now since, as sociologist Thomas Alloway correctly predicted, a confirmed genetic cause of homosexuality would support arguments for legal protection.

In 1979, writing for the Canadian paper The Globe and Mail, Lydia Dotto argued in favor of seeking out a genetic component to homosexuality, quoting Alloway:

He said that many of the problems gays face stem from the beliefs of heterosexuals concerning the causes of homosexuality. Straights often believe that homosexuality stems from something abnormal in the gay’s post-birth environment and that homosexuals are themselves a part of that abnormal environment (hence the fears about recruiting.) Many do not want gays near children or in positions of respect and responsibility and many want to change or ‘cure’ gays. Such fears would be unfounded if it were proved that homosexuality was caused primarily by genes.

Writing for The Weekly Standard in 1996, Chandler Burr titled an article “Why Conservatives Should Embrace The Gay Gene,” arguing, “The question about homosexuality and volition — whether one chooses to be gay — is subject to empirical verification. And among researchers, this question is considered answered. Which means that supporting Position 1 or 2 — lifestyle or disease — will soon be as politically successful for the Republican party as supporting creationism.”

Two years later, Jeffrey L. Sheler, writing for U.S. News and World Report, argued in an article titled “Faith-based therapies aim to ‘cure’ gays”: “Biology is destiny. The weight of scientific research in recent years suggests homosexuality has biological roots, with highly publicized studies suggesting that a ‘gay gene’ or differences in brain structure may determine sexual orientation.”

In 1995, writing for U.S. News and World Report, Betsy Streisand, in an article titled “Getting a little science on his side,” quoted a study participant named Daniel Phelan. Phelan states, “Sometimes I have just wanted to shake people and say, ‘Do you think I just woke up one day and decided I wanted to be society’s definition of a deviant?’ … It shattered my own expectations to realize that I was gay and that I would never have a wife or children or a traditional family. But I always knew it wasn’t something I did or something I ate. I always knew it was something I was.”

For much of LGBT social history, from the 1980s to the recent explosion of gender identity, gay men and women have long waited for scientific confirmation of their sexuality. It has been a key argument to our very legal existence.

Latest Media Storm About ‘Gay Gene’ Studies

So in the last week of August 2019, as news outlets began releasing headlines, as CNN did, saying “No ‘gay gene’ can predict sexual orientation, study says,” LGBT media was uncertain exactly how to respond. Out magazine chose to interpret the study, published in Science Magazine, with the headline “There’s no ‘Gay Gene’ — There are Thousands.”

Describing the five markers discovered to influence sexuality, author Matt Baume wrote, “None of them had a significant impact, but in total, those markers are thought to contribute a small amount to an individual’s sexual orientation. What’s more, the research team says, behavior is further impacted by personal environment and experiences. Essentially, they claim sexuality is both nature and nurture.”

LGBT Nation took the position similar to previous eras of discussion on the topic by reacting to how the religious right would view the study. In an article titled “The religious right is really happy about the study saying there is no single ‘gay gene,’” writer John Gallagher states, “Anti-LGBTQ conservatives are using the study to argue being gay is a choice that can be cured by ex-gay ‘therapy.’”

The article cites Jim Dennison, head of the Christian Dennison Institute, arguing, “Even if up to 32 percent of a person’s same-sex sexual behavior is genetically conditioned, this means that more than two-thirds of their sexual behavior is not.” The article also quotes columnist Rod Dreher, writing for The American Conservative, “If homosexuality is primarily a matter of nurture, not nature, why is it wrong to let gay people who want to seek therapy in hope of reducing or eliminating same-sex desire undergo that treatment?”

In the same news cycle, a video of two apparently male lions engaging in mating behavior went viral, leading to the LGBT Nation headline, “This video of male lions mating has gone viral, reminding us that being gay is natural.” It argues that more than 1,500 species of animals have been seen engaging in homosexual behaviors. Of course, the article mentions one lion could have been female, as many female lions have manes, or if both were male, it could have been a demonstration of play or other nonsexual behavior.

But the alignment of headlines seems to illustrate an important aspect of this now-decades-long argument: Animals that engage in mating behaviors with others of their own sex are demonstrating instinctive behavior, and instinctive behavior is a very shaky foundation to stand on.

So What If People Are Gay Because They Want to Be?

The “gay gene” argument was born out of a need for social validation and has ever since been an anticipated victory over conservative objection toward liberal sexual ideology. But the religious conservative writers quoted above are correct that if sexuality is largely conditioned behavior, it can rationally be altered through intervention. Sexual and gender identity theory sways back and forth between the idea of a permanent, inborn condition and personal revelation and design in identity. Seeking out science to prove their theories only limits their options when that same science fails them.

As a gay person, I never relied on the idea of genetic destiny regarding my sexuality because it largely took away my sense of personal control over my life and decisions. As I grew older, the “cause” of my sexuality became less and less relevant.

I am happy in my life and husband. I live in a free society where I can enjoy choosing the lifestyle I want. I am not limited or defined solely by my emotions and instincts. I really do not care why I am gay, as I am perfectly content being so. What the LGBT community fails to understand when citing animal behavior studies or genetic investigations is that both only describe how an animal or an individual behaves. It does not shed light onto how they think, feel, or perceive.

I predict this study, as so many others, will be used to validate whatever social narrative the reader prefers, as it is capable of addressing both nature and nurture arguments. But in the end, it really does not matter if several genes interact in such a way as to push an instinctual desire toward same-sex sexual behavior or if it is found not to be influential at all. What matters is the freedom to choose how you wish to act on your desires in a society that tolerates a great many optional lifestyles. In this, I believe both arguments are valid.

A person should not have to explain or be held to a strict scientific set of reasoning for why he or she is in a same-sex relationship, and a person should not be shamed away from or legally forbidden to seek out options to alter how they respond to those same urges. What the end result comes down to is personal liberty. It is my hope that the LGBT left is able to understand why that is far more valuable for their social movement than any scientific study could ever be.

LGBT Activists Drag Ben Carson About Trans Men In Women's Shelters,"The latest dust-up involving transgenderism has ensnared Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson in its tentacles, which now seem to reach into every aspect of American life. In comments last week, Carson had the audacity to suggest that some women in shelters, many of whom have faced abuse from men, are not comfortable with “big, hairy men” being in the facilities.

In a department-wide email on Friday Carson sought to tamp down the controversy, pointing out that it was women’s groups who were raising these concerns with him: “During a recent meeting with local staff in San Francisco, I made reference to the fact that I had heard from many women’s groups about the difficulty they were having with women’s shelters because sometimes men would claim to be women, and that HUD’s policy required the shelter to accept—without question—the word of whoever came in, regardless of what their manifested physical characteristics appeared to be.”

A vital two words in those remarks are “without question,” by which Carson means that the only operable standard at the moment is what an applicant to a shelter claims as his or her sex. This is a nonsensical standard, bereft of any scientific evidence, and which places the feelings of men who believe they are women over the rights of vulnerable women to feel safe in their shelters.

But this was not good enough for trans activists, who refuse to believe that any opposition or even questioning of their assault on thousands of years of consensus on the differences between men and women is anything but pure bigotry. The president of the Human Rights Campaign, Alphonso David, had this to say: “Ben Carson has spent his career in politics expressing disgust toward the existence of transgender people. From his comments on trans people in the military to his support for a proposal that would literally permit emergency shelters to turn away trans people who are homeless to his unqualified support for a White House that has made attacking trans people a mantra, it is hardly surprising that Ben Carson would blatantly dehumanize trans people in his official capacity.”

The sleight of hand here is remarkable and worth noting. Carson is accused of expressing disgust at the existence of trans people, something he has never done. What is the evidence that he feels this disgust? It’s solely the fact that he wants public policy to have an actual standard beyond “I woke up feeling like a woman today” in determining public policy in areas where men and women are treated differently.

This hyperbolic bollocks from leftists arguing that anyone who does not tow their line to the T is some horrible bigot is, more than anything else, what stands in the way of effective public policy related to transgenderism. It is a “my way or the highway” approach that does not allow for nuance or even discussion on a matter that is nowhere near a consensus in the United States.

While there is no evidence that Carson feels “disgust” about trans people — in fact, he has specifically said that they deserve the same love as anyone else — there is evidence to suggest that the medical doctor who became a famous surgeon does not believe men can become women. On Tucker Carlson’s TV show, he used an analogy in which he said if woke up one day and felt like he was Chinese, that would not make him Chinese, which is obviously also true.

Millions of Americans do not accept the metaphysical assertion that people can switch their sex. There are millions who do believe it, or at least say they do. This is exactly the kind of situation where those in charge of public policy, like cabinet secretaries, have to balance these disparate beliefs rather than give primacy to one set out of deference to the current mores of identity politics.

Do those who are attacking Carson really believe that the correct response for him to give women’s groups who raise these concerns is to tell them they are being intolerant and should just accept this new reality, and then refuse to take action or even bring up their worries at his department? What an absolutely outrageous suggestion.

Carson is not just the HUD secretary for trans people and the political left; he is the HUD secretary of all Americans, including those with reasonable concerns about women’s safety in shelters, prisons, and other women-only facilities. What is telling is that this current outrage is not about a policy put in place. It’s not even about a specific policy proposal. It is about having that conversation at all.

Amid farcical calls from Democrats for his resignation, Carson is handling the controversy the right way. With a calm demeanor, a respect for the dignity of all people, and doubtless support from his boss in the Oval Office, he is insisting that this important conversation take place and not be sidelined by leftist bullies whose arguments can’t match their outrage. Put more bluntly, he is doing his job, doing it well, and should stay exactly the course he has set himself on.

Why LGBTQ Kids Shouldn't Be Exceptions To Limits On Screen Time,"How much screen time is too much is frequently up for debate. Parents, media, and educators all chime in on whether screen time is bad or neutral, but it’s rare to see an opinion claiming screen time for tweens and teens is a net good.

Enter Amber Leventry to argue in the Washington Post that for LGBTQ kids, screen time is a necessity. Leventry, a 39-year-old transgender person, believes social media is a place for LGBTQ kids to find community. Yet LGBTQ youth shouldn’t be singled out with a pass to partake in harmful activities just because of their identifiers.

We all spend too much time on our phones. They are extensions of our hands. We all worry we’re not adequately experiencing reality. Writing this, I am sitting outside my kid’s piano lesson trying to avoid talking tothe other parents by appearing incredibly absorbed by my screen. Retreats and spa getaways insist people stay off their phones, and every day, social media is filled with posts admonishing fellow users for staying too long enraptured by virtuality.

Every few months, the debate surfaces again in major media outlets about the effects of screen time on children and teens. ABC reported that “as digital media use has increased among teens who are part of Generation Z, aptly dubbed iGen, so have their feelings of loneliness and depression.” The Washington Post detailed a study showing that “adolescents’ psychological well-being decreased the more hours a week they spent on screens, including with the Internet, social media, texting, gaming and video chats. The findings jibe with earlier studies linking frequent screen use to teenage depression and anxiety.”

So why should this behavior be encouraged for kids who venture beyond heteronormativity? Presumably, these early reports didn’t study the effects of screen time and social media separately for LGBTQ youth versus heteronormative youth. The findings were for kids across the board. Sending LGBTQ kids down the rabbit hole of social media with the idea that it’s the only place they can find community sets them up for failure.

The world of social media is not reality. Instead, it is a collection of constructed fictions designed to elicit likes from viewers.

Screens Hurt LGBTQ Kids the Same as Everyone Else

Leventry posits that because lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and nonbinary youth have so few peers who share their identity, they have to take to online realms for connection. She writes:

Vanessa Lee Nic, an advocate and the mother to a 10-year-old transgender son named Dylan, allows her son a private and heavily monitored Instagram account. ‘Being 10 and being trans can feel lonely,’ she says. ‘He doesn’t have one trans friend his age in our small town. So, this allows him that community. It’s pretty invaluable, honestly.’

While so many parents struggle with how much screen time is the right amount, the idea is that parents of non-gender-conforming kids should give their children access to social media to reinforce their identities. Those peers Leventry cited include famous and influential LGBTQ people.

“Popular Instagram figures such as Jazz Jennings, Aydian Dowling, and Rebekah Bruesehoff are showing the world — and other transgender youth and young adults — the power and joy of living authentic lives. Kids like Dylan, and parents like his mom, appreciate the willingness of others to be the positive representation LGBTQ folks so sorely need,” she writes.

Youth in general are being steered away from putting too much stock in social media, as it gives them a false sense of what really matters. But she recommends LGBTQ youth be allowed broader access to what’s being shown on the platforms, simply by virtue of their sexual or gender identities. Don’t these kids need just as much protection from overpaid narcissistic influencers as every heterosexual kid? Why should LGBTQ social media personalities be considered a good influence when they are part of the exact same image-affirmation economy as their heteronormative peers?

Aspirational Instagram Images Don’t Offer Community

Girls have been specifically warned away from Instagram and social media because the images they see from top posters become aspirational for them. Those beautiful, model-perfect images that were once the purview of fashion magazines and high celebrity now come on social media platforms from those who are seeking fame as well and have attained it. Girls want what the influencers are peddling.

Writing in Forbes, Nicole Fisher points out some of the dangers of girls seeking too much affirmation on Instagram:

Compared to Twitter, Facebook or YouTube, it appears that Instagram leads to more comparisons between ourselves and others. This, in turn, contributes to more anxiety and depression due to feelings of inadequacy. Research suggests this is due to increased exposure to ‘idealized’ images of other women, couples, and lives in general. Increased exposure is linked to decreased happiness with one’s own life.

If it’s not ideal for girls to spend so much time online soaking up aspirational images for how to “better” themselves, why is it the right thing for any youth at all?

Tumblr and Instagram are both full of accounts that groom young people to appear a certain way. Simply because LGBTQ accounts that direct people how to look and morph their appearance are speaking to non-gender-conforming youth doesn’t make them better representations of reality nor adequate places for teens to find camaraderie and friendship. Accounts that instruct children on how to lose weight, not for health reasons but to achieve a look, are not safe places for kids.

Funneling kids into an online lifestyle negates the very real possibility that like-minded kids exist within their real-life communities. It also separates them from people who can be their friends regardless of the kids’ sexuality. The thing to do is not squirrel up with a screen in their bedroom, but rather to join groups where there are other kids.

Turning off the outside world and turning to virtuality for understanding creates more problems than it solves. Online personalities are curated and perfected for the utmost impact. Aspiring to be like those users is as damaging for LGBTQ kids as it is for girls who try to look like supermodels and engage in damaging behavior to attain the look.

Social media is not a safe space for kids to go in search of friends or an image, and it’s certainly not more viable for LGBTQ kids, who in their isolation are more vulnerable to predation and influence, not less.

Human Rights Campaign Endorses Trump Impeachment,"The Human Rights Campaign, a supposed LGBT advocacy group based in Washington, D.C., officially endorsed President Donald Trump’s impeachment Friday, which would, in effect, make Mike Pence president.

The organization’s official press release last week announced the group’s support for House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry into Trump, stemming from the controversy surrounding the president’s July phone call with the president of Ukraine, a call that had nothing to do with gay rights.

“The safety and well-being of our democracy is at stake,” HRC President Alphonso David said in a statement. “The U.S. House is right to launch a formal inquiry and investigate all others who may have played a role in these alleged crimes or were aware of them.”

These allegations are serious. @HRC supports a formal impeachment inquiry of Donald Trump. As @SpeakerPelosi said, no one is above the law, and that includes the President of the United States. https://t.co/ZdOQsd6oEC — Alphonso David (@AlphonsoDavid) September 27, 2019

The impeachment inquiry launched by House Democrats was sparked by a complaint from an anonymous whistleblower charging Trump with conspiring with the Ukrainian president to meddle in the next presidential election, charges invalidated by a declassified and unredacted transcript of the conversation between the two world leaders.

The latest move by the organization that claims to be the bulwark of gay rights comes at no surprise to those familiar with the group’s consistent unwavering support for the Democratic Party. The self-proclaimed gay rights group keeps “LGBT rights” scorecards for members of Congress and condemns Republican lawmakers as “anti-LGBTQ” for their positions completely unrelated to the group’s core mission, scoring them on issues such as immigration, health care, and abortion.

Scorecards aside, Trump has been one of the most gay-friendly presidents in American history, at no point being opposed to gay marriage during his presidency. In contrast, the left has vilified Pence as the administration’s most formidable “homophobe,” drawing on the vice president’s record as Indiana’s governor. But as the Washington Examiner’s Brad Polumbo points out, while Pence might not be as willing to openly celebrate pride by waving a rainbow flag as Trump has, Pence is certainly no homophobe, and a Pence administration is unlikely to be much different from the Trump administration in regards to gay rights. As vice president, Pence has even backed the current administration’s efforts to decriminalize homosexuality around the globe.

But of all the fearmongering among LGBT groups surrounding Pence, it’s ironic that the Human Rights Campaign would endorse the extreme measure of impeachment, replacing Trump with a President Pence.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/01/human-rights-campaign-endorses-trump-impeachment-that-would-make-mike-pence-president/,2019-10-01
What Democrat Presidential Candidates Will Say At The LGBT Town Hall,"It has been well-documented that today’s popular moralistic crusades have a strong religious character, especially for candidates in the Democratic presidential primary. On topics such as abortion, climate change, and LGBT issues, the far-left bent of the Democratic Party requires candidates to do a thorough examination of conscience, generally followed by a public display of repentance. Take, for example, Joe Biden’s apology tour, an apparent requirement before he even announced his candidacy.

We’ve already had the television town halls on climate change, and Planned Parenthood has a solid lockdown on abortion orthodoxy, so the next primary gauntlet is the CNN LGBTQ Democratic presidential debate, hosted by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) on Oct. 10. Groups like HRC have moved the goalposts extremely far left in a very short amount of time on this issue. Not only will candidates have pasts to atone for, but they’ll be expected to show that they ascribe to current LGBT orthodoxy, no matter how radical.

Given the nature of the topic, this particular display of moral fervor will likely look more like a bad Monty Python skit than a genuine religious experience. So here’s a little preview of what we might expect as the candidates vie for the title of “Wokest of Them All.” Just remember, no matter how crazy it all seems, the next time a Democrat is inaugurated president, we’ll all be living under the LGBT canon law.

Joe Biden

Already on the defensive after calling Vice President Mike Pence a “decent guy,” because apparently such a benign comment is beyond the pale for today’s political discourse on the left, Biden will surely need some extreme remarks in order to repent for his past sins. If the recent Iowa LGBTQ Forum sideshow was any indication, LGBT activists may forgive, but they never forget. Biden found himself in the hot seat over several past acts, including when the host questioned whether him referring to Pence as “decent” is an indication that he might compromise with Republicans on LGBT issues.

Apparently, presiding over a same-sex wedding wasn’t enough to show his devotion. That was 2016. It’s 2019, and if Biden wants to get with the times, he should be volunteering to referee a track and field meet that pits biological boys against girls. He needs that photo op, applauding as boys easily cinch the top spots while college scouts look on. And definitely no religious freedom for Christians.

Pete Buttigieg

The first openly gay presidential candidate represents a particularly interesting paradox in this showdown. You would think that as groups such as HRC keep a tally of the number of LGBT political leaders elected, they would be all in on the first gay president.

Yet as Democratic candidates line up to portray themselves as the furthest left on LGBT issues, a 2019 poll found that 87 percent of LGBT people think Mayor Pete’s sexual orientation will actually be a stumbling block in the general election, even in turning out the Democratic vote. It seems he’s cracked open that uniquely leftist Pandora’s box of intersectionality — the only gay candidate doesn’t even have the full support of LGBT people due to his “white male-ness.” This is not a joke.

Take it from this Huffington Post writer, who says Buttigieg is “exposing tensions in the LGBTQ community between gay white men, who benefit from the economic and social privileges of being white men, and all the other queer people who don’t.” Or as this Slate writer puts it: “Has Buttigieg faced setbacks or barriers to success because he’s gay? … Would a win for Buttigieg be as historically significant and culturally meaningful as a win for a member of an underrepresented race or gender?” It’s a provocative question to entertain in the midst of a debate designed to portray LGBT people as an aggrieved and suffering minority.

An interesting challenge awaits Mayor Pete. As all of the other candidates talk about their gay friends or non-binary family members (as did Cory Booker), is Buttigieg supposed to talk about his black friends or his low-income second cousin? No matter how he plays it, poor Mayor Pete just won’t be able to escape those pesky facts of his sex and race, assigned to him at birth by some know-it-all doctor.

Amy Klobuchar

This senator from Minnesota should have some surprises in store no matter what she says in the debate, given that she has yet to say much at all on the subject. A slow evolutionist on marriage, she finally voiced her support for same-sex marriage following President Obama’s switcheroo in 2012. Of course, actions speak louder than words, and Klobuchar has officially decided to throw her fellow females under the bus as a co-sponsor of the Equality Act.

Beto O’Rourke

Beto seems to be ahead of the game, having released a comprehensive plan back in June explaining all of the ways he would gut the legal rights of women, children, and religious people. Forcing schools to let boys in girls’ locker rooms and to allow boys on girls sports teams, shutting down Christian adoption agencies and displacing their foster children, and forcing Catholic hospitals to do sex-change surgeries are all high priorities for O’Rourke. All of these actions would be accomplished under the Equality Act, which all of the Democrat presidential candidates have vowed to sign, but they can also be done through executive action.

Beto has vowed to make them a priority, but if the last years of the Obama administration were any indication, these items will be a priority no matter which Democrat is elected. If O’Rourke wants to stand out, he’s going to have to get even more creative.

Cory Booker

Like Cory Booker! The New Jersey senator is gunning hard for the title of wokest, and the competition had better watch out. While many have lamented that LGBT activists make up words and expect the rest of us to use them, Booker is one-upping them by making up words that even LGBT activists don’t know.

In a recent interview with a transgender activist, Booker took the chance to educate everyone, including his host, on the terminology for his young, non-binary relative Avery: “niephew.” That’s “a combination of niece and nephew,” he explained to all of us folks still living in the dark ages.

But take heart — even someone as woke as Booker makes mistakes from time to time, like when he referred to his “niephew” as “she” in the same breath as “they.” Anyway, he’ll surely get credit for trying. Pronouns are hard these days.

Kamala Harris Versus Elizabeth Warren

Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren curiously share the same stain on their otherwise glossy LGBT rights records, and it’s a doozy. Are you ready for this one? Opposition to state-funded sex-reassignment surgery for incarcerated transgender women (men who identify as women).

That’s right. More than 12 million children live in families that can’t afford enough food, but these two Democrats are now arguing that taxpayers should pay for convicted murderers to get fake boobs.

Julián Castro

As the secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Obama, Castro spent much of his time at HUD removing safe spaces for abused, homeless women. By opening homeless shelters on the basis of people’s stated gender identity rather than sex, he made sure traumatized women fleeing sex trafficking or abusive relationships should have to sleep near and shower with biological men if those men simply say they’re women.

However, Castro already had one misgendering mishap on the big debate stage, when he touted his support for taxpayer-funded abortions for “trans females.” (Lest you are not woke enough to understand, trans females are men who identify as women). It’s an easy mistake to understand, though, because according to the transgender activists in charge of writing the woke bible, men who identify as women actually are women, and women who identify as men are men. What Castro really meant to say was that he supports taxpayer-funded abortions for pregnant men — because science.

In other news, his fellow candidate Buttigieg has yet to comment on whether it would be equally disturbing to find the remains of 2,000 aborted babies in his neighborhood abortionist’s garage if they came from transgender men, or if he would find that socially acceptable.

Sadly, Kirsten “Gay Rights!” Gillibrand didn’t make it this far.

Left Exploits Inaccurate Stories Of Transgender Victims For Political Gain,"For the last several years, it has become common to see headlines sounding the alarm that violence against transgender people is at crisis levels. This is especially true of men living as women who aren’t white. Each year we see rolling counts of how many transgender people have been murdered “so far” this year.

The issue has become a rite of passage for Democratic presidential candidates and was featured in the recent Democratic debates focusing on LGBTQ issues. When asked what she planned to do for LGBTQ Americans during her first 100 days in office, Sen. Elizabeth Warren answered by reading the names of several transgender people reported as murdered. Warren concluded, “It is time for a president of the United States of America to say their names.”

What Happened to Muhlaysia Booker?

One name that has become a prominent representation of the reported crisis is Muhlaysia Booker. In April 2019, Booker became a celebrated activist after a video of a group of people brutally beating Booker was widely shared on social media. A month later, Booker was found shot to death on a street in Dallas, Texas.

On Oct. 4, 2019, ABC News tweeted out a “Nightline” profile of Booker’s story with a video of friends and family sharing memories. It also included a brief clip of the beating without context. To the observer, it appears Booker was targeted for mob violence and then murdered because Booker was a transgender person.

The details behind the beating do not support this portrayal, however. In April, Booker accidentally backed into another car, and the driver drove Booker off the road in an attempt to prevent Booker from fleeing. According to Booker, the other driver pointed a gun at Booker and demanded payment for the damage to his car before he would allow Booker to leave. A crowd gathered around the altercation, and an unidentified person offered Edward Dominic Thomas, 29, $200 to beat Booker.

The video of the incident shows multiple men violently attacking Booker as a large crowd surrounds them, shouting and cheering. Although Out Magazine indicated the video shows bystanders hurling homophobic and misogynistic slurs and Booker reported the attackers used homophobic slurs, the video did not clearly indicate it, nor did the police confirm it. During an interview with police, Thomas admitted to the assault but claimed not to have engaged in any derogatory language toward the victim. Thomas has since been arrested and is awaiting trial for the assault.

Police arrested Booker’s possible murderer in connection with a string of other murders in the area. CBS News referred to the accused as a serial killer. According to Dallas police, Kendrell Lavar Lyles, 34, was known to frequent an area where transgender people sell sex. On May 18, 2019, three hours before her death, witnesses say Booker got into Lyles’ car on this street.

Lyles was already charged for two other murders when police made the connection thanks to his possession of Booker’s cell phone. He is believed to have murdered three people during the month of May, including one woman he knew personally and a woman he planned to sell illegal drugs to via facebook. A second transgender person was reported as his fourth victim, but police have now determined that person committed suicide.

Dishonesty About Transgender Victims

Another woman was murdered in the same area about the same time, after being stabbed multiple times, and in October, a gay man in drag, who was incorrectly identified by police as a transgender woman, was found fatally shot in a parked car. The young man, Traylon Brown, preferred to go out in drag to pick up men, and his mother believes his murder was the result of a burglary and not “hate.”

Booker’s family also said they do not believe Booker was targeted for being transgender. Booker’s aunt told local reporters she believes police are simply trying to “satisfy” the public with these connections but she thinks the murder was over a personal dispute.

High-profile and LGBT advocacy media have not reported any of these details, nor the context of the local area in which multiple unrelated murders have recently occurred. The fact that Booker was initially the victim of a road rage incident in which a career criminal held Booker at gunpoint and then he and his group publicly beat Booker over a fender-bender, and the fact that Booker was then murdered by a likely serial killer targeting the area Booker worked in, seem irrelevant to the narrative. But Booker’s story tells us a great deal about the threat of gang and drug violence in urban areas and the high risks of prostitutio, but it tells us nothing about any specific threat to transgender women, of color or otherwise.

When Warren expressed a need for political leaders to “say the names” of transgender victims, the symbolic action strengthened the idea that, as ABC News puts it, “Saying their names out loud served as a larger call for attention and action to an issue that largely goes underreported.” The Human Rights Campaign reported 145 murders of transgender people since 2013 but lamented the violence is “hard to track due to misgendering — incorrectly applying gender labels — and transphobia.”

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., has specifically called for trans-specific protections to address the issue. But a look at news reporting betrays this notion. Since the initial assault, Muhlaysia Booker has been cited nearly 350 times in world media. The judge in the upcoming trail of Thomas, the man accused of beating Booker in the traffic incident, specifically required the use of the victim’s preferred name rather than Booker’s birth name. The primary concern was ensuring the jury did not view the incident as a “fight between two men” but rather as a man beating a woman.

In the effort to force an emotional narrative that simply refuses to be true, LGBT advocacy and the media place the vulnerable lives they seek to bring awareness to in more danger. The media’s focus on the racial attributes of the victims, as ABC News did, saying, “Trans women of color particularly are at steep risk of marginalization, violence, and erasure,” further diminishes the issue. The assumption is that nonwhite trans people are more often targeted because of their race when, in fact, the known assailants largely share their racial attributes. They have given us nothing to “act” against.

Democrats’ Transgender Narrative Is Political Marketing

What trans-specific protections would have saved Booker’s life? Vox even articulated this concern by arguing policies that remove sex work online force prostitutes onto the streets, where they are in far more physical danger. The threat is environmental, not social.

The only reason Booker’s name is so well known compared to the other people her alleged killer also allegedly murdered is Booker’s usefulness to the current LGBT message of fear and panic. Sadly, Booker’s own life choices, environment, and the truth seem far less interesting to advocacy groups who feel entitled to exploit Booker’s life for political marketing.

The ongoing reporting of transgender murders as a collective pattern of hatred and targeted violence is a powerful tool the Democratic Party is using to emotionally manipulate voters into believing they alone can somehow protect vulnerable Americans. But the truth is absolutely nothing can be done that is not already in place that would specifically protect transgender people from the same violence women face in dangerous environments related to domestic abuse, sex work, drugs, or living in high-crime areas.

This violence is not somehow more of a critical issue when it happens to a person who is also transgender. Diminishing the lives of non-transgender victims does nothing to further the cause of equality. Neither does manipulating the facts to make the public believe there is a specific threat that one political party exaggerates and the other resolves.

The lives of these victims will never be honored as long as they are exploited for a false narrative only used to spread fear and hatred. Saying their names to bring awareness to the true violence at hand is positive. Doing so to perpetuate a lie is cruel.

What The First Nonbinary American Wants The Supreme Court To Know,"The U.S. Supreme Court hears a landmark case on gender identity and sex Tuesday, in oral arguments for R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. James Shupe offered his perspective in an amicus brief for that case.

The following is an interview between me and Shupe, who made waves for being the first “legally non-binary person” in the United States. Shupe achieved clarity through therapy, and returned to life as his birth sex even though the LGBT community shunned him. He’s begun to share his story and speak out against the dangers of transgender medicine.

In 2016, an Oregon circuit court ruled Shupe could change his gender to nonbinary, the first legal ruling of his kind. LGBT activists lauded it as a landmark decision that now plagues Shupe.

Here’s a closer look at his experience living as the opposite sex, regretting it, returning to live as his birth sex, and becoming a vocal opponent of transgender medicine altogether. This transcript has been edited for clarity and length.

For readers who may be unaware of your journey, describe why you decided to become the “first legally non-binary person” in the United States?

I experienced a major mental health crisis at age 49. I began researching psychiatric issues on the internet. It didn’t take very long for me to stumble upon gender identity disorder, transgenderism, and transsexualism.

At first, I was skeptical that I could actually be a female based on this newly discovered thing called “gender identity,” something I’d never heard of before because I’d always understood myself to be a male. But numerous medical and media articles describing mental health issues disappearing after undergoing a gender transition quickly convinced me that I was a woman and that transition would fix me. I also discovered the Department of Veterans Affairs had a newly launched transgender medical care program [that] erased all of my doubts completely.

At the time, I was especially vulnerable to being duped into believing that I was actually a female trapped in a male body despite not feeling like one for two reasons. 1) I had fragile mental health and was desperate for a cure. 2) During my military career, I’d often cross-dressed for sexual pleasure and had an attraction for men while dressed as a woman, a problem I’d acted out on during several occasions.

So this newly discovered information about being a female because of gender identity based on “feeling like a woman” was a much more palatable explanation for what I had previously understood my behavior to be per military regulations: transvestism.

So, armed with this new information and false beliefs about myself, I immediately began identifying as a transgender woman, mimicking the role of a stereotypical female, and taking female hormones. I also planned to undergo a vaginoplasty surgery to have my penis cosmetically reshaped into a vagina. I was born in 1963, so I’m older than the theory of gender identity, a term first used for transsexuals in 1966 when John Hopkins opened their gender clinic.

Unfortunately, all of this turned out to be delusional thinking. By the end of the charade, I’d come to the realization that my sex change was a failure and a hoax and by then I was just as desperate to escape being legally classified as female as I was previously was to solve my mental health problems.

After a good-faith period of participation in the grand gender experiment, I came to believe the whole thing was smoke and mirrors, complete quackery. By then I knew I wasn’t a female and like others before me, I had similarly discovered by trial and error that changing your sex is impossible. You could say that becoming non-binary gave me the means to save face and as a byproduct, I became famous for doing so.

What does it mean to become non-binary?

Like everything else with gender, non-binary is a made-up term. It’s a “catch-all” terminology for all of the transgender identities that fall outside of male and female. It can mean anything from you think of yourself as transmasculine or transfeminine, or neither male or female, or even a combination of the two.

How long did it take before you realized your quest to become non-binary was actually a result of trauma?

It wasn’t until late 2018 and early 2019 after two psychiatric hospitalizations that I was able to face up to the truth about myself and my sexual behaviors. Once I was willing to do that, I became familiarized with what Dr. Ray Blanchard had correctly theorized about men like me decades ago: that I am sexually attracted and aroused by the idea of myself as a female.

Dr. Blanchard claims there are two types of transgender women: homosexuals attracted to men, and men who are attracted to the thought or image of themselves as females. The latter is the most prominent population group in western countries, and sadly that’s the motivation for all of these middle-aged men such as myself who begin to believe they are women after what’s essentially a sexual fetish has been undiagnosed, gone untreated, or been misdiagnosed as gender dysphoria, and has then escalated and developed into an alter ego female personality.

First, my sexual behaviors were a coping mechanism for my very painful mental health issues that were rooted in the trauma of my childhood sexual abuse as well as violence I’d experienced and witnessed. Second, I was also now feeding what had become an escalating sexual addiction that was being fueled by pornography and yet another sexual paraphilia I’d developed: masochism. Experts in these fields of expertise state that sexual paraphilias are often comorbid and I agree.

Who bears the blame for your transition? You? Your doctors?

I’ve gotten feedback that insinuates that I got exactly what I asked for from my medical providers during my two gender transitions. But the truth is my doctors and mental health professionals bear significant blame, because the work of Blanchard and others on autogynephilia was published all the way back in the 1980s, yet most psychologists and psychiatrists either know nothing about it or intentionally chose ignorance. It’s framed as an unpopular diagnosis.

When I confronted my caregivers at the VA that had rubber-stamped me with gender dysphoria instead of a sexual paraphilia and asked to be reevaluated, their response was to fire me as a patient and then claim that they had no experience treating sexual paraphilias. However, the VA has already done studies explaining why people like me are acting out sexually but the folks treating me didn’t put two and two together. Instead, they fed and enabled the delusion that I was a woman, making them the most culpable.

Describe when and how you realized you needed to “de-transition.”

Becoming non-binary was like redoing the whole gender experiment all over again with different parameters and then getting the same outcome. I didn’t stop taking hormones and by then I had an even bigger mess to walk back because I was no longer a relatively obscure transgender woman. I now had international fame associated with the landmark court decision to cope with, making reclaiming my birth sex much more difficult.

But admitting and accepting the truth about myself gave me the strength to reclaim my male birth sex. And after I did, I began treatment for my correct diagnosis: a transvestic disorder with autogynephilia.

What does “de-transitioning” feel like? Is there a feeling of loss? Anger? Relief? Is it harder than transitioning?

There was no sense of loss and it’s certainly easier than transitioning because you’re not fighting against your biological reality, societal pushback, and forcing others to indulge your delusion.

I do have plenty of anger about having been medically experimented on by people with advanced degrees who should have known better, leaving me feeling duped about having fallen for the quack theory that I have a gender identity. I now realize that I don’t.

I was falsely led by mental health practitioners to believe that my feelings decided my sex, but that’s neither scientific, measurable, nor enduring because my feelings can and have changed. I’ve come to realize and accept that the only thing capable of reliably grounding me to reality is my male chromosomes and reproductive system.

All of this legal fiction and outright fraud has indeed left me very bitter and angry. I want the people who have caused me physical and mental harm held accountable for their actions and roles in the medical experimentation that was perpetrated against me.

Do you believe most people who have decided they are transgender would have been better off remaining their biological sex?

Yes, I believe everyone would be better off being recognized solely as their biological sex. The medical procedures being touted as “gender transitions,” if they work at all, are in fact nothing more than cosmetic changes to people’s bodies. I’m proof of that.

But here’s the biggest thing: even if you could somehow argue the medical treatments are legitimate hormonal and surgical procedures, lying to the patient about being another sex based on the pseudoscience of gender identity and forcing everyone else to play along is nothing short of medical malpractice and legal fiction.

How did you decide to go from a non-binary person who has de-transitioned to somewhat of a public critic? Is your personal story well received?

First and foremost I had to do so because people were continuing to use my court decision to put more and more non-binary sex markers on state driver’s licenses, and they were also continuing to write about my court case in academic and legal journals. And this was occurring against a backdrop of readily available information on the internet, my Wikipedia page, and on my personal website explaining that I had reclaimed my birth sex. Some of these folks were intentionally casting me in a false light to advance gender ideology.

What are your expectations for the case SCOTUS is about to hear, R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as it relates to your personal journey? Should gender identity be protected under the law like sex?

I think the justices will rule in favor of R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes and protect religious freedom because the male plaintiff, who claims to be a female is, in my opinion, the exact same thing as I am: A cross-dressing man that is sexually aroused by the image of himself as a woman. I sincerely believe that he and I both suffer from a transvestic disorder and with what Dr. Blanchard refers to as autogynephilia.

While I believe that autogynephilia is a mental health problem worthy of treatment and compassion, based on my experience I think it’s unworthy of public or employment accommodation, even if it has progressed to gender dysphoria.

Like myself, because the man in the case who now identifies as a woman’s transvestic disorder has apparently gone untreated for probably decades, and because quack theories about gender have been allowed to proliferate and infiltrate society and law, his sexual identity problem has apparently gotten so out of control that he now believes he’s a female. That’s unfortunate, but he’s not a woman and neither was I. So I feel the Supreme Court needs to set the nation straight about that in order to protect females and religious freedom.

We need to quit wasting so much time and resources and return to a clear-cut definition of biological sex because a lot of children are now being harmed by gender ideology too. As to whether gender should be protected under the law? The answer is no, because it’s based on nothing more than personal feelings, perceptions, stereotypes, and pseudoscience.

How Illinois Schools Teach Preschoolers To Celebrate Transgenderism,"Starting July 1, 2020, all Illinois public schools are legally required to teach children LGBT history and only buy textbooks that include the topic. NPR affiliate Illinois Public Radio labeled Christian and conservative opposition to this law while it was being considered as stemming from “hate groups.”

The explicit goal of such laws, which are also in place in California, Colorado, New Jersey, and Oregon, is to make children agree with the left’s views of sexuality, which contradict the historic views of all major world religions. This is not only the open, stated goal of those pushing such laws but also explicit in the curriculum.

“Imagine a generation of Illinois students having learned the positive contributions of LGBTQ people to U.S., Illinois, world history,” Brian Johnson, CEO of the advocacy group Equality Illinois, told IPR. “I think it’s only going to have a positive effect on our society’s view of LGBTQ people.”

“This has the potential to change the way society views the LGBT community. Who we decide to talk about and who we include in history reflects the values we have in our society,” said Democrat state Rep. Anna Moeller, the new law’s lead sponsor, to the local newspaper Daily Herald.

“We have an incredibly diverse student body, which leads to more inclusiveness and tolerance,” Chicago-area public school teacher Leslie Schock told the Daily Herald in response to Illinois’s new LGBT curriculum requirements. “The kids don’t really question why it’s important to them. For the most part, throughout their entire childhood, gay marriage has been legalized.”

A Brown University study last year found indications that an identity politics-saturated environment can fuel a “social contagion” of children identifying as transgender. Scholar Mary Eberstadt has written in great detail about how upending boundaries around sex undermines children’s faith. Loss of faith, as well as sexual profligacy, is correlated with a host of social problems including mental illness, family chaos, government dependence, violence, and lawlessness.

AP and District 65 Offer a Preview of Coming Instruction

To get a sense of what all Illinois public schools must begin teaching children starting next year, one can look at curriculum developed this summer in Illinois’s Evanston/Skokie School District 65, as well as Advanced Placement history classes. Scholars noted AP products were given a decidedly leftist, identity politics slant in recent revisions. These classes educate the nation’s top third of students and for many are the last history classes they ever take. Especially well-educated and high-income parents trust them as a way to get their kids a leg up on college and thus life.

Yet they are rapidly being corrupted by leftist ideology. Schock noted that she was teaching LGBT-themed materials before the Illinois law passed because the College Board integrated it into AP history classes in recent revisions. “Schock teaches about the 1969 Stonewall riots for LGBTQ rights in New York City, feminism, and Latino and American Indian rights movements as part of the description of social movements of the 1960s and 1970s. She spends a class period on each topic,” reported the Daily Herald.

This means that even in states that have not mandated LGBT curriculum, bright students are likely to be exposed to it through AP classes, which also influence non-AP curriculum. The Stonewall Riots are also taught to elementary school students as part of LGBTQ+ Equity Week curriculum being taught this week in District 65, a north Chicago suburb.

The district’s Gender and Sexuality Educators’ Alliance (GSEA) noted in a Sept. 12 email sent to all staff that “This work [of the district’s Oct. 7-11 LGBTQ+ Equity Week] comes during an important time in Illinois history. A few weeks ago, Governor Pritzker signed House Bill 246 into law and as of July 1, 2020, all Illinois public schools will be required to include LGBTQ history in their curriculums [sic].” District 65 teachers earned $35 per hour to create this curriculum over the summer, according to documents The Federalist obtained from an open records request.

On Oct. 8, District 65 school board President Suni Kartha sent parents and staff a statement: “Our administration has heard from a number of parents who want the ability to opt their children out of this curriculum. The District 65 Board of Education does not support allowing students to opt out of this or any curriculum that seeks to include a more complete account of the role of historically marginalized people in our society, as such curriculum is vital to supporting our district mission of preparing students to contribute positively to a global and diverse society.”

Adhering to intersectionality requires saturating all classes with identity politics at all times. The district is also making sure children receive LGBT instruction all year long, not just in one week, as the teachers who wrote the LGBTQ+ Equity Week curriculum also developed “modular resources to support teachers who choose to include LGBTQ+ identities in their curriculum throughout the remainder of the year,” according to district documents. Of course, even children parents might keep home from school for this one week are otherwise in class every day with teachers and peers who attended, and children talk.

How Do Teachers Feel About This? District Won’t Say

The district’s parents are wealthier and hold a higher percentage of college degrees than the overall U.S. population, with a $101,047 median household income and 70 percent who have obtained at least a bachelor’s degree, according to federal data. District 65 manages 7,997 students, ages 3 to 14, and spends $18,649 per student per year, according to the most recent federal data.

Evanston/Skokie School District 65 only encompasses preK-8 students. For this group of largely prepubescent children, since spring the district has been planning an October 7-11 “week of curriculum [that] seeks to address and affirm intersectional identities that encompass a combination of race, gender, and/or sexuality,” according to a May 3 email from district official Sophie Leventhal.

In preparation for this week-long celebration of National Coming Out Day on October 11, Levanthal asked all district employees to fill out a survey. That survey asked staff to rate, on a scale of 1 to 5, “How comfortable are you teaching and discussing LGBTQ+ curriculum?” “Are you open to growing in comfort, knowledge, and preparedness in order to effectively teach & discuss LGBTQ+ curriculum?” and “How supported do you feel by district leaders specifically around LGBTQ+ equity?”

All of these were required questions in order to complete the survey, which is available in full here. The district refused to supply the answers teachers provided, claiming results obtained five months ago are “predecisional.”

What Evanston/Skokie Schools Are Teaching Preschoolers

District 65’s full LGBTQ+ week curriculum can be viewed online. To get a sense of of what this public school district is teaching the children in its care, and what the new LGBT curriculum in all Illinois public schools will look like starting next school year, let’s look at a few selections from their preschool and kindergarten curriculum for this week. This is for children ages 3 to 5.

Teachers were given a lesson plan on slides that include movies and a teaching script to show and say to the children each day of the week. The children are shown, among other things, a video of someone reading aloud the book “Heather Has Two Mommies,” famous transgender teen Jazz Jenning reading his picture book “I Am Jazz,” a book read aloud on video called “My Princess Boy,” and the apparently highly awarded video below. The script tells teachers to use materials like these throughout the year, not just during LGBTQ+ Equity Week.

The curriculum teaches preschoolers and kindergarteners to compare mixed-race and adoptive families with families headed by same-sex couples and even possibly a polyamorous family — in this part of the video captured below, the boy says “My two moms are Marilyn and Adrian and my two dads are Michael and Barry.” It’s not explained what his two moms and dads call their arrangement. Maybe that’s considered too risque for three-year-olds.

The children are also openly catechized in LGBT affirmations. For example, the script tells the teacher to say after one video: “OK. Let’s see what we learned. For each picture, you tell me if this is a family. Ready?” The children are clearly expected to say “Yes” to each.

The curriculum also introduces three-year-olds to the concepts of “lesbian,” “gay,” and “transgender.” In the slide below, the teacher script below the image directs teachers to tell the children, “If students say it is not a family, review definition – people who love you and care for you. When they say yes, agree! Yes some families have 2 moms.”

The script for the slide below directs teachers to tell preschoolers and kindergarteners, “Sometimes people use their bodies to help them know their gender, and some people know their gender in their heart.”



Other parts of the curriculum suggest to these small children that enjoying dress-up, playing with “boy toys” or “girl toys,” or loving people of either sex or both sexes might mean they are gay or transgender. It also tells children that clothes communicate nothing about one’s sex.

In the video of Jennings reading “I Am Jazz,” he tells the preschoolers that being transgender means “having a girl brain but a boy body.” After reading, he also looks into the camera and tells the children “you can be just like Jazz.”

Special Needs Children Not Left Out

The LGBT curriculum also contains lessons for children classified as special needs. It includes the following slides. The following slide’s teacher script says: “Everyone has a sexual orientation! This is not just something for someone in the LGBTQ+ community.”

The following slide’s teacher script says: “Everyone has a gender identity! This is not just something for someone in the LGBTQ+ community.”

It also introduces K-8 special-needs children to various forms of sex and plenty of people and organizations to Google.

Special-needs kids also see this video about a “gender-fluid” 11-year-old.

Putting the Squeeze on Parents, Teachers

District 65 provided teachers a document from LGBT activist group Welcoming Schools that explains why parents do not need to be informed of these curriculum materials ahead of time: “In many states there are specific regulations for parental notification when the school curriculum addresses sexuality. However, when educators discuss family diversity, it is family — children’s families — that are being discussed. ” It has become standard for school districts to teach LGBT material outside of sex ed, because sex ed typically operates under regulations such as parental notification and opt-out.

In a “Staff Guide,” the district tells teachers that students need to learn the right ideology to be financially successful.

Cultural competency is a 21st century skill that students will need to enter the workforce. We see daily examples of how intolerant thinking compromises the professional success of the people around us. Whether the conversation be about race, religion, language, gender, or sexuality, adults and students must be prepared to participate in conversations using facts and relevant vocabulary instead of myths, stereotypes, and slurs.

The district gave teachers more scripts to use in another document from Welcoming Schools about marriage. It says teachers should tell students about marriage that “People can fall in love and want to be in a relationship, no matter their gender.” And here’s a sample Q&A with a student: “‘Can Jorge’s dads get married? I thought two men couldn’t get married.’ ‘Yes, his dads can get married. The U.S. Supreme Court decided in a court case that all the states should allow people of the same gender to get married.’”

The Staff Guide also tells school administrators how to behave during LGBTQ+ Week: “Encourage people to be unafraid of backlash diving into this work and that you will answer any parental concerns; Be visible and supportive.”

Evanston/Skokie is the same school district where in 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported, administrators had staff divide themselves into separate “racial identification” groups of “white” and “individuals of color” for discussions of race and racism. The district also plans a Black Lives Matter week in February 2020 and refused to release the curriculum developed for it in response to an open records request.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/09/how-illinois-schools-teach-preschoolers-to-celebrate-transgenderism/,2019-10-09
4 Wild Moments From CNN’s LGBT Presidential Town Hall,"CNN held another town hall Thursday night featuring nine Democratic presidential candidates to discuss their platforms on LGBT issues.

Former vice president Joe Biden; South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro; billionaire Tom Steyer; former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke; and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Kamala Harris of California all laid out their proposed presidential LGBT policies.

Here are but a few highlights.

1. Chris Cuomo Calls Himself A Woman

Harris opened up her segment by introducing her pronouns to the audience when coming on stage.

“My pronouns are she, her, and hers,” Harris declared.

“Mine too,” Cuomo joked in response.

Cuomo’s joke sparked immediate backlash from liberal activists upset by Cuomo’s mockery of introducing oneself with pronouns, prompting a nearly immediate apology from the primetime host after the segment.

“When Sen. Harris said her pronouns were she her and her’s, I said mine too. I should not have. I apologize,” Cuomo wrote on Twitter.

PLEASE READ: When Sen. Harris said her pronouns were she her and her's, I said mine too. I should not have. I apologize. I am an ally of the LGBTQ community, and I am sorry because I am committed to helping us achieve equality. Thank you for watching our townhall. — Christopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) October 11, 2019

2. O’Rourke: Back Gay Marriage Or Get Taxed, Bigots

O’Rourke made clear Thursday night that he believes churches should lose their tax-exemption status with the federal government if they fail to support same-sex marriage, a concept deeply at odds with the historic stances of all major world religions.

“Do you think religious institutions, like colleges, churches, charities, should they lose their tax-exempt status if they oppose same-sex marriage?” CNN’s Don Lemon asked.

“Yes,” O’Rourke answered.

3. Trans Woman To CNN Anchor: ‘You Just Committed Violence Against Me’

A transgender woman who was being introduced to ask a question of Castro criticized CNN anchor Nia Mikayla Henderson for mispronouncing her name.

“I want to bring in ‘Shay Diamond,’ a singer-songwriter from Los Angeles. She currently supports Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Shay, what’s your question?” Henderson asked.

“Uhm, it’s ‘Shia Diamond,’” an irritated Diamond clapped back. “Put that on the record… It’s violence to misgender, or to alter a name of, a trans person so let’s always get that right first.”

4. Anderson Cooper Thanks Protestors For Interrupting Primetime Event

Buttigieg’s segment with CNN’s Anderson Cooper was interrupted by transgender protestors whom Cooper was unable to calm down for quite some time on air.

After failing to quiet down, Cooper “applauded” them for speaking out and interrupting the event.

“Let me just point out there is a long and proud tradition in history in the gay lesbian and transgender community of protest and we applaud them for their protest,” Cooper said. “And they are absolutely right to be angry and upset at the lack of attention, particularly in the media.”",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/11/4-wild-moments-from-cnns-lgbt-presidential-town-hall/,2019-10-11
CNN’s LGBT Town Hall Was Progressive Propaganda,"The “historic” LGBT event on CNN for most of last night was billed as a series of town halls with nine Democratic candidates for president. Typically the purpose of a political town hall is to allow voters with a range of views to ask difficult questions exposing differences in candidates’ policies or beliefs. Nothing of the sort happened last night.

Nine times last night the same basic half hour played itself out over and over again. As former Vice President Joe Biden pointed out early on, there weren’t many differences exposed, with the possible exception of former Congressman Beto O’Rourke promising to end tax breaks for churches, mosques, and synagogues. Instead, what we saw was a ritualistic exercise meant to make every candidate, and moderator, for that matter, accept incredibly progressive shibboleths regarding LGBT issues. It was nothing more than a purity test. They all passed, except for maybe Chris Cuomo.

Each of the candidates expressed their fidelity to the belief that gender is not based in biology, but rather on gender expression, with Senator Elizabeth Warren adding that she had been wrong just seven years ago to say that the state should not pay for sex change operations. Each candidate asked supported the idea that every business should be compelled to participate in gay marriage. Given the opportunity, no one offered any opinion of Americans who hold differing views as much more than wrongheaded bigots.

Several times the event was interrupted by trans women of color accusing CNN itself of erasing them, presumably because insufficient attention was being paid to that specific issue. The protestors were coddled by the candidates and moderators, in a confessional display common to progressivism in which the most marginalized and oppressed voices may never be challenged or pushed back against.

After his performance, moderator Chris Cuomo took to twitter to apologize for joking with Kamala Harris that his pronouns are also Her/She/Hers after Harris used that progressive salutation. After all, you can’t really have a religion, which progressivism has become, which out sin and confession. And this event was very much like a church service in which the sacraments were announced and piously taken as Gospel.

But what was most troubling about CNN’s display of propaganda masking as a town hall is that none of the very serious questions that surround the LGBT community, were addressed in anything even approaching a substantive way. There was no serious discussion about pending court cases regarding biological male athletes dominating girls and women’s sports. No real discussion of how to handle who really belongs in women’s shelters. No serious debate about how young is too young for a child to transition, either socially or medically.

And how could there have been? On two occasions 9-year-old children who transitioned from female to male appeared with their mothers to ask questions of candidates. Having a child who believes they are trans ask questions about how the state and society should deal with the issue of children transition ensures no substantive discussion can be had, because no sane and sensitive person would challenge such a child. That is why we don’t have children serve in the government. It is adults’ job to make decisions for them.

CNN’s performance last night had nothing to do with the 2020 presidential campaign. It neither broke significant news, nor highlighted significant views. Its sole purpose was to prop up a set of cultural norms that progressives want to pretend have reached a consensus point. They have decidedly not. Substantial public policy issues still exist regarding sexual preference and gender identity. As do considerable conflicts between the LGBT agenda and the agenda of those who seek to defend religious liberty.

More than anything else, CNN was trying to make beliefs, and frankly science, that run counter to the progressive LGBT project appear outside the boundaries of acceptable, polite society. But it won’t work. Those who question whether 9-years-olds should take drugs to try to change their gender know they aren’t bigots. Those who question attacks on free speech regarding gendering and pronouns know they aren’t bigots. Those with serious questions about religious liberty and how society balances competing rights know they aren’t bigots.

The very purpose of the allegation of bigotry is to avoid having any of these conversations at all. Which is exactly what CNN did last night. Progressive piety demands that these conversations never be had, because even to have them, is bigotry in and of itself. That may be the position of CNN and most Democrats, but it is not the position of millions of Americans who refused to be cowed by false allegations of prejudice. And no fake CNN town hall is going to change that.

Trump Does More For Gay People Than The Stonewall Democrats Do,"There is no easier way to make the left mad than being a gay Republican. This time, it’s the Stonewall Democratic Club that’s up in arms.

Stonewall is a group of LGBT Democrats who purport to champion “equality for all.” You wouldn’t know this from their record.

Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and Don’t Ask Don’t Tell (DADT) during his first term. These acts outlawed gay marriage and military service for openly LGBT soldiers, respectively. It took 20 years to undo that codified discrimination. But Stonewall endorsed Clinton for reelection in 1996 anyway.

Barack Obama ran for president in 2008 opposing gay marriage. Stonewall endorsed him nonetheless. From 2008 to 2010, although Democrats controlled both the White House and Congress, Obama did nothing to advance LGBT equality. Stonewall endorsed him again in 2012.

Recently, the Stonewall Democrats of San Antonio terrorized a Hispanic gay Republican running for Congress in Texas, threatening “economic sanctions” against the gay nightclub he owns unless he leaves the race.

Despite this shameful history, Stonewall’s Ryan Basham recently wrote an article condemning the Log Cabin Republicans for endorsing Donald Trump. We at Log Cabin represent LGBT conservatives and allies. Our endorsement is the latest addition to a record that is actually far superior to Stonewall’s.

Log Cabin’s Better Record on Gay Issues

While Stonewall was cheerleading Obama’s do-nothing Democrats, Log Cabin sued the government to kill DADT. In 2010, Log Cabin won an injunction preventing the administration from enforcing DADT. Only after fighting that injunction, and losing, did Obama finally repeal the law.

Log Cabin has also withheld its endorsement from high-profile Republican candidates who opposed marriage equality — unlike Stonewall, we resist partisan groupthink, even when it costs us. We wouldn’t be endorsing President Trump in 2020 if he weren’t truly an ally.

Trump openly supported LGBT equality before any of Stonewall’s endorsees did. In 1999, while Democrats defended DADT, Trump opined that gays and lesbians serving openly was “not something that would disturb me.” In 2000, Trump proposed an amendment of civil rights law to ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, which would have rendered moot the employment discrimination case currently before the Supreme Court.

In 2015, though Trump needed religious conservative votes to win the Republican primary, he nevertheless stated publicly that religious freedom and LGBT rights are not “mutually exclusive.” He even rebuked his running mate-to-be, Mike Pence, for initially undervaluing LGBT interests in Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, on which Pence ultimately reversed. Today, President Trump still has our back.

Stonewall Incorrectly Attacks President Trump

Stonewall’s article censures Russia for orchestrating “an industrial-scale genocide of gay men” in Chechnya. Russia’s behavior is indeed alarming. So President Trump, collaborating with his (gay) Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, has launched a historic initiative to decriminalize homosexuality worldwide. Basham conveniently omits this fact. (Incidentally, our Los Angeles chapter dedicated Pride Month in 2018 to raising awareness and money for Rainbow Railroad, a nonprofit that rescues gay men from Chechnya. Stonewall used its Pride booth that year to promote itself.)

Stonewall calls Trump’s plan to reduce HIV/AIDS transmission by 90 percent within 10 years “lip service” because HIV+ immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border are separated from other immigrants. But this policy is intended to provide HIV+ immigrants, some of whom face untreated AIDS, with needed medical care. Stonewall also neglects to mention that Trump’s budget included $291 million to fight HIV in 2020 alone. Trump also convinced the antiviral research group Gilead to donate billions of dollars of HIV prevention medication for 200,000 people. That is hardly lip service.

Stonewall further insinuates, ludicrously, that Trump is bigoted for halting Obama-era attempts to tell public schools which bathroom transgender students can use. We say, good: The well-being of children who do not identify with their biological sex is vitally important, but it does not fall under the originally intended purview of Title IX and would thus be better explored at the state and local level without federal intervention. Executive overreach in the name of LGBT rights does nothing to recommend our cause.

Nor is attacking religious freedom, as Basham does, a good look for gays. We will get nowhere by forcing religious people to bake cakes for our weddings. The majority of LGBT people are religious themselves — Log Cabin therefore supports the First Amendment because religious rights are LGBT rights.

Many Trump Supporters Are LGBT

So Stonewall is wrong. But something more important is going on here. What really infuriates Basham is that Log Cabin has “given cover” for the president’s claim that “some of [his] biggest supporters” are LGBT. As if saying so were a crime Trump commits in secrecy while his fabulous gay accomplices at Log Cabin run interference. But it’s just a fact: Many of Trump’s most fervent supporters are LGBT people.

Left-wing gay activists, however, depend on creating the impression that all LGBT people are Democrats. Democrats then use this false narrative to consolidate unearned moral authority. That is why, when the prominent gay billionaire Peter Thiel expressed support for Trump, The Advocate promptly ran a piece arguing he isn’t actually gay — he just has sex with men. (Really. They did that. Look it up.)

The point of such chicanery is to insinuate that all Republicans are homophobes, and all homophobes are Republicans. That only works if Democrats speak for all gays. So just one prominent gay or trans Republican punctures the lie that the left has a monopoly on gay rights.

Log Cabin Republicans stand to disabuse the public of that lie. The Stonewall Democrats don’t want you to know we exist. But we do, our ideas are better than theirs, and we’re not going anywhere.

The Supreme Court Won't Stop Beto's Crusade To Punish Religion,"In 2003, the Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia made a rather prophetic statement in his dissenting opinion in Lawrence v. Texas (2003), a Supreme Court ruling that struck down anti-sodomy laws across the country. After excoriating the majority for simply waving away the long-held notion that sodomy was a form of sexual immorality that the state had a legitimate interest in prohibiting, Scalia wrote:

One of the benefits of leaving regulation of this matter to the people rather than to the courts is that the people, unlike judges, need not carry things to their logical conclusion. The people may feel that their disapprobation of homosexual conduct is strong enough to disallow homosexual marriage, but not strong enough to criminalize private homosexual acts — and may legislate accordingly. The Court today pretends that it possesses a similar freedom of action, so that that we need not fear judicial imposition of homosexual marriage. … Do not believe it.

In other words, Scalia was declaring, “It’s not within the nature of courts to remain neutral on moral issues. By declaring that the government can’t prohibit homosexual acts today, the court is guaranteeing that the government will be celebrating homosexual acts tomorrow.”

A mere 12 years later, the Supreme Court, via Obergefell v. Hodges, declared every state prohibition against same-sex marriage unconstitutional, with Justice Anthony Kennedy justifying the majority’s opinion by lauding the beauty of homosexual relationships. While Scalia’s words did indeed prove prophetic, they were not perfectly so.

Legalizing gay marriage may have been taking the court’s logic to the next logical step, but it wasn’t the logical conclusion of declaring that the state can’t punish those who engage in homosexuality. Rather, the logical conclusion of the court’s judgment in Lawrence is saying the state must punish those still clinging to the former orthodoxy.

O’Rourke Shows Left’s Trajectory on LGBT Issues

This is something presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke demonstrated in a recent CNN forum on LGBT issues. When Don Lemon asked him if churches and religious organizations that oppose same-sex marriage should lose their tax-exempt status, O’Rourke replied with a firm “Yes.”

Then O’Rourke explained his position by stating, “There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone or any institution, any organization in America, that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us. So as president, we’re going to make that a priority, and we are going to stop those who are infringing upon the human rights of our fellow Americans.”

While one might dismiss O’Rourke as an outlier, it’s worth noting that his response met cheers from the audience and tepid disavowals from a few of his fellow would-be Democrat nominees who couldn’t sufficiently explain why they disagreed, indicating the former congressman’s position is more mainstream among leftists than we might think, even if many on the left recognize it’s not wise to state that view publicly.

Quite simply, O’Rourke’s plan to tax religious groups opposed to same-sex marriage is not merely the hard-left pandering of an unserious candidate trying desperately to bring his poll numbers above negative-400 percent. It’s the logical conclusion of the illiberal philosophy embraced in Lawrence.

Yesterday the state said homosexuality is neutral. Today the state says homosexuality is good. Tomorrow the state will say opposing homosexuality is bad and must therefore be punished. While O’Rourke’s position may be too hot for the eventual nominee to embrace right now, don’t be surprised if it becomes the official platform of the Democratic National Committee the moment it becomes clear they can win the presidency while giving churches, synagogues, and mosques the sin tax treatment.

In addition to showing the left’s trajectory on religious freedom, O’Rourke’s comments also reveal why conservatives are faring so poorly on the LGBT front of the culture war.

While most Americans would probably describe their general approach to human sexuality as “live and let live,” most Americans also intuitively understand that the “live and let live” doctrine gets complicated when people’s sexual practices and identities follow them into public places. When that messiness arises, both conservatives and progressives have the chance to convince people that their respective solutions will get things tidied up. Why, then, are conservatives losing so many of these battles for the hearts and minds of the general public?

The Folly of ‘Live and Let Live’

To answer that question, consider transgenderism. “Live and let live” flies out the window the moment a man identifying as a woman shows up in the ladies’ bathroom and makes the women in the room uncomfortable. Likewise, how do you solve the problem when public schools demand that teachers use students’ preferred pronouns and some teachers object?

Progressives promise to clean up this mess by carrying their beliefs to their logical conclusion. Transgenderism, they argue, is a perfectly valid identity the state should celebrate and defend. And because it harms people to have their identity rejected, the state must therefore compel others to acknowledge it — thus, force institutions to have transgender bathroom policies. Force taxpayers to subsidize transgender surgery. Fire teachers for refusing to use students’ preferred pronouns. Follow Canada’s example and remove children from their parents if they refuse to embrace their kid’s trans identity.

Conservatives, however, have shown little willingness to follow their own principles likewise to their logical actions. By and large, we assert that transgenderism is, at best, a phase and, at worst, a form of mental illness, so it should follow that the way to clean up the mess is to use the state’s power to hinder those who would do physical and psychological harm to those struggling with a false sense of identity. Yet we are largely unwilling to urge the state to do this.

We aren’t willing to say that mothers who shove their supposedly gender-nonconforming children in front of TV cameras should have their children removed from their homes. We aren’t using the power we have in red states to pass laws promising revoked medical licenses and perhaps even jail time for doctors who prescribe puberty-blocking drugs to minors and chop off perfectly functional sex organs. When trans students show up at schools and demand that teachers use their preferred pronouns, we aren’t willing to say, “The solution to this problem is to forbid males from coming to school dressed as females and vice versa while they get the help they need.”

In all of this, we refuse to clean up the “live and let live” mess by carrying our beliefs to their logical conclusion, which frequently convinces the undecided public that they should probably side with the people who will. That’s why Sen. Elizabeth Warren didn’t consider it political suicide to cheer the bravery of a 9-year-old girl living as a boy. That’s why we’re losing.

Conservatives Need More Than a Supreme Court Ruling

It is, of course, important for conservatives to keep defending those dragged into court for refusing to accept the new LGBT orthodoxy. And God bless those florists, bakers, and educators who have refused to acquiesce to the state’s demands, but not everyone has the mettle or the ability to wait five years for a favorable Supreme Court ruling.

For their sake, it would behoove conservatives to remember that you don’t win culture wars by refusing to fight until you get to the courthouse steps. Likewise, it’s also worth remembering that those who lose culture wars will eventually lose the constitutional protections in which they’ve sought sanctuary.

Sure, O’Rourke’s vindictive tax policy would likely be ruled unconstitutional by today’s Supreme Court. But the more comfortable our culture becomes with the idea of destroying dissenting churches via the power of taxation, the less confident we should be that future justices will maintain today’s understanding of the First Amendment. After all, if the Supreme Court, high on elitist zeitgeist, can stick its hands into the void and invent a constitutional right to abortion or to marry anyone, it can also invent a constitutional right to a clean conscience, which can only be preserved by silencing those repentance-preaching pastors and priests.

Quite simply, conservatives need to win converts to prevent progressives from devouring us. And that won’t happen if we refuse to carry our beliefs to their logical conclusions. So at the risk of rekindling the Ahmari-French debate, when conservatives express discomfort with the concept of obscenity laws, see drag queen story hour as a “blessing of liberty,” and won’t scream in defense of gender-confused children who are being abused by the people who are supposed to protect them, we aren’t clinging to our first principles. Rather, we’re forgetting the very first principle — namely that earthly governments are instituted by God to punish the wicked and reward the good in order to give us a peaceful and quiet life.

Because of this, we shouldn’t hesitate to use the state’s power to defend ourselves and our children from the kind of metastasizing libertinism that rots every brick of the public square it touches. If we don’t, as the journey from Lawrence v. Texas to Beto v. Traditional Christians, Jews, and Muslims shows, those who have gotten comfortable using the state to impose their perverse morality on us won’t tire of doing so any time soon.

6 Crazy School Responses To Parents Mad About LGBT Indoctrination,"Last week I wrote about a suburban Chicago school district’s Oct. 7-11 week of LGBT curriculum as an example of what the state legislature has required all Illinois public schools to teach starting next July. Although the Evanston/Skokie school district is in a very liberal area, not all parents were comfortable with their preschoolers being taught, among other things, that polyamorous families are equivalent to families of sexually faithful married biological parents, and that being gay simply means “loving” someone of your own sex.

According to a local newspaper called the Evanston RoundTable, the district’s administrators and school board heard from several dozen upset parents after their children started coming home and talking about what they were learning about sex in school. These officials responded with a condescending, inaccurate, and embarrassing defense of themselves.

Here are some highlights from the Evanston RoundTable report.

1. Teaching Transgenderism to Preschoolers Is ‘Age-Appropriate’

A Sept. 24 letter from District 65’s two interim superintendents and the head of the local teachers union twice said the district’s LGBT curriculum was “age appropriate.” Emphasis added in the below quotes from the letter:

We are deeply appreciative of District 65 educators and members of the district’s Gender and Sexuality Educators Alliance (GSEA) for the many hours they spent this summer developing robust, thoughtful, and age-appropriate curriculum for use in D65. …All content has been developed to ensure that it is both developmentally and age-appropriate for all students.

At an Oct. 7 board committee meeting, school board President Suni Kartha reiterated: “This really is a wonderful, thoughtful, age-appropriate curriculum.”

In my article last week, I sampled the district’s “age-appropriate curriculum” for children ages 3 to 5. It included numerous LGBT picture books such as the well-known “Heather Has Two Mommies” and “They He She, Easy as ABC” about using trans pronouns.

These preschoolers were told they can be “just like” a transgender teen celebrity named Jazz Jennings, and that transgender means having one sex’s body but a different sex’s brain (which is not backed by one iota of medical science). They were taught “We are all allowed to choose what gender we are.” They were shown this video:

These preschoolers and kindergarteners were taught “Sometimes people use their bodies to help them know their gender, and some people know their gender in their heart.” Also: “If you have two mommies, they can be called LESBIANS. That means that they are two women who love each other.”

This is a common way of explaining LGBT sexuality to young children in the curricula I have reviewed, such as the Queer Kids Stuff channel on YouTube (which District 65’s curriculum also linked to). Yet it’s neither age-appropriate nor accurate. Since preschoolers don’t know what intercourse is (and mostly shouldn’t), they are likely to understand that “loving” means feeling affection, which every normal preschooler does with people of both sexes, and that doesn’t affect their sexuality one bit.

To state what should be obvious, sexual attraction is not the same as love. I don’t know about all of you readers, but I love lots of people whose genitals I never want to touch. Deliberately obscuring crucial realities like this, and by trusted adults to children who have no knowledge of the world to help them know this is a lie, is one reason to call what the district did propaganda.

And the fact that these people think this is “age-appropriate” for preschoolers or, frankly, children of any other age, completely discredits their expertise and authority. They should all resign for egregiously abusing their power. But of course they won’t.

2. Sex Education Isn’t Sex Education

During the school board’s meeting, the district’s assistant superintendent for curriculum, Stacy Beardsley, stated, “There’s nothing in [the district’s LGBT curriculum] that overlaps with sexual education that would require any form of opt out that State law requires.” As I noted in my earlier article, far-left activists have deliberately detached the gender ideology being taught in public schools from sex ed because many states provide extra legal rights to parents for sex ed, such as informed consent and opt-out.

It’s no matter to them that the only difference between a gay person and a straight person is the kind of sex each engages in, and thus any LGBT instruction obviously falls into sex ed. The defining element of being LGBT is one’s preferred sexual behavior, and absolutely nothing else. Thus any LGBT instruction is necessarily sex ed.

This is just a patent attempt to bypass state laws that obviously apply. When Christians do this, with much more legitimacy, by things like trying to have the Bible taught in world religions or world history, the left loses its everloving mind. That’s because their rule is “You follow the laws we make whether you like it or not, and we do whatever we want regardless of what the laws say.”

3. Religion Has Nothing to Say about Sex

“[W]hen people were talking about religious objections, it does become challenging, so we’ve been trying to help people understand that this is not a religious curriculum, this is not a curriculum that is advocating any form of sexuality,” Beardsley said, according to the RoundTable.

Where can people have ever gotten the ridiculous idea that any religions have anything at all to say about sexuality? In the event that Beardsley has only ever heard from culturally assimilated Christians on this, maybe she should make time to talk to, say, a practicing Muslim about whether sexual behaviors have any religious component.

4. Let’s Deliberately Keep Parents in the Dark

The school board also discussed what to do about the fact that parents were keeping their kids home from school during the LGBT week to protect their kids. The Evanston/Skokie school board’s vice president, Anya Tanyavutti, suggested in response, “Not telling people the time of the curriculum is an option.”

Previously the school district’s LGBT curriculum was fully available online, but it has now been made available only to people the district has approved for access.

In the several other states that are passing laws to require all public schools to teach curriculum like this, including California and New Jersey, U.S. Attorney General William Barr noted, this practice of forbidding opt-outs is common.

5. Differences of Opinion Make People ‘Fearful,’ ‘Unsafe’

An unnamed teacher told the school board that she and LGBT people whose emails had been given out to answer public questions had received “horrifying” emails. The RoundTable reported no details from this teacher about what “horrifying” meant, whether there were legitimate threats to these persons’ safety, or whether these emails expressed simply diverse viewpoints.

“Our names are linked to this curriculum, and there is real fear. … We didn’t want to be out this weekend in Evanston because we are truly fearful. I need that to sit with all of you. We are now truly unsafe in this community in which some of us live and all of us teach in,” the teacher claimed.

6. No Opt-Outs Allowed

Upon hearing reports that one school principal had — horrors! — informed parents of when the sexual indoctrination lessons would take place each day so they could take their kids home, school administrators discussed cracking down on this limited exercise of parent choice.

At an Oct. 7 school board meeting, Beardsley “said she had just spent 30 minutes on the phone explaining to a parent why there was no opt out,” the RoundTable reported.

What amount of harmful instruction will and should parents put up with before moving their kids to better schools?

As I reported earlier, the next day school board president “Kartha sent parents and staff a statement: ‘Our administration has heard from a number of parents who want the ability to opt their children out of this curriculum. The District 65 Board of Education does not support allowing students to opt out of this or any curriculum that seeks to include a more complete account of the role of historically marginalized people in our society.’”

The unnamed teacher complained about parents pulling their kids and two school principals allowing children to work puzzles or get picked up by parents during the instruction time. The board and other officials discussed ensuring this could not happen in the future.

“If the family says that they are refusing to have their child be part of the learning, we are not providing that safe space in the building and providing any form of alternate education,” Beardsley said. “…I stand by the fact that all kids should be part of the learning.”

The unnamed teacher asked, according to the RoundTable, “Can people opt-out of Black Lives Matter or the science curriculum that doesn’t meet the religious belief of a family?” Note that the teacher equated political propaganda with actual science instruction. Are the two comparable in this school district? Affirming anti-science positions like the gender unicorn certainly ought to make parents and taxpayers wonder about a school’s science and humanities instruction.

These district employees do, however, have an underlying point. If parents can opt out of one thing, why not another? How far does that extend, and why? What amount of harmful instruction will and should parents put up with before moving their kids to better schools? Do parents really think the kids who skip one week of school aren’t hearing about it from their peers once they go back? In fact, the district’s curriculum explicitly instructed teachers to include LGBT materials in other classes throughout the year, such as reading. The state has mandated that all schools start teaching it in history in 2020.

How can parents trust anything from any school that fails so horrifically on something so basic? Should taxpayers have to fund leftist propaganda that harms children? When are we going to get our kids and money back? By then will it be too late?",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/18/6-crazy-school-district-responses-to-parents-mad-about-lgbt-indoctrination-of-preschoolers/,2019-10-18
"LGBT Students Harassing Christians Isn't Activism, It's Bullying","What is the difference between being an advocate and being a bully? In modern political activism, the line continues to blur as so many on the left refuse to separate one from the other. At Baylor University, a private Baptist college located in Waco, Texas, this distinction and lack of respect for it from liberal activists has been well demonstrated.

LGBTQ Nation reported, “Queer and conservative students are clashing at a religious Texas university.” It describes the “clashing” as, “The LGBTQ students, united under the Greek letters Gamma Alpha Upsilon (GAY), say that YAF [Young America’s Foundation] has made baseless accusations that GAY ‘is violent and [has] intentionally threatened or sabotaged their members/meetings’ by tearing down YAF event fliers and disrupting meetings.”

It’s Not a Clash When One Side Isn’t Fighting

The LGBT organization argues that while LGBT student members do, in fact, routinely tear down fliers and signs for upcoming conservative events and are known for “voicing displeasure over YAF’s conservative speakers,” the students are not acting with authorization from the organization itself. Despite the ongoing dispute over these accusations, members of the organization have so aggressively petitioned school officials to ban well-known conservative speakers such as Matt Walsh and Ben Shapiro, the school is attempting negotiation meetings in an effort to quell the controversy. An “equity officer,” charged with investigating claims of discrimination and harassment, was even involved regarding Shapiro’s upcoming November speech, although a representative of the LGBT group denied requesting officer involvement.

Prior to Walsh’s speech, LGBT students organized petitions “denouncing it that garnered thousands of signatures, as well as an attempt to have the event cancelled, claiming Walsh’s presence on campus threatened the physical and emotional well being of students and faculty.” The school’s multicultural department organized a counter “love feast” event to deter planned protests. One student tweeted, “Letter organizers have gotten some q’s about what Baylor folks should do Tuesday night. Our advice? Don’t give YAF & their speaker the attention they crave. Instead, attend Dia Love Feast, an alternative event celebrating the diversity that makes Baylor great.”

In September, LGBT organization Vice President Anna Conner stated, “Our club does not disagree with Ben Shapiro coming to campus, nor did we disagree with Matt Walsh last semester.” Conner admitted that one member did tear down fliers promoting the Walsh event, but said the member was acting in a personal capacity, not on behalf of the organization.

Zachary Miller, the chair of Baylor’s YAF group, told The College Fix, “The university kind of protects them in a way. … They tore down our fliers and did things against the university policy, which we reported them for, and not only did they not receive any disciplinary action, the university is now obviously negotiating with them to negotiate with us.”

Why Is This LGBT Conflict Occurring?

Despite the conflicting narratives and ongoing tensions between the groups, one important question is missing from the discussion: Why is it a conflict in the first place? A protest from a rival school during a football game gives some insight into this question.

In September, the Rice University marching band performed an LGBT pride demonstration on the field. The demonstration included dozens of LGBT and gender identity flags and LGBT-themed songs. Protesting the Baptist university’s denial of official recognition of the LGBT organization, the spokesperson for the band said, “And so we all got to our show writing meeting Sunday, and we were like, ‘Oh my gosh, this is like exactly what our show needs to be about. We absolutely need to call Baylor out for this.’ From there, it just kind of happened.”

The university has openly stated it is inclusive and open and cares about its LGBT students. The reasoning behind the official denial of the LGBT group follows the school’s religious purpose, as it has stated, “[It is] expected that Baylor students will not participate in advocacy groups which promote understandings of sexuality that are contrary to biblical teaching,” including “heterosexual sex outside of marriage and homosexual behavior.” Beyond this premise, the university has gone out of its way to protect and advocate for LGBT students, demonstrated by ongoing “negotiations” between the LGBT group and YAF, as well as the university providing the LGBT group a meeting room.

The school is both private and Christian, specifically Baptist, which holds to traditional biblical teaching. LGBT students are not denied entrance, expelled, treated poorly, given bad grades, nor banned from congregating. They do not need to hide relationships or conceal their sexual or gender identities. All LGBT students who attend the school have chosen to do so with the understanding of the university’s principles and policies. Yet the conflict comes exclusively from LGBT students breaking campus rules about behavior toward other students and staging protest campaigns against speeches completely unrelated to them or their interests.

While the conversation has centered on how the university ideologically views sexuality, the real discussion should be focused on how the LGBT students view their participation in this particular culture and institution. Why is it necessary to force the university to officially recognize an organization that specifically violates core religious and moral foundations of the school? Why is it necessary for LGBT students to tear down fliers and hysterically claim fear and personal injury at the very existence of a campus speech they assume will offend them? Why does LGBT advocacy require imposing views on every other student at the university?

This LGBT ‘Clash’ Is Simply Bullying

There is no “clash” between conservative students and LGBT students, as there is no conservative effort to silence or ban LGBT student activities on campus. The issue comes solely from leftist students who feel entitled to deny other students the opportunity to hear points of view they have deemed unacceptable. More to the point, out of the thousands of heavily leftist universities across the country, why is it so important for the left to make these demands at conservative Christian schools?

Advocating for a point of view can be a very positive experience for everyone involved. In this scenario, a group of LGBT students gathering together to provide a space for other LGBT Christian students to discuss common issues would be welcome. The students could hold their own discussions and invite their own speakers, even without being officially recognized by the university, and they would find nothing but tolerance.

The bullying comes in trying to force an ideologically driven institution to violate its values to satisfy one faction’s desire for validation and public approval. Whether as an organized force or individually, the fact that the LGBT students are intolerant of conservatives engaging in separate activities is evidence of their motivations.

Leftist activism has taught multiple generations of students that equality requires the total elimination of disagreement and the complete erasure of dissenting views. There is no reason both groups could not function independently without conflict, but leftism requires advocates to shout down and banish thought that threatens its worldview.

Most importantly, it is becoming more and more impossible for Christian organizations to simply exist free from the constant harassment of leftist groups demanding concessions of morality and principles. There is absolutely no reason a private Christian university cannot advocate for its culture of values and morality without facing endless conflict. The only purpose in LGBT students behaving as they are is bullying.

LGBT Activists Get Church Banned From Arts For Believing The Bible,"COLUMBIA, Mo. – Left-wing cancel culture is going after churches, even here in the mid-Missouri heartland. Recently, the pastor of The Crossing, a large local evangelical church, delivered a sermon explaining Christian views on sexuality and gender — specifically, that men cannot become women and women cannot become men. Outrage ensued, which meant something had to be canceled.

As part of its community engagement, this church had been involved with the local arts scene, sponsoring an art gallery and a documentary film festival. Those sponsorships have now been canceled by the recipients. The University of Missouri’s theater department also tried to get in on the action, until lawyers reminded them that government entities are not allowed to issue ultimatums demanding that private groups disassociate from nonconformist churches.

Activists at Mizzou doing something stupid and illegal was to be expected, especially with First Amendment issues at stake. However, I am disappointed that Ragtag Cinema, a small local theater where I have seen a few films (“The Death of Stalin” was a particular favorite), decided that Christians are too icky to do business with. I do not actively screen businesses for disagreement with me, but if one declares that Christians are moral lepers whose patronage must be shunned, I will take the hint, even if my congregation is not targeted.

Transgender Ideology Exemplifies a Huge Cultural Conflict

These businesses have the right to associate with whomever they please and to decline sponsorships if they wish, although many urging them to sever ties with Christians also want the government to force Christians to participate in promoting and celebrating same-sex weddings. But that is just ordinary hypocrisy. What is more fascinating is how this unhappy local story illustrates a general cultural problem that is particularly obvious with regard to transgender ideology — to wit, how to adjudicate competing claims of morality and identity without any shared authority or method of reasoning.

Transgender ideology exemplifies this problem by insisting that an interior, subjective sense of “gender identity” is what truly makes one a man or a woman. According to this view, a man may not only want to be a woman, but may in some metaphysical sense be a woman. This claim is subjective, unverifiable, and requires as much faith as any religious teaching, but activists are determined to impose its observance upon everyone.

Thus, moral disagreements over claims of transgender identity appear intractable, which is why, upon learning of a sermon with which they disagreed, local LGBT activists and their allies responded by trying to coerce and shame the pastor and his church, rather than by attempting to demonstrate why he was wrong. These activists sought not to persuade but to purge.

This is in large part because our culture lacks a common philosophy or theology that these activists can appeal to in making their case, and many would explicitly disavow the possibility of any such standard of truth or goodness. But this acceptance of moral relativism does not make our sense of moral imperatives disappear or seen less urgent. Rather, it has made moral arguments more emotive and irreconcilable.

Differing moral viewpoints seem as arbitrary and irreconcilable as sports fandoms, where we support teams based on locality, ancestral loyalties, or personal whimsy. Thus, when emotional appeals or demonstrations fail, pressure replaces persuasion, and shunning takes the place of reasoning — but on subjects far more important than hoping the Nationals beat the Astros in the World Series.

The radically subjective claims of transgender ideology, combined with the bullying approach its activists often take, offer a clear example of how moral relativism can reduce tolerance and encourage rage. Those who believe that it is liberating for a young woman who is uncomfortable with her body to amputate her breasts and inject herself with testosterone are all the angrier because they do not believe there is a common rationality by which they could persuade those of us who view such “treatments” as mutilating, rather than healing.

Relativism Pervades All of Culture

Although this issue is particularly illustrative, the phenomenon extends throughout our culture. Without a common ground of reason or revelation, moral discourse becomes a matter of emotive performance and intimidation. This is why, in practice, the sort of ironic liberal relativism promoted by Richard Rorty and similar philosophers has produced people who deny the possibility of real moral truth but nonetheless indulge in, and even seek out, perpetual moral outrage.

Intellectually denying the existence of moral truth outside of human creation does not eliminate our moral sensibilities. We will still feel angry at perceived injustice, but relativism reduces the attempt to demonstrate the wrongness of injustice to an expression of subjective sentiment. Power relations may be analyzed and social norms deconstructed and declared oppressive, but these efforts cannot, either in theory or practice, establish justice.

This dismaying situation is the source of much of our cultural crisis. Not only do we disagree about what is good, true, and beautiful, we disagree about how we might come to agreement, with many insisting that nothing is really good, true, or beautiful — our views on goodness, truth, and beauty being only the products of cultural conditioning and personal idiosyncrasies. Conflicting claims of morality and identity therefore appear irreconcilable.

Christianity Provides True Identity Through Christ

Thus, it is not so much that people are challenging Christian moral and theological beliefs to disprove them, but people who do not believe that anything can be proved about what is right or wrong are rejecting those moral and theological beliefs. Morality is understood as a product of happenstance, preference, and power, not truth. And moral relativism, the belief that moral proclamations are arbitrary, intensifies the struggle, rather than soothing it.

Here Christianity offers hope. Its moral teachings are not rooted in the idiosyncrasies of personal desire, yet neither are they an absolute system or methodology, as dreamed of by Enlightenment rationalists who sought to make moral reasoning as precise and provable as mathematics and geometry. Christian moral philosophy includes a great and glorious tradition, but the heart of Christian moral teaching is a person, not a set of philosophical propositions. The moral truths of Christianity arise from divine love for us and the divine will for our good, which are embodied in the incarnation of Jesus Christ.

Christianity provides an identity based on the divine person of Christ, rather than the contingencies of life or the self-indulgence of desire. Christian moral teaching is thus personal without being arbitrary. Its moral precepts protect human flourishing. Although often difficult, they give healing and wholeness. Instead of wrath, they offer peace to the soul, which we all need.

LGBT Activists Hound Chick-fil-A’s U.K. Store Into Closing Immediately,"From the moment popular American fried chicken vendor Chick-fil-A opened its inaugural U.K. branch in the city of Reading, gay rights activists were mobbing it with complaints and calls to boycott.

Barely a week after welcoming its first British customers, Reading’s city center mall, The Oracle, announced that it will not renew the company’s lease. “We have decided on this occasion that the right thing to do is to only allow Chick-fil-A to trade with us for the initial six-month pilot period, and not to extend the lease any further,” The Oracle said in a statement, according to the BBC, noting that it seeks to “offer an inclusive space where everyone is welcome.”

The officials at The Oracle clearly brushed over the fact that Chick-fil-A has some of the most generous employment opportunities available in catering, including scholarships and management opportunities, and retains a staff that is world-renowned for going above and beyond in their service. The staff are rated as some of the friendliest and most welcoming in the entire fast food industry.

Indeed, Chick-fil-A would have been good for Reading. But now, suddenly, the chicken-fried dream is over. Why?

Well, the chief instigator of the abrupt termination was a group named Reading Pride, which believes the company’s donations to organizations such as The Fellowship of Christian Athletes and, God forbid, The Salvation Army, indicates unforgivable bigotry. So, canceled they must be. The first batch of specialty waffles had barely been dunked into the fryer when Reading Pride announced a call to arms in the form of a boycott.

“We respect everyone’s freedom to eat where they choose,” they qualified, “however, we ask the LGBT+ community (including its allies) to boycott the chain in Reading.”

But the Chick-fil-A haters didn’t stop there. In a quite bizarre statement, an affiliated LGBT group even suggested that the British government should investigate the chain before allowing it to open any UK-based restaurants. “Parliament should be questioning businesses like this that work against the values of our amazing country,” UK Pride Organisers’ Network member Stephen Ireland said, according to Christian Institute.

How Chick-fil-A was “allowed to hit the UK high street without openly answering the concerns of the LGBT community” was unfathomable to them, they added.

True to its Christian ethos, Chick-fil-A, the third-largest fast-food business in the USA, responded graciously to the bad press. “We hope our guests in the U.K. will see that Chick-fil-A is a restaurant company focused on serving great food and hospitality, and does not have a social or political agenda,” a spokesman said prior to the lease being terminated. “We are represented by more than 145,000 people from different backgrounds and beliefs, and we welcome everyone.”

Not to be cowed by those who mightn’t agree with every single charitable financial decision they take, the restaurant started filling up, and the customers looked delighted. Still, more clarification was needed. Chick-fil-A doubled down on its commitment to diversity and equality in the causes it supports.

“Our giving has always focused on youth and education. We have never donated with the purpose of supporting a social or political agenda,” the company stated. “There are 145,000 people – black, white; gay, straight; Christian, non-Christian – who represent Chick-fil-A.”

But it was all too late, and the writing was on the wall. For the simple sin of giving away millions of dollars to worthy causes, the popular eatery has fallen victim to the mob of intolerance and will be forced to shutter its doors to a British people who, sadly, hardly got the chance to taste and see that it was good.

Elizabeth Warren Wants To Trans Public Schools Harder Than Obama Did,"Last week Democrat presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren released an education plan chock-full of the worst ideas under public discussion. She would squash school choice, reinforce unions, make decisions such as school location and hiring based on people’s race, double down on failed programs proven to increase violence and facilitate school shootings, and more.

Among this cornucopia of poison fruit is an acceleration of the spread of LGBT policies within public schools nationwide. In her plan, the erstwhile Democratic frontrunner says she would exceed the legally unauthorized steps President Obama took to force the nation’s public schools to allow boys into girl locker rooms, showers, sports teams, overnight accommodations, and more.

I will press to enact the Safe Schools Improvement Act, which requires school districts to adopt codes of conduct that specifically prohibit bullying and harassment on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. I will also direct the Department of Education to reinstate guidance revoked under Trump about transgender students’ rights under Title IX, and make clear that federal civil rights law prohibits anti-LGBTQ+ rules like discriminatory dress codes, prohibiting students from writing or discussing LGBTQ+ topics in class, or punishing students for bringing same-sex partners to school events.

This amounts to legally requiring public schools to give special privileges to students who identify as LGBT. It would have trickle-down effects such as requiring children to be taught about the unproven and medically disastrous theory of gender identity. We know this because these effects are already spreading within public schools, partly due to Obama’s rules (and partly due to the education profession’s extreme leftism and lack of parent choice).

When these ideas become curriculum it includes books like “Heather Has Two Mommies” and “I Am Jazz” for preschoolers. And no public school has ever successfully undone transgender policies once they’ve been implemented. Because the nation’s education system is now top-down controlled by the U.S. Department of Education, public schools are sitting ducks for wild-eyed ideologues gleeful about all the children captive to their social experiments.

These laws and regulations Warren supports demand that all U.S. public schools treat boys and girls as the sex they say they are rather than the sex they actually are. This has led, in a Georgia school district, to a little girl being sexually assaulted in the school bathroom by a boy the trans policy allowed in, and in states like Connecticut to girls losing their shots at athletic awards due to unbeatable competition from biological males.

Besides all this, it is simply destructive, false, and insane to make laws based on the impossibility of a person becoming a sex other than he or she is. Men are men, women are women, and neither can morph into the other. Period. To pretend otherwise is plain insanity. But in our world plain and open insanity is treated as a legitimate political and social position, and promoted by Democratic presidents and top presidential candidates.

President Obama repeatedly fabricated laws out of his own ideology with zero input from Congress — indeed, that Congress never would have passed. One of these was his Department of Education’s 2015 “Dear Colleague” letter that demanded all public schools that take federal funds androgynize private facilities such as bathrooms and locker rooms or face federal investigations, loss of funds, and more.

Even though the Trump administration has technically withdrawn these rules, their existence has been used to start court cases that continue to lock public schools into these policies. Despite this, state Republican leaders such as those in Texas have pretended otherwise to excuse their repeated refusal to pass laws to protect children and affirm reality.

Obama’s regulation pretended that the word “sex” in federal law includes the concept of “gender identity,” an unknown idea at the time the 1972 law against sex discrimination in education was enacted. It took a law that aimed to create legal preferences for biological females and flipped it to create discrimination against those biological females. It rewrote the law with zero input from the branch of government that is supposed to write laws.

That branch has continued to ignore such massive abuses of its prerogatives to ignore our national entitlement disaster, not pass a proper budget in two decades, ignore the South America and border crisis, and keep appearing on TV to shadowbox at the ostensible other political team. In the meantime, legislators are allowing courts to consistently rule that “sex” means “gender identity” so legislators don’t have to pass LGBT preference laws for them to predominate. This also allows so-called lawmakers to throw up their hands and pretend that making law is beyond the control of the very people who are elected solely to make the law.

Payback may be a cosmic b-tch for the feminists who womanhandled Title IX into existence and now see their handiwork being used to give men more opportunities to harass women, but not all females agree equality means we should get special privileges. Nor do we agree that males who want to pretend they are women should be allowed into our private spaces. It’s in fact an outrageous indignity that we should be asked to endure such a thing. The patriarchy is guffawing in its grave.

Warren wants to go further than the Obama administration did and not only define “sex” to include “gender identity” in victim group preference laws, but add additional preferences for the left’s captive LGBT victim class. Republicans, who still control the majority of legislative and executive branches in this country, can’t pass laws to protect vulnerable women from mentally unwell men in our bathrooms, delivery rooms, and shelters, or minor children from having their breasts and penises cut off, but Democrats have no such difficulty in delivering for their voting blocs, even an extremely small one like LGBT Americans. They deliver even when they don’t have the votes to do so, as Obama and our courts amply demonstrate.

Does anyone really think the next Democrat administration, no matter who helms it, will be any less restrained than Obama was with its use of federal agencies like USDOE? If you do, I’ve got a story to sell you about how men can magically transform into women if they just take the right elixir. If you don’t, what are you doing to make sure it’s impossible for the next Democratic president to do what Warren promises?

So far, the answer from Republicans is: a whole lot of jack nothing.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/28/elizabeth-warren-wants-to-trans-public-schools-harder-than-obama-did/,2019-10-28
LGBT Activists Won't Admit Anything's Wrong With Man Flashing Children,"There is little room for polite interpretation when the headline reads “Drag Queen Flashes Crotch to Children During ‘Story Hour’ Event,” as RedState reported on Oct. 29. Rather than hyperbole or an overreaction, the headline describes the event very literally. On Oct. 18, 2019, an organization called Child Protection League Action posted a disturbing photo taken at a Minnesota public library featuring a drag queen sitting in a chair with his legs spread open, revealing his crotch to the children sitting in front of him.

The photo was taken mid-movement, with the presenter clearly in the middle of a performance, and looks accidental. It is unclear if nudity is involved, but the image perfectly demonstrates the concern of conservatives and parents everywhere. Adult entertainment is not suitable for children.

The drag queen, a young man who goes under the name “Sasha Sota,” performs at gay night clubs and posts videos of his performances. He is not a comedian like legendary drag queen Bianca Del Rio. He does not perform as a character like the hilarious and iconic Trixie Mattel. He is a provocative adult entertainer, and as so many on the right have been screaming from the rooftops for years now, such entertainment is simply not for kids. Those that promote drag queens reading to small children nationwide seem intent on refusing to recognize this fact.

People Have Real Concerns About Drag Queen Story Hour

Drag Queen Story Hour, as it is known internationally, is intended to be an advocacy movement to normalize LGBT culture and open gender creativity for children. The idea behind it, as told by a drag queen named Tree Empress 45 Onalicious Mercury, is that “You can be anything you want, I’m a drag queen.” He continued saying, “We’re the embodiment of fantasy and fairy tales. … Why not be for kids?” The curator for the San Diego History Center, which also features drag queen children’s events, argued, “Kids respond to its color and its charm and its funniness, and they are entertained.”

But the reality is that behind the positive ideals and open and inclusive messaging, the loosely organized events nationwide have caused some genuinely serious concerns for parents. On June 25, for example, a drag queen performed a song containing profanity and took off layers of clothing while dancing provocatively at a children’s event. At another children’s event, adults passed out condoms, sexual items, and phallic-shaped bookmarks with sexual education material. While performing at a Portland, Oregon event, one drag queen was photographed lying on the floor with several children piled on top of him.

More disturbing, multiple sex offenders — such as Alberto Garza, who performed in March of this year under the name Tatiana Mala Nina — have been reported at these events. There is no system in place to vet drag performers or standards to determine who should be allowed to participate. The program is supposed to encourage LGBT people to volunteer their time and talents to entertain children. But the refusal to address any controversy whatsoever is significantly undermining whatever good intentions are behind these events.

LGBT websites such as LGBTQ Nation have responded to these concerns with headlines such as “Hate group targets American Library Association over Drag Queen Story Hour.” Media Matters mocked conservative protests with the headline “Right-wing and evangelical media are freaking out over Drag Queen Story Hour in Washington.”

The writer insists, “Anti-LGBTQ figures have regularly fearmongered and spread lies about Drag Queen Story Hour, a national program in which drag queens read children’s books to kids at libraries, schools, and bookstores.” By responding with knee-jerk reactions chanting “hate” and “anti-LGBT,” advocates of the program miss the point of the argument. Many people involved want the best for the children, but only those on the right are willing to act on those concerns.

LGBT Activists Are Taking Things Too Far

A frustrating side-effect of leftist activism is a tendency to go overboard with idealistic initiatives. Rather than attempt to self-regulate these performances and set guidelines for organizations, performers, and parents, they take the opposite approach of a free-for-all. To set limits on the performances would be to acknowledge that conservatives are correct about the adult nature of the majority of LGBT culture and would therefore undermine their primary goal.

More honestly, many LGBT advocates simply do not respect parental concerns and see nothing wrong with presenting explicit sexual content to children, as evidenced by the distribution of condoms and sex guides. They prefer to mock conservatives instead of protecting the program they believe is so positive for children.

This is why the most recent controversy is so telling. The left and LGBT media have simply ignored it as of this writing, and it would be surprising to see any condemnation from them. They simply refuse to recognize the bad that overshadows whatever good they believe they are doing.

A second drag queen named Gemini Valentine also performed alongside Sasha Sota wearing a skintight bodysuit that could in no way be justified as appropriate for kids. Both performers came unprepared for their responsibilities and instead interpreted their performance as being like any other drag show. The performers did not consider their young audience or that their outfits were inappropriate. They did not think to protect the children watching them, accidental exposure or otherwise. And no one who advocates for them does either.

Keep Children Out of Your Progressive Stunts

Drag Queen Story Hour proponents must recognize they cannot allow just anyone to perform at these events, and content and behavior matter. A responsible approach would be to draft volunteers, perform background checks, vet drag styles and adult content, and then provide organizations and parents with details of who the performer is and what his show entails prior to events. From many interviews and reports, it appears many parents enjoy these events and want their kids to participate. They should know in advance their child is not going to be mere feet away from a sex offender or a person who did not think to cover his private parts when sitting down in a dress.

I do not believe drag queens are suitable entertainment for children, even though I understand and admire the positive intentions behind many of the performers who volunteer. There is a valid argument that these performances are no different than clowns or people dressed as characters reading stories to children. But until the movement can recognize it is not self-validating and immune from criticism or standards, Drag Queen Story Hour should not be permitted in publicly funded arenas.

LGBT activism insists on presenting the absolute extremes of the culture in a vindictive and spiteful display to provoke the right, and these activists seem to lack the awareness to understand the damage they are doing to themselves. While smugly mocking average Americans for disapproving of their avant-garde approach to entertainment and art, they undermine the efforts of the LGBT movement in all other areas.

They seem to love nothing more than involving children in these cultural stunts. The LGBT movement is no longer a bunch of wild and rebellious college students trying to shock their parents. We are adults now, and it’s time we take responsibility for our actions and ideas.

Data Says The Violence 'Epidemic' Against Transgender People Is A Myth,"“Trans people are dying!” chanted a group of transgender protesters interrupting Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg during one of many CNN discussions on LGBT issues. Beto O’Rouke and Don Lemon were greeted by a passionate trans activist named Blossom Brown, who shouted, “Black trans woman are being killed in this country, and you have erased trans women for the last time.”

Kamala Harris responded compassionately to an audience member who interrupted her forum by shouting, “How do we get those men to stop killing us? How do we get those men to stop killing trans women of color? We are hunted. Systematically hunted. How can they do that?”

In response to these accusations, Buttigieg calmly assured the audience, “I would like to believe everyone here is committed to ending that epidemic.” Harris responded to the question of how she would address violence against transgender people by saying, “There has to be serious consequence and accountability when it happens.”

Sen. Cory Booker took the issue a step further when addressing more widespread accusations of anti-LGBT violence, referring to it as a national emergency and saying, “We live in a country where we still see regular, everyday violence and intimidation and bullying against Americans because of who they are.” He proposed an “Office of Hate Crimes and White Supremacy” to handle the issue.

The media alarm bells have been resonating on this topic for quite a while, and as each year passes, the ritual listing of transgender murder victims has become a staple of LGBT reporting. In fact, it is impossible to find any article detailing a particular murder without a paragraph or two devoted to discussing the “epidemic” of violence against transgender males dressing as females, specifically of color. It is clearly embedded in our collective consciousness despite the right’s efforts to shed light onto the issue with far more accurate and rational reporting.

Does the Data Show an ‘Epidemic’ of Hate?

I have spent much writing discussing how these stories are exploited and manipulated to create an impression of violence and hatred that rarely reflects reality. As such, I have become familiar with nearly all of the cases so often repeated, but I realized it was time to collect them together and analyze them as a whole.

The Human Rights Campaign has organized this information in packets starting in 2015 through the present. Using these resources, I independently researched each case to the best of my ability with the available information. The HRC reports can be found here: 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019.

In the HRC’s 2019 ongoing information page, the organization made this important statement:

Some of these cases involve clear anti-transgender bias. In others, the victim’s transgender status may have put them at risk in other ways, such as forcing them into unemployment, poverty, homelessness and/or survival sex work.

After years of simply declaring “hate” to be the core motivation, this comes as a refreshing admission of the realities surrounding these murders. However, the LGBT left’s bias toward victimhood still pushes them to place blame where no feasible solution could be found to resolve it.

Table 1: Known Murderers from 2015 to 2019

Of the 118 listed cases from 2015 to 2019, 52 have known murderers. The above chart reveals that the racial identity of the victim and the murderer seem entirely irrelevant to the murder motivation.

While 67 percent of the victims are indeed black, and the majority are trans women, as reported, the majority of their killers are black as well. This is true for white victims and a single Native American victim who was murdered by a Native American killer. In the 2016 case of Brandi Bledsoe, the murderers were both black and white and were also trans women.

Causes of Death Among Transgender Victims

Table 2: Cause of Death

The two largest known categories of murders occur as a result of domestic violence and prostitution. Domestic violence is a known concern in the LGBT community, with a Williams Institute 2015 study finding 25 percent of gay men and 40 percent of lesbian women reporting intimate partner violence.

In prostitution, or “survival sex,” at least 80 percent of sex workers report violence. In my study, I included all personal relationships reported by the press surrounding known cases. Domestic violence does not always target the trans partner, as in the 2017 case of Kashmire Nazier Redd, who physically assaulted Redd’s girlfriend, who defended herself with deadly force and was found not guilty of the crime.

Personal disputes resulting in violence often involve drugs, as the 2017 killing of Stephanie Montez demonstrates, wherein the victim sold drugs to a friend who murdered Montez over a $20 dispute. Gang involvement is another violent motivator, as in the 2015 cases of Mercedes Williamson and Elisha Walker, both murdered by their boyfriends after threats from the Latin Kings caused them to fear for their safety. In 2019, Claire Legato was murdered while intervening in a violent dispute between Legato’s mother and John Booth, a friend, over a tax refund check.

Unfortunately, nearly 30 percent of cases have no information, suspects, or motives to determine a cause of death. The HRC reconciles this information, stating, “While the details of these cases differ, it is clear that fatal violence disproportionately affects transgender women of color, and that the intersections of racism, sexism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia and unchecked access to guns conspire to deprive them of employment, housing, healthcare and other necessities, barriers that make them vulnerable.” But there is no clear understanding of what could be done to prevent these proposed underlying causes when the violence is significantly personal or environment-based.

What Really Happened in These Transgender Murders?

Several included cases make no sense with regard to the purpose of the awareness campaign. For example, five cases involved the police responding to violent scenarios in which the transgender person, mostly trans men (meaning women who identify as men), attacked police officers.

A trans man named Jordan Cofer was one of 20 victims in a 2019 mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio. Nikki Enriquez was murdered in 2018 by Juan David Ortiz, a Border Patrol supervisor and serial killer who targeted sex workers. In the 2016 case of Demarkis Stansberry, a trans man, Stansberry’s friend accidentally shot Stansberry on New Year’s Eve.

After reviewing the 118 cases with all available information, four appear to have been directly anti-trans-motivated. In 2016, Kedarie Johnson, a gender-fluid 16-year-old from Des Moines, Iowa, was picked up by two men, Jaron Purham and Jorge Sanders-Galvez. He was dressed as a woman, and the two men intended to have sex with him. They murdered him once they discovered he was male. Both received life in prison.

Also in 2016, Dee Whigham, a 25-year-old transgender woman from Hattiesburg, Mississippi, met Dwanya Hickerson, 21, with whom Whigham had an online relationship. Once Hickerson discovered Whigham was transgender, he stabbed Whigham 119 times. Hickerson has been sentenced to 40 years in prison.

An attempted serial killer named Denzell Thomas, 24, targeted trans women in Birmingham, Alabama, and murdered Jazz Alford, a 30-year-old trans woman. He also shot another trans woman who survived. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison.

In 2019, Devon Robinson, 18, in Detroit, Michigan, shot five people at a house party, including two gay men and one trans woman, Paris Cameron, 20. In his trial, he stated he shot multiple people while attempting to target LGBT individuals.

We Need Honesty About Crimes Against Trans People

Although LGBT advocates and media insist these cases do not represent a true picture of violence, as often the victim is identified as a different sex by the police until family or friends correct reports, we still have no evidence of a pattern or “epidemic” of violence. It is certainly false that trans women are being “systematically hunted” or that black trans women are specifically targeted.

What we do know from all available resources is that the violence these individuals experience occurs to a very broad range of people with diverse backgrounds and identities. It is clearly more an issue of high-risk environments than identity-based discrimination.

Another important element to recognize is that regardless of gender identity, local, state, and federal authorities take each case very seriously, and more than half of reported crimes have resolved in sentencing. No one is looking the other way or tolerating this violence, and certainly not because the victims are transgender.

The truth is there is very little our government or society could do to reduce these incidents. They result from cultural influences, dangerous environments, and high-risk engagements. The most powerful effects the left, LGBT advocacy and media, and Democratic leaders could have in protecting transgender people would be to tell the truth about prostitution, drugs, risky sex practices, and domestic violence. Continuing the narrative of fighting hatred and bigotry will do nothing more than win popularity points; it won’t save lives.

Why The Left Loves Ta-Nehisi Coates,"Ta-Nehisi Coates’ new novel, “The Water Dancer,” has topped The New York Times bestseller list. I can’t remember ever seeing so much fanfare for a literary novel, particularly a debut one. Coates has been on all the talk shows, including a special edition of Oprah Winfrey’s Book Club. Now, that’s access.

Of course, Coates had to pay his dues first as a journalist. He started off in 1998 writing occasional articles for the Washington Post on hip-hop. In 2008, Coates began writing for The Atlantic, and rode the black Bourgeois Obama wave to professional stardom.

Coates’ success has been a hot topic among black intellectuals. Coates has expressed shock that white people are so interested in his work, since this was not his intent. But regardless of intent, affluent white liberals have become Coates’ most important audience and fan base. White liberals turn to Coates when they want to understand “the black experience.”

Coates’ rise to fame has many factors. His most famous article and first cover story for The Atlantic, “The Case for Reparations,” is a perfect example of making the most of opportunities presented. Coates is an eloquent and experienced writer, with a strong and passionate point-of-view. But there is more to this story.

Blacks in the American Two-Party System

The United States has a two-party system. Each party has a political coalition with disparate interest groups to form a majority governing coalition. In his classic, “The Emerging Republican Majority,” Kevin Phillips demonstrates the surprising consistency of these interest group coalitions over centuries, even if the party in which they are seated changes.

After the Civil War, blacks allied themselves politically with the Republican Party, which at that time was the party of the Union, Abraham Lincoln, and the “Eastern Establishment.” In opposition was the Democratic Party. At the heart of this coalition were white Southerners and white ethnic Northerners, particularly Catholics. While there has been fluctuation over time, and interest groups have changed parties, these same political coalitions more or less remain in the 21st century.

In today’s Democratic Party, blacks play a role as “junior partners” to the Eastern Establishment. Their primary duty is to vote for Democrats. In contrast, the Eastern Establishment is responsible for the financing, the “big ideas,” policy-making, foreign and domestic, and for constructing the “intellectual models” on which the Democratic Party’s ideology and policy are based. Within this large domain of responsibilities, a small section is set aside for black intellectuals and politicos to discuss “race matters.”

Many white Americans wonder why black pundits and intellectuals seem to always talk about “racism.” No doubt racial bigotry is real, and perhaps these folks have a bit of a morbid obsession, but it also arises from the role that they are pressed into playing by the Eastern Establishment. Many black intellectuals would like to be involved in creating the “big ideas,” policy objectives, and intellectual models, but there is strong pressure from the Eastern Establishment for black intellectuals to stick to their lane: “race matters.”

Moreover, the manner in which black intellectuals discuss “race matters” must be consistent with the intellectual model that the Eastern Establishment creates. They must not stray from the de facto ideology. This is easily enforced, because the Eastern Establishment has substantial control over the life chances of black intellectuals and pundits. They largely decide who will be funded and promoted, whether they will be published and where, whether they will be celebrated and given awards, and whether they will be on television.

Coates is very much a product of this system, and has thrived in it, to his credit. One can view Coates’ success from different perspectives, but I will spend the remainder of this essay looking at Coates’ work from the point-of-view of the function it serves in “The Great White Culture War.”

Coates at his heart is a “cultural warrior.” He has in part earned his literary status by demonstrating that he is more useful to the Eastern Establishment’s side of the The Great White Culture War than any black intellectual of his generation. In fact, if you look at the black intellectuals being promoted today by the Eastern Establishment, they are generally battle-hardened cultural warriors.

Black Intellectuals’ Role in ‘The Great White Culture War’

Pat Buchanan’s “culture war” speech at the 1992 Republican Convention was divisive, but prophetic. The Cold War with the Soviet Union had come to an end, but a domestic Cold War within the United States, a “cultural war,” was on the rise. Today, that “Great White Culture War” is ripping the American republic apart.

This culture war exists within white America. There is no culture war in black America. There are not violent debates about immigration, abortion, feminism, or LGBTQ rights tearing black America apart. These are peripheral political concerns for the black demos. Yet intellectuals and pundits of color are able to make careers out of fighting on one side or the other of this Great White Culture War as “mercenary soldiers,” or sometimes a more important role.

Black intellectuals and activists serve two basic functions on the left side of the Great White Culture War. One, they are tasked with “exposing” the “logical contradictions,” “moral hypocrisy,” and hidden “violence” and “domination” that underlies traditional Anglo-Protestant culture, thus discrediting it. It’s a task to which they are extremely well-suited.

Second, they are the “keepers of the legacy” of Martin Luther King Jr., the civil rights movement, and the tremendous moral authority that movement carries. Consequently, they can “loan out” the moral authority of the civil rights movement to contemporary left-leaning political movements, which are aiming to gain political legitimacy.

The problem is that these roles that black intellectuals play in the Great White Culture War tend to undermine each other. This is particularly clear with the LGBTQ movement. Let me explain.

From the ‘Protestant Ethic’ to ‘Post-Structuralism’

Both the abolitionist movement of the 19th century and the civil rights movement of the 20th century were rooted in what might be called the “Protestant ethic.” King’s April 1963 “Letter from a Birmingham Jail,” meant as an appeal to white Christian ministers across denominations, gives one a sense of the moral consensus of the day.

Ultimately, these movements were ideologically based in an American version of the Pauline doctrine of human equality: blacks and whites are equal, because they can both become Christians, and thus achieve eternal salvation. It is important to note that political movements for racial equality have only been successful in this country when rooted in some such Christian ideology and theology.

Political movements for racial equality have only been successful in this country when rooted in some such Christian ideology and theology.

The success of the black revolution that MLK led spawned many imitators. Notably, that includes the sexual revolution, which gave rise to two political movements, which are pillars of today’s cultural left: “third wave feminism” and “gay liberation,” today called LGBTQ. These movements sought to imitate the success and draw moral authority from the historical example of the civil rights movement. They adopted its language as much as possible.

But they wholly rejected the ideological basis for MLK’s movement, the Protestant ethic. In fact, these movements saw Christianity as “the enemy,” as one of the central institutions that had caused their historic “oppression.” Consequently, they looked for a new philosophical model, and they found it in Paris, France. It has many names, but we will call it “post-structuralism,” and its most important exponent was the late Michel Foucault.

After World War II, what might be called “structuralism” dominated Parisian intellectual life, a school of thought rooted in the idea that human phenomena can and must be understood with respect to a well-defined and permanent “structure” that underlies human life and society. The most fashionable school of structuralism was Marxism. Alexandre Kojeve and Jean Paul Sartre reigned supreme.

Note that “structuralism” is an attempt to provide a model of human life and society without referencing any fixed concept of “human nature.” In fact, Karl Marx denied the existence of a permanent “human nature,” but instead teaches that what we call “human nature” has in fact been historically constructed by “human work” over time.

Structuralism is an attempt to provide a model of human life and society without referencing any fixed concept of human nature.

Foucault was of a younger generation, and while he initially was a dedicated Maoist, he eventually turned to a new radical intellectual pose in the form of what we are calling “post-structuralism.” He maintained his disdain for French “bourgeois” norms, but instead of advocating for proletarian revolution, his attacks turned to French bourgeois morality and ethics, utilizing a clever critique of French institutions to discredit them.

Influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche and Martin Heidegger, he developed an historical or “archaeological” method, conducting a series of “studies” on a variety of topics: madness, the medical profession, the prison system, the human sciences, and human sexuality.

Like Marx, Foucault teaches that human nature is historically constructed, but he turns the discussion in a different direction. He looks at how “men of science” have historically constructed the “concept of human nature” over time. He sees a “will to power” within the scientific project to impose the concept of a fixed “human nature” on society, historically enforcing its intellectual model through the “violence” and “domination” of society’s powerful institutions.

One of Foucault’s main themes is debunking the notion that modern bourgeois French society has made moral or ethical “progress” in its practices and institutions. For Foucault, we may perceive our institutions and practices to have become more humane over time, but we are in fact simply blind to the hidden “violence” and “domination” within them. We have not made moral or ethical progress. We are just better at hiding the “violence” and “domination” from public view and public consciousness.

What’s Wrong with Foucault

No doubt, Foucault has some interesting ideas. But as Noam Chomsky notes, the problem with Foucault’s work is that he “throws the baby out with the bath water.” Just because there are logical contradictions, moral hypocrisy, and even outright bigotry in institutions does not in itself discredit these institutions, nor their overall doctrine, methods, and mission. It doesn’t take away from the overall benefits they have brought to human society. Internal reforms simply need to be made.

Chomsky gives the example of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Most scientists are men. Some in the scientific profession have acted in bigotry towards women. And power dynamics do play an important role in determining which scientific projects are pursued. But this in no way discredits MIT or other major scientific institutions as pillars of our material progress and prosperity, not to mention our physical health and national defense. It in no way discredits the “scientific method.” Internal reforms simply need to be made.

Just because there are logical contradictions, moral hypocrisy, and even outright bigotry in institutions does not in itself discredit these institutions.

Today’s LGBTQ movement’s critique of American Christianity, which takes its inspiration from Foucault, is similarly bankrupt. While it is undeniable that Christian institutions, doctrine, and methods have historically been wrought with logical contradictions, moral hypocrisy, and outright bigotry, this in no way discredits their important role in the progress of our society. It in no way discredits their important role in the progress of humanity. Internal reforms simply need to be made.

The post-structuralist model is the current fashion of the intellectuals of the American Eastern Establishment today. Consequently, if a black intellectual wants to get ahead, he must adopt it in some fashion, consciously or unconsciously. He must interpret the civil rights and abolitionist movements through a post-structuralist lens, so that their moral authority may be seamlessly leant to other “liberation movements,” like the LGBTQ movement, which uses this model. This is the price of entry to the black intellectual elite.

This is a steep price. The moral authority of both the abolitionist and civil rights movements rests in the American Protestant ethic, and the Pauline doctrine of human equality. To reinterpret these movements and ground them instead in some kind of post-structuralist ideology undermines their moral credibility—especially since this ideology is hostile to the American Protestant ethic.

Here we see the special value of Coates to the left-side of The Great White Culture War. For Coates, Anglo-American civilization is entirely discredited because of African chattel slavery. This is nothing new or original.

But what Coates also contributes is his doctrine that African-American Christianity is also entirely discredited because of its central role in African chattel slavery. This puts his work wholly in line with the cultural left. No other preeminent contemporary black intellectual has so strongly dissociated American Christianity from the successful acquisition of equal rights for black Americans. This is why Coates is a perfect black cultural warrior for the Eastern Establishment.

U.K. Lesbian Threatened Over Campaign To Remove The 'T' From LGBT,"Lawyer Allison Bailey is the latest U.K. woman to be investigated, singled out, and shamed for her view that biological sex is innate and only women can be lesbians. Bailey, a barrister for the firm Garden Court Chambers, was vocally enthusiastic about the launch of the LGB Alliance last month, which dropped the “T” for trans.

Because of this, she is being investigated by her own employer, although her activities with the LGB Alliance are on her own time and not under the auspices of her firm. One might even conclude it is her lesbianism itself that is under fire from her employer, as that is the root of her activism with the LGB Alliance.

WE DID IT! OUR JUST GIVING SITE IS OPEN!! THANK YOU ALL!!! https://t.co/hWJnjuV4rN — Allison Bailey (@BluskyeAllison) October 31, 2019

More and more women are coming up under investigation and charges of transphobia. Leftists are ostracizing and shunning them for their views. This is actually a good thing, because it means women are waking up to this absurdity, wiping the compassionate sleep from their eyes, and taking a stand despite the personal and professional costs.

The fight for broad, mainstream acceptance of trans ideology is finally getting some visible, widespread pushback. Gender-critical feminists and conservatives have been screaming about this for several years. They have been shamed, derided, and belittled. This all for espousing the view that biological sex is innate and immutable, that altering the sex-specific language of womanhood to include men will lead to female erasure, and, most importantly, that “woman” is not a feeling but a word describing an “adult human female.”

Trans Ideology Is Harming Women

At issue between Bailey and her employer is the LGB Alliance, which splintered off from LGBTQIAP+ advocacy group Stonewall U.K. at a Stonewall meeting on Oct. 22. Stonewall has been at odds with lesbians and gender-critical feminists since 2015 when, after consulting with trans advocates for only six months, it decided to endorse transgenderism.

Bailey, along with so many other women who have simply had enough of this nonsense, in which children are being medically poisoned and lesbians shut out of the gay rights movement, will not give those hard-fought protections for women and girls, nor the validity of the lesbian sexual orientation, to men who wish to be included. The factions are formed, and people are taking sides.

This is an historic moment for the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual movement. *LGB Alliance* launched in London tonight, and we mean business. Spread the word, gender extremism is about to meet its match. — Allison Bailey (@BluskyeAllison) October 22, 2019

As reported in The Telegraph U.K.:

Bev Jackson, a co-founder of the Gay Liberation Front, said: ‘LGB people like us have been writing to Stonewall for over a year – trying to set up a dialogue with them. It’s about the fact that they have chosen to prioritise trans people and have almost abandoned their original mission: protecting people who are same-sex attracted. Sadly, we do still need protection. Young lesbians in particular are suffering; experiencing huge social pressure to transition to male if they do not conform to traditional gender stereotypes. Almost 10,000 people have signed our petition – asking for calm, respectful discussion. Stonewall has stonewalled us every time. So it’s time to set up an alternative organisation.

Garden Court Chambers Can’t Handle Differing Views

Her law firm, Garden Court Chambers, reportedly employs “trans people and trans supportive people, including one who literally founded the Trans Equality Legal Initative (TELI). … They have held Transjustice events and consistently came down in support of trans people’s rights. They have argued against the legal system on behalf of trans people’s rights not to be prosecuted for not telling everyone [they’re] trans. They have been instrumental in pushing for legislation that makes it illegal for anyone who holds data about you to be lax with it and out you as trans by accident. They have fought against trans women being held in male prisons while prisons decide what to do with us and whether our paper work is in check. They have spoken in favour of allowing trans women to be legally recognised as mothers instead of fathers.”

It also seems Garden Court Chambers is not comfortable having barristers with differing views, and the firm has bought into the dogma of its caseload. Bailey is clear in her Twitter profile that her views are her own, she is gender critical, and she believes in “biological reality before gender identity.” A law firm cannot practice law objectively if it cannot even fathom how lawyers in its employ could hold alternative views.

On behalf of Garden Court Chambers, a spokesperson said an “investigation is being carried out and has not been concluded. We have made no decision as yet but we will approach it in an entirely fair and even handed way. We will not make any other comment at this stage.”

Bailey and Others Are Standing Firm Against Trans Dogma

There’s a distinct schism in feminism and gay rights between those who acknowledge that transgender ideology reinforces sex-based stereotypes and is pushing for the erasure of protections for women and girls, and those who are so blinded by “compassion,” they believe biological sex is a mutable condition. Bailey joins a growing list of strident, brave, outspoken women who will not be silenced.

The way trans ideology has emerged, coming through the channels of alt lifestyle enthusiasts and civil rights advocates, from arts organizations to women’s groups, is what has made it so insidious. Before society could even grasp the absurd claims being made, the dogma was upon us, fully formed, set to destroy basic logic and biological science.

It trounced all over the reality that men and women are distinct entities, proclaiming that plastic surgery is a prescription for becoming one’s true self and that the existence of trans adults means there are also trans babies. It has altered language to the point of being unrecognizable, redefining lesbianism as same-gender attracted, and reframing the concept of a lesbian who is same-sex attracted as bigoted against trans people.

Bailey does not appear to be a woman who will back down. She notes that she has already experienced “appalling levels of intimidation, fear and coercion that are driving [Stonewall’s] trans self-ID agenda.” With a legal mind, insight into the U.K.’s justice system, and a drive to advocate for the welfare of women and girls, it seems clear that Bailey is up for this fight. Garden Court Chambers had better watch out.

Why Pete Buttigieg Is The Most Destructive Candidate For Christianity,"There’s nothing like seeing #PeteForPresident trending in fourth place nationwide on Twitter to remind you Pete Buttigieg is still very much in this presidential race.

In the crowded field of Democratic contenders for the White House in 2020, Buttigieg is near the top, polling behind only Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders. According to RealClearPolitics’ latest aggregate of polls, in the early primary state of Iowa, Buttigieg trails only Warren, holding 17.5 percent support — and for good reason.

Buttigieg’s resume glows with accolades and qualifications. He is a Harvard University graduate, a military veteran, and a Rhodes scholar, and each time he takes the stage, we are reminded he is a polished, articulate candidate who models presidential decorum. He embodies social progressivism and diversity, even being LGBT, and he speaks a farsighted message of unity and bipartisanship and faith. This multilingual, Midwest mayor of South Bend, Indiana, checks all the boxes, including religion.

And he is without a doubt the most dangerous candidate for Christianity and the gospel.

Pete Preaches a False Gospel of Affirmation

Faith-related comments have become routine for Mayor Pete. It seems each time Buttigieg has a microphone or an audience, he pontificates about the moral high ground he occupies — or at least all the reasons Republicans have lost their claim to it.

For example, during a GLAAD-sponsored LGBT presidential forum in Iowa, Buttigieg was asked how he would respond federally to state versions of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which the host characterized as legislation “allowing individuals to claim broad exemptions from generally applicable laws … often weaponized to discriminate against LGBTQ people, religious minorities, single parents, and more.”

Buttigieg replied:

The thing that is so upsetting is that not only is it abusive toward LGBTQ Americans, but, in my view, it’s abusive toward the idea of faith. Faith is supposed to be about making people whole and making people better off, and when faith is used as an excuse to harm somebody, to me that is an insult to religion itself.

“Are rural and religious communities really going to get behind this idea?” the host asked. “Because, you know, I would want nothing more than to see the churches I grew up in really change.”

“I think it can happen when we ask people to be attuned to the importance of compassion and supporting each other,” Buttigieg said, affirming the notion that churches should fundamentally change core teachings to embrace LGBT activism. “It is amazing how many people can move past those old harms when you appeal to what is best in them … to bring out the best of what’s already somewhere inside of us.”

Never mind that the mayor completely contradicts the Christian doctrine of total human depravity — a foundational tenet of the gospel — to support his secular sexual ethic, but it is imperative to note that Buttigieg’s threat is not primarily due to being immoral versus moral. Comparing Buttigieg with an angry or scandalous politician — or even with the man occupying the White House — makes the mayor radiate what looks like goodness.

Associating Oneself with Christianity Changes Things

His real problem is that he calls good things evil and evil things good, justifying sin with isolated Bible verses and Machiavellian rhetoric. Donald Trump, for all his faults — and he has many, which Christians should never defend — doesn’t claim the name of Christ.

According to Pew Research, in the 2016 campaign, voters saw Trump as the “least religious” candidate. “Donald Trump is not widely viewed as a religious person, even by those in his own party,” Pew reported. Trump doesn’t appeal to scripture to absolve his shame. He simply doesn’t have shame. And while objectively, that isn’t a good thing, it also doesn’t in itself harm the cause of Christ because it doesn’t associate itself with Him.

Buttigieg, on the other hand, appeals to his “Christianity” endlessly, often weaving his distorted hermeneutic into policy conversations. That is where his danger lies.

The candidate has a Bible verse for everything, and that isn’t hyperbolic. He has preached a veritable sermon for every policy agenda of the 2020 Democratic platform: endorsing late-term abortion, raising the minimum wage, demonizing guns, elevating LGBT ideas, radically counteracting climate change, promoting illegal immigration, and, of course, condemning President Trump. None of these are Christian doctrines, though, and some are actually contrary to them.

Buttigieg Redefines Christianity

The mayor has justified each of his policy proposals as righteous on the authority of God’s Word, calling a failure to endorse his policies “sin” and even going so far as to say Republicans aren’t real Christians.

“So-called conservative Christian senators right now in the Senate are blocking a bill to raise the minimum wage, when Scripture says that whoever oppresses the poor taunts their maker,” he said during the July Democratic debate, ignoring the ample evidence revealing that minimum wage laws hurt low-income workers most, and slandering Christians in the process.

During the same debate and later on Twitter, Buttigieg said of immigration and border security, “For a party that associates itself with Christianity to say it is okay to suggest that God would smile on the division of families at the hands of federal agents, that God would condone putting children in cages, has lost all claim to ever use religious language. … The right doesn’t have a moral monopoly on religion.”

A moral monopoly belongs to nobody — except for God, who has a few things to say about divisive manipulators who serve their own interests and, through “good words and fair speeches[,] deceive the hearts of the simple.”

Buttigieg Twists the Meaning of Sin

Ever curious is Buttigieg’s derivation of sin’s definition. Conferring virtue onto progressive policies through “moral monopoly” balderdash is clever, but to what does Mayor Pete anchor his interpretation of sin?

During CNN’s climate change town tall on Sept. 4, Buttigieg said:

Let’s talk in language that is understood across the heartland about faith. If you believe that God is watching as poison is being belched into the air of creation … what do you suppose God thinks of that? I bet he thinks it’s messed up. You don’t have to be religious to see the moral dimensions of this because frankly every religious and non-religious moral tradition tells us that we have some responsibility of stewardship, some responsibility for taking care of what’s around us, not to mention taking care of our neighbor. … At least one way of talking about this is that it’s a kind of sin.

To the intent observer, Buttigieg always shows his hand, and his trump card is calling sin whatever doesn’t fit his preferred policy goals. “My progressive values are connected to my interpretation of my faith” (emphasis mine), he said during an interview on “The View.” As evidenced above by his shaming of “so-called conservative Christians,” not only does Buttigieg claim those who oppose his policies are sinning, he says they can’t even call themselves Christians. That’s a bold claim.

So bold, in fact, the only one who could ever make this claim was Jesus — and he did. And Buttigieg directly contradicts his teachings.

Mayor Pete Repudiates Scripture’s Doctrines About Life

For instance, on a September episode of “The Breakfast Club” podcast, Buttigieg justified abortion up until the moment of birth, saying, “There’s a lot of parts of the Bible that talk about how life begins with breath. And so even that is something that we can interpret differently.”

Buttigieg suggests we determine life when the baby draws its first breath. A 2020 presidential candidate is suggesting babies can be killed up UNTIL a baby draws its first breath. pic.twitter.com/1VSYHyjRsv — Mary Margaret Olohan (@MaryMargOlohan) September 6, 2019

Buttigieg failed to mention the many verses that imply or directly state life begins long before a human draws his or her first breath. In the Old Testament law, God explicitly forbade killing a child for the sins of his father, establishing a principle that would rule out even abortion exceptions for rape and incest. He even says the standard of punishment for a man hitting a pregnant woman that results in the loss of her child is “life for a life,” equating the value of a full-grown man and an unborn child. Biblically, it’s clear life begins before breath: “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you.”

But Buttigieg makes the entire point moot just a moment later, revealing his purposes are not about scripture, but about policy goals, saying, “The most important thing is the person who should be drawing the line is the woman making the decision.” Ah, there it is.

Buttigieg Disregards Biblical Teaching on Sexuality

Or consider the issue of gay marriage. Christians and many conservatives oppose gay marriage and have misgivings about Buttigieg’s same-sex union to his partner Chasten, but the real problem emerges when Buttigieg credits his lifestyle directly to his “creator” and tramples the faith of Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen Pence in the process.

In a March 11 CNN town hall, Buttigieg slammed Pence for the Religious Freedom Restoration Act — which then-Gov. Pence signed into law after it passed the state Senate 40-10, before reversing the law later under gay activist pressure — referring to the RFRA as “a license to discriminate, provided you remembered to mention your religion as an excuse for discriminating.” Again, dismissing traditional Christian teaching as nothing more than an excuse.

But Buttigieg has dragged Pence into the ring over LGBT issues a number of times. “If me being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade,” Buttigieg said at an LGBTQ Victory Fund event, and a handful of other times. “And that’s the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand, that if you’ve got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.”

He later implied on Twitter the second lady was a Pharisee for working at Christian school with a traditional view of marriage, invoking biblical principles about religious legalists at the expense of all Christ’s teaching on marriage, especially the second half of Romans 1 (because despite large swaths of nominal Christians who dismiss a traditional sexual ethic as Old Testament teaching that no longer applies, we actually derive our doctrine on sex as much from the New Testament).

I am a product of Christian education. At no point in that (excellent) education was I taught that gay employees should be fired or gay students expelled. But we did learn a lot about Pharisees… https://t.co/CuaI3qNYas — Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) January 18, 2019

Mayor Pete Doesn’t Get the Gospel

To his error, Buttigieg fundamentally misunderstands the nature of God, the Bible, and humankind. “What I get in the gospel when I’m in church,” he says, is “protecting the stranger and the prisoner and the poor person and that idea of welcome.”

For all his religious soundbites, Buttigieg showed us the full scope of his belief about Christianity on an episode of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” and to hear him articulate it in full is quite sad. Joe Scarborough asked Mayor Pete if he subscribes to the same religious teaching as President Barack Obama, saying, “Obama] said, ‘I have come to know Jesus Christ personally as my Lord and personal Savior.'”

Buttigieg replied:

Yes, but maybe that means different things to different people, because a lot of people feel that they had a kind of ‘Road to Damascus’ personal encounter with God. For me, just personally, I came to the faith more through an appreciation of mystery and a personal humility.

“But is it a feel-good thing though for you?” Scarborough asked. “Or is Jesus Christ your Lord and Savior?” “So, again, that means different things for different people,” Buttigieg responded, before digressing into hackneyed commentary on God’s love.

Unsatisfied, Scarborough doubled down. “What I’m asking you is, do you believe the orthodox view: Jesus, Son of God, died for your sins, was buried, the third day was resurrected, and will come — will sit at the right hand of the Father, and that your salvation depends on your faith in Jesus Christ?”

Buttigieg flew through a “Yes,” before saying, “and what we do, what I do.”

Mayor Pete Doesn’t Understand Conservatives

Unfortunately, Buttigieg upholds his self-made religion as if it were biblical Christianity and then uses it as a litmus test to condemn true Christ-following conservatives. First, he doesn’t understand that the policies the religious right promotes (however imperfectly) are in keeping with Christian values. Minimum wage laws hurt the poor. Charity is charity, but the government’s “charity” (a.k.a. redistribution) is stealing. Abortion kills babies physically and mothers psychologically.

Second, he doesn’t understand that Christians don’t elect presidents to be their eternal savior. We already have one of those. As for Buttigieg, he has turned government into a god, a tyrannical deity that offers no forgiveness. His policies are an idol, and he bows at the feet of the bureaucracy, disguising his elitist pride as looking out for the “least of these.” His leftist utopia is a religion, and its commandments are etched in rhetoric: “You cannot call yourself a Christian if you don’t support my climate change policy.”

Buttigieg may not know it, but the center of the sacred text he so often quotes is not government. It’s Jesus Christ. And nowhere in scripture does holy God deem prestigious people the moral authority to morph his words into hellish policy. To say so is blasphemy. I would sooner see an outright atheist commander in chief than a wolf in sheep’s clothing who disdains true Christianity but claims it as his own, leading others astray all the way.

So forgive me if I don’t tweet #PeteForPresident.

APA Demands Using Plural Pronouns For Nonbinary Individuals,"In what appears to be one of the most remarkable examples of irony in left-wing “progress,” the LGBT left is celebrating the American Psychological Association’s style guide adopting “they/them” as the official pronoun designation for nonbinary people.

LGBTQ Nation tweeted, “With this move, the APA is recognizing the existence of nonbinary people and inviting others to understand them better.” This change follows the highly publicized revelation of British singer Sam Smith changing his personal pronouns to “they” and “them” and stating, “I hope you can see me like I see myself now.” This style guide change represents a moment of truth for the LGBT left in erasing individuality to celebrate absolute personal customization of identity.

They/Them Just Doesn’t Work as a Singular Pronoun

The APA style guide is widely used in academic writing, and the decision to essentially create a new usage from an established pronoun is absurd. The APA blog post, titled “Welcome, Singular ‘They’,” explains that “they” is a generic third-person pronoun identical in usage to “he” and “she” and apparently “ze.”

It elaborates, “[S]ome people use other pronouns, including ‘they,’ ‘zir,’ ‘ze,’ ‘xe,’ ‘hir,’ ‘per,’ ‘ve,’ ‘ey,’ and ‘hen.’” Why is this necessary? The article argues, typically scholarly papers would use “he or she” to avoid introducing bias to the reader. Doing so allows the reader to make assumptions about the sex of the subject that may not be accurate.

The concern now is that this bias may assume the subject identifies as male or female when that may not be the case. The guide states, “APA advocates for the singular ‘they’ because it is inclusive of all people and helps writers avoid making assumptions about gender.”

The irony, of course, is that if “they/them” is meant to designate a nonbinary person, then the use of “they/them” significantly biases the reader about the subject’s sex. If, on the other hand, “they/them” is inclusive of all people, then it is not particularly useful for helping nonbinary people, as LGBTQ Nation and Smith argued, feel seen or better understood.

More specifically, the guideline mandates the pronoun usage, stating, “If you are writing about a person who uses ‘they’ as their pronoun, then yes, you have to use it. Respectful and inclusive language is important.” Again, this creates a standard for readers that if they see the pronoun “they/them,” the subject must be nonbinary.

As illustrated by my use of the pronoun, it designates a hypothetical person with no other individual characteristics. The messaging here seems to be that nonbinary people are both significant and individual enough to require “respectful” recognition while simultaneously being interchangeable with the generic representation of all people.

Generic Identity Removes Individuality

The LGBT organization GLAAD instructs that “nonbinary” or “genderqueer” are “used by some people who experience their gender identity and/or gender expression as falling outside the categories of man and woman. They may define their gender as falling somewhere in between man and woman, or they may define it as wholly different from these terms.”

This was explained in the People magazine article about Smith, which concluded with Smith saying, “Some days I’ve got my manly side and some days I’ve got my womanly side, but it’s when I’m in the middle of that switch that I get really, really depressed and sad. Because I don’t know who I am or where I am or what I’m doing, and I feel very misunderstood by myself.”

Both descriptions involve scenarios in which male and female are established sex standards, and only when a person feels somewhere in between the two, defined exclusively by societal sex stereotypes and norms, are they something else. This designation removes people’s individuality, making their identities dependent on their own fluid perception of how they experience these sex stereotypes on any given day. This does not, in any way, seem empowering or healthy.

This is equally revealed in the addition of an “X” on birth certificates, recognized in 11 states to indicate a nonbinary person. How does reducing identity to a generic “X” on a birth certificate indicate progress toward a more inclusive and respectful society?

I have adopted the term “nonbinary” for myself, as it illustrates what liberal society has been advocating for decades: a freedom from strict sex norms. While the left has moved backward toward fusing male and female into the very essence of a person’s identity, I, and most of the right, advocate for individuality and freedom from such unnecessary limitations.

Strangely, where the LGBT left has associated nonbinary identity with a rejection of physical sex, in reality, it better aligns with the traditional feminist view of equality of the sexes and human autonomy. Gender was not supposed to dictate a person’s fate or determine his or her path in life. As a male person who does not particularly identify with either set of gender norms, this concept is empowering and freeing for me. It seems the LGBT left wishes for me to abandon this sense of autonomy and personhood.

Why Does the LGBT Elite Accept the Generic Pronoun?

Our society allows people to achieve things based solely on their individual desire, ability, and ambition, without limitation imposed on them by their condition of birth or physical characteristics unique to them. People can discover their identity without the boundary of social gender norms restricting their options. The purpose of the sexual revolution was to free people from believing they were trapped in the life they found themselves born into. Why on Earth would academia take this boundless opportunity and reduce all people to a singular “they”?

More importantly, why would LGBT people welcome such a dehumanizing social designation? LGBT culture once boldly celebrated the rejection of sex stereotypes, and referring to a transgender person as “it” has been considered a slur for some time. It is baffling to watch a generation of LGBT people, who often love to distinguish themselves with brightly colored hair, clothing, and tattoos, adopt such a gray, generic term. It is even more frustrating to watch them view their bodies as a form of oppression, restricting them from fully living as their true selves.

The push in academia to normalize “they” as a singular pronoun is concerning. Without the option to verbalize views without adhering to strict official guidelines in scholarly language, dissent will become more and more difficult. Furthermore, belief in generic identity constrains the fight for individuality. I am certainly not a “they,” and I shudder to imagine a society that prefers to see me as a generic and inclusive pronoun, rather than a whole and autonomous person.

Chick-fil-A Caves To Pressure By Halting Donations To Christian Charities,"“Closed on Sundays/ you’re my Chick-fil-A,” sang new Christian convert Kanye West on his highly publicized new album, “Jesus Is King.” But the free publicity from one of the most high-profile Christians in America wasn’t enough to shore up the fast-food brand against the pressures of activist-journalists urging the public to “cancel” Chick-fil-A for not just its leadership’s biblical stance on sexuality and marriage, but the stance of even the charities it donates to.

As business publication Bisnow reported, company leadership “felt a new message was needed — especially in foreign markets, where the most prominent brand exposure to Chick-fil-A are headlines about its support for organizations with anti-LGBT stances.”

The company is thus slashing the number of charities it donates to from 300 to two, plus various food banks, to address three areas of focus: hunger, education, and homelessness. “Future partners could include faith-based and non-faith-based charities, but the company said none of the organizations have anti-LGBT positions,” Bisnow reported.

It is unclear whether faith-based organizations need to explicitly denounce Christianity itself or the traditional view of sexuality in order to receive Chick-fil-A’s donations, it means their work never aggravates LGBT activists, or something else, but the company’s decision to halt donations to the Salvation Army suggests the threshhold for not having “anti-LGBT positions” is high. After all, the Salvation Army runs a shelter for transgender people in Los Angeles.

As Chick-fil-A expands internationally, a company executive told Bisnow that charitable giving to Christian organizations was inhibiting the chain’s growth. In Reading, England, a mall landlord refused to renew a pop-up restaurant lease because the mall is supposed to be “an inclusive space where everyone is welcome.” A flurry of protesters also showed up to demonstrate on the opening day of the restaurant’s first location in Toronto.

Being Out about Christianity Didn’t Hurt Chick-Fil-A

Despite losing the business of an entire day of the week because it’s closed on Sundays, the chicken sandwich franchise is poised to become the third largest fast-food chain in the United States. If the brand has been damaged, sales don’t seem to reflect it. In 2012 it passed $5 billion in revenue, even after its CEO Dan Cathy said he was “guilty as charged” regarding the company’s support of “the biblical definition of the family unit.”

“We want to do anything we possibly can to strengthen families. We are very much committed to that,” Cathy had said.

Despite Chick-fil-A’s lack of any policies that discriminate against sexual minorities, such as refusing to hire or serve them, its reputation for being “anti-LGBT” due to its support for Christianity has also generated severe resistance here in the United States from landlords and city governments. This last March, Chick-fil-A was denied a concessions deal for the San Antonio airport.

San Antonio Councilmember Robert Trevino, who voted against including Chick-fil-A in the deal, said the city was “full of compassion,” and that they “do not have room” in their public facilities “for a business with a legacy of anti-LGBTQ behavior.” Chick-fil-A lost a planned deal for concessions at the Buffalo Niagara International Airport and will be dropped from a lease at San Jose airport in 2026.

Left Defines Hateful as Being Christian

That reputation for being “hateful” and “anti-LGBT” mostly stems from the company’s former charitable giving to organizations that support the traditional family and therapy to assist those with unwanted same-sex desires. The company has previously given to the Family Research Council and the now-disbanded Exodus International, a group that promoted “ex-gay therapy” and whose president apologized for the “trauma” and “stories of shame, sexual misconduct, and false hope” he said people experienced from his organization.

Last year, Chick-fil-A Foundation gave $115,000 to the Salvation Army and $1.65 million to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. FCA policy condemns “sex outside marriage and ‘homosexual acts,’” Bisnow reported. The Salvation Army has been accused of anti-LGBT discrimination, but the organization says it is “committed to serving the LGBTQ community” by providing shelter, job training, nutrition, suicide prevention, and help with substance abuse.

In the past the chicken chain has been clear about its Christian influences. Cathy said in 2012 that the corporation “is based on biblical principles, asking God and pleading with God to give us wisdom on decisions we make about people and the programs and partnerships we have. And He has blessed us.”

“We’re talking about how our performance in the workplace should be the focus of how we build respect, rapport and relationships with others that opens the gateway to interest people in knowing God,” Baptist Press reported Cathy as saying.

This new messaging is expressly meant to overcome the perception of being “anti-LGBT” that has stalled the mega-chain’s growth in some cases. It appears the almighty dollar might be exerting a bit more influence over Chick-fil-A than devotion to the Almighty God, even if that profit potential is being stymied by legislators, journalists, and lobby groups hostile to the Christian position on sexuality and family structure.

Capitulation Only Puts Blood in the Water

It remains to be seen whether restructuring its charitable giving will appease Chick-fil-A’s critics. If past experience is any indication, the pressure will not yield.

The left generates a steady stream of boycotts, bans, and attempts to censor and limit the influence of people whose opinions are grounded in biblical principles. Several years ago, Firefox CEO Brandon Eich was ousted for supporting Proposition 8 in California, which would have prohibited same-sex marriage.

In March, a Michigan policy allowing adoption agencies to cite religious convictions in declining to work with LGBT clients was reversed after a lawsuit. In Colorado, Jack Phillips of Masterpiece Cakeshop has continued to face persecution by activists after the Supreme Court determined his state prosecution for declining to participate in same-sex weddings was rife with anti-religious animus.

More than 100 actors and small production companies vowed to boycott Georgia over its pro-life “heartbeat bill,” and the city of San Francisco “blacklisted” 22 states that limit abortion access by limiting contracting and prohibiting travel by state employees to those states on the company’s dime. The city had already blacklisted nine states for LGBT-related policies. The California Assembly arguably banned sales of the Bible and any literature that doesn’t affirm nonheterosexuality.

Public figures on the right have repeatedly been denied speaking gigs on college campuses because of their views, most famously Ben Shapiro. Even likeable actor Chris Pratt faced a swift backlash on social media when it was revealed his church did not hire homosexuals into leadership. Indeed, how many entertainers and business leaders have we seen cave to pressure and issue the “correct” statement after their social media struggle sessions?

The media’s effort to paint Chick-fil-A as “anti-LGBT” will not stop just because they’ve restructured their charitable giving. If the charities are no longer a focus, then the statements and principles of its leaders will be, even if they don’t affect how the company is run.

The focus will shift back to Cathy and any leadership who align with his beliefs, possibly leading to the ousting of any leadership that have spoken out in favor of the biblical family or associated with people who have done so. It may just be a matter of time before Chick-fil-A ceases to call itself an organization “based on Biblical principles.”

Chick-fil-A Should Learn A Lesson About LGBT From The Salvation Army,"Chick-fil-A stated Monday that starting at the beginning of the year it will no longer donate to The Salvation Army, to which the restaurant franchise gave $115,000 in 2018. This decision came shortly after LGBT groups pressured Chick-fil-A into closing its first location in the United Kingdom.

Chick-fil-A was accused of donating money to, as CNN reported, “anti-LGBTQ” organizations, including The Salvation Army. GLAAD, an LGBT organization, argued LGBT people should “greet today’s announcement with cautious optimism,” while LGBTQ Nation dismissed the change as merely a PR move to make more money. The accusation of The Salvation Army as an “anti-LGBTQ” organization, however, requires a deeper dive.

If you read The Salvation Army’s page dedicated to LGBT concerns, you might imagine it was from any major LGBT advocacy website. The first posted statement concerns housing obstacles for some LGBT people. It states, “Because LGBTQ Americans living in poverty often experience unacceptable homophobia and transphobia, many become homeless.”

Arguing that nearly one-third of transgender people have been rejected from homeless shelters around the country, The Salvation Army provides details about a dorm in Las Vegas it built specifically to help this vulnerable group. Their messaging addresses substance abuse, access to food, job training, and suicide prevention.

Stating that a donation to its cause can provide three nights of shelter, the charity assures the reader, “When a transgender person seeks help from us, we serve them in the same manner as any other person seeking assistance.” It even offers rental and utility assistance, arguing on behalf of LGBT Americans, which it states are more likely to be poor.

This information is not buried deep within the website, either, to be found only through dedicated searching. On its What We Do page, The Salvation Army includes “Serving the LGBTQ Community” right alongside “Love the Elderly” and “Stop Domestic Abuse.” It clearly communicates that the burdens of LGBT people in need are just as urgent and important as everyone else’s.

Pop Culture Clashes with The Salvation Army

Yet British singer Ellie Goulding recently told her fans she would refuse to participate in the Dallas Cowboys versus Buffalo Bills game on Thanksgiving Day, sponsored by The Salvation Army, saying, “[S]upporting an anti-LGBTQ charity is clearly not something I would ever intentionally do.” Goulding previously worked with The Salvation Army and posted on her Instagram the work she had done.

She did so with pride. It was only after fans began inundating her with outrage that she changed her position. One fan lamented, “A little disappointed considering the salvation army has a long standing history of anti lgbtq+ rhetoric. i appreciate the positive things they do but there are other, better organizations that don’t discriminate against others.” Another said, “They only help *certain* people. Very homophobic, transphobic, anti-LGBTQIA+ organization. Please do your research before endorsing a company that continues to hurt our community.”

Goulding gave The Salvation Army an ultimatum. “Upon researching this, I have reached out to The Salvation Army and said that I would have no choice but to pull out unless they very quickly make a solid, committed pledge or donation to the LGBTQ community,” she said.

Jon Rich, a Salvation Army commander in the area serving the upcoming football game, quickly responded: “It brings attention to how inclusive we are as an organization and serving everyone no matter who they are, what their sexual orientation is, what their station in life is. We serve without discrimination.” After reaching out to Goulding and reassuring her of The Salvation Army’s equal treatment of all people, she agreed to do the show.

The Salvation Army Northern Division FAQ page provides insight, addressing concerns related to how it engages with LGBT people. The page firmly states, “Any person who comes through our doors will receive assistance based on their need and our capacity to help.”

The organization investigates and takes action in cases of alleged discrimination. It has spent $300,000 on diverse lobbying efforts in the last two decades, 0.0009 percent of its income. As Rich stated regarding same-sex employees, “Now, nationwide we offer health benefits to same-sex couples, no questions asked.” He continued, “But we think everyone should have access to healthcare. So why wouldn’t we do that?”

LGBT Media Goes After the Salvation Army Regardless

Despite this overwhelming assurance that The Salvation Army in no way endorses or engages in discrimination or hatred toward LGBT people, LGBT media overwhelming include it in lists of “anti-LGBT” organizations. ThinkProgress in 2019 argued, “The Salvation Army has a long record of opposing legal protections for LGBTQ Americans.” The Huffington Post cited the same reasoning, “The Salvation Army, which has an extensive record of anti-LGBTQ advocacy.”

Transgender activist Zinnia Jones published a list of the organization’s anti-LGBTQ history on the Huffington Post back in 2013, and it has been referenced ever since. The list begins in 1986 and covers the organization worldwide, which is active in 130 countries.

The official list includes five examples. In 1986, the New Zealand Salvation Army helped collect signatures to oppose a law that would decriminalize homosexuality and issued an official apology in 2008. In 1998 a branch in San Francisco chose to turn down money from the city that included a requirement to provide benefits to employees with same-sex partners.

In 2000, the Salvation Army of Scotland submitted a letter to Parliament opposing the teaching of homosexuality in public schools. In 2001, the U.S. branch lobbied to protect religious institutions from being held liable under anti-discrimination policies. The Salvation Army addressed this, saying, “[T]he effort was solely focused on allowing our clergy and those involved in our religious activities to work on federally funded social service programs without having to compromise core religious beliefs.”

In 2012, the only stated accusation of discrimination, Danielle Morantez, a case worker for the office in Burlington, Vermont, claimed she was fired after coming out as bisexual. The story’s latest update appeared in 2012 on the GLAAD website. Jones recognized then that The Salvation Army had already set up pro-LGBT pages and removed reportedly offensive information on its site.

Confusion Over Biblical Teaching on Sexuality

Also in 2012, a controversy arose, as the Washington Blade reported, “[A] Salvation Army spokesperson told an interviewer that gay people deserve death, according to scripture.” The Salvation Army addressed this as well, stating, “The officer was responding to a question about a Bible passage which most Christians understand to be a discussion of spiritual death, meaning a separation from God, their creator.” The organization widely condemned the statements shortly after the interview was reported.

Essentially, the issue for LGBT activists, despite the information the organization has provided over the last two decades, is as Jones puts it, “These statements completely ignore the reality that the Salvation Army continues to maintain anti-gay theological stances.”

Time and time again, the biblical belief system of the organization itself comes up as a fundamental argument used to demonstrate the hatred and bigotry the organization represents: “The Salvation Army states clearly they believe, The Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments were given by inspiration of God, and that they only constitute the Divine rule of Christian faith and practice.” For many on the left, this alone is enough to dismiss the organization as hateful.

In 2013 Jones made the plea, “Supporting the Salvation Army this season, whether by tossing your change in their red kettles or donating your used goods to their resale shops, means assisting an aggressively anti-gay church in furthering its goals of discrimination.”

In 2018, LGBT author James Finn wrote, “Did you know that when you give money to the Salvation Army, you’re giving money to a church? Did you know that the Church is viciously homophobic and transphobic, fighting all over the world for the right to discriminate against LGBTQ people?” This reasoning, in part, motivated Noah Michelson to pen his 2018 Huffington Post article titled “If You Really Love LGBTQ People, You Just Can’t Keep Eating Chick-fil-A.”

The Good Guys Shouldn’t Bow to the Outrage Mob

Regardless of the factual information, the context of several decades, scattered accusations firmly condemned by the core organization, and the open welcoming of LGBT people, all that matters for the left is the idea of Christian faith behind it all. As CNN reported, “The Salvation Army has said in the past that the Bible forbids sexual intimacy between members of the same sex, that gay Christians should embrace celibacy and that scripture does not support same-sex marriages.” This on its own seems enough to justify the left’s hatred.

The thing about attempting to appease those who hate you is that whatever you do will only deepen their suspicion of you. As GLAAD’s director of campaigns and rapid response Drew Anderson cautioned, “In addition to refraining from financially supporting anti-LGBTQ organizations, Chick-fil-A still lacks policies to ensure safe workplaces for LGBTQ employees and should unequivocally speak out against the anti-LGBTQ reputation that their brand represents.” It will never be enough when the opposition views you as a threat based on what they think you believe rather than on what you express to the world.

Christians should follow The Salvation Army’s lead and continue to stand for their faith while speaking to the accusations against them and opening their arms as they would anyway. But we cannot underestimate the power of propaganda and simply hope Chick-fil-A realizes the mistake it has made. The Salvation Army argued, “When misinformation is perpetuated without fact, our ability to serve those in need, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, religion or any other factor, is at risk.”

In the left’s crusade against the Christian faith it refuses to understand or tolerate, it harms the people it claims to defend and protect. This means good people must step up to ensure no one in need is left behind in the meantime, and for the record, The Salvation Army is very good people.

"New York Requires Religious Orgs To Hire Pro-Abortion, Pro-LGBT People","New York has taken a strong stand against both religious freedom and life causes this year, with three laws that push forward an ethical climate in the state completely incompatible with liberty, true health care, and allowing people to live according to their consciences. These laws push an intrusive agenda, overreaching into every part of people’s lives, including into whether churches can hire and fire people for doctrinal issues.

Each of these on their own is too far, but together they create a situation in New York that alters the fundamental ability of people to live their lives and worship according to their sincerely held beliefs. New York has violated the most basic and simple protections around people’s rights to free association and free exercise of religion.

New York’s Egregious Law Trifecta

Each of these three laws builds on each other, strengthening the anti-family, anti-freedom, anti-religion position of the state. The first is the Reproductive Health Act (SB 240), which has radically extended abortion access in the state.

Abortion is now legal in New York through 24 weeks of pregnancy — a gestational age at which babies are born and can survive with NICU care — or until birth if the baby is deemed to have an “absence of fetal viability,” or if the mother’s life is somehow threatened. This law also grants New York citizens the fundamental right to sterilization.

It also struck from penal law the homicide protections for unborn children, so when a pregnant woman is victimized in the worst way and deprived of her life, there is no justice for the murder of her baby. It also removes the ability of a coroner to investigate a death by a suspected “criminal abortion.” Since the passage of this law, there has already been at least one attack on a pregnant woman that led to her death as well as her baby’s, wherein the murderer could not be charged with the baby’s death.

Women matter. Their babies matter. Justice for them when the unthinkable happens should be preserved, not legislated away. New York’s lawmakers should remember Jennifer Irigoyen and her unborn child, and the fact that their law lessened the legal ramifications for the man who murdered them.

Chemical Abortion Is Not Contraception

New York’s second law in this trifecta is the Comprehensive Contraception Coverage Act (SB 659A). Health plans in New York must now fully pay for contraception on behalf of employees, including for medications that can end a pregnancy. All Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptives, devices, and procedures must be covered at 100 percent, with no cost-sharing.

Gone with this is the ability for religiously motivated plans to take a stand against medications that can harm or destroy an early-stage pregnancy. The law includes no exclusion or opt-out for religious institutions or those that do not want this coverage. New York has decided all plans in the state must cover it and everyone in the state must have this available, whether they want it or not.

Then there’s the final piece of this picture: SB 660. Supporters of this bill named it the “Boss Bill.” This law ends the ability of churches, schools, hospitals, and all other religious businesses to employ only people who share the same beliefs about sexuality, family planning, or abortion.

The law reads in part: “To prohibit employers from discriminating against employees based on the employees’ or dependent’s reproductive health decisions, and to provide remedies for such violations.” Also provided under this new law are the remedies, including financial restitution, reinstatement of the job if the person is fired, and attorney’s fees.

These Laws Violate Basic Freedom and the Public Will

Denise Harle, legal counsel with Alliance Defending Freedom on this case, explained the implications for New York employers:

This law tells religious organizations and groups that they must employ, hire, and keep employed people whose beliefs and behaviors violate the religious beliefs of the organization. So in other words, it prevents any religious group or organization from — it says discriminating — but for making any hiring decisions based on someone’s reproductive health decisions. So in the example of a church like our client, First Bible Baptist Church, this would prevent them from making sure they’re employing people with beliefs and Biblical teachings on sexuality and marriage and reproduction. In the case of our client CompassCare and NIFLA, the pro-life pregnancy centers, this would actually require them to employ people who promote and endorse abortion, which obviously violates kind of the core mission of those charities.

It’s clear the reality lawmakers are creating in New York: one where the religious are restricted from deciding who they can hire, even on sincerely held beliefs and doctrinal tenets. A place where attacks on pregnant women, leading to the deaths of their wanted and loved unborn children, don’t equal double murder charges. A place where religious groups, such as orders of nuns, are forced to pay for unwanted abortifacients. New York doesn’t value religious diversity. It’s violating it.

New York’s laws and leaders are out of touch with the views of mainstream Americans, as demonstrated in a newly released Religious Freedom Index from the Becket Fund for Religious Freedom. This survey found that Americans treasure religious liberty, even when that liberty is “discriminatory”: “68% strongly support religious freedom, even if it means allowing for ‘offensive/discriminatory’ views.”

Directly contrary to New York’s new law, Americans believe employers alone should be able to determine who they hire and who they fire: “7 in 10 respondents support freedom for religious groups or organizations to make their own employment and leadership decisions without government interference,” and they support the rights of organizations and those who run them to make choices based on faith: “73% of respondents support freedom for people to run their business or private organizations according to their religious belief.”

To all the faithful in New York, to the lawyers bringing the lawsuits challenging these unjust laws, to the judges who will hear these suits, please remember and fight for religious freedom. Fight to preserve life. No one should be forced to acquiesce to laws that go against core parts of their faith, and New York is terribly, terribly wrong to have passed these laws. Support ADF in this legal fight, as all the work they do fighting for liberty and freedom is pro bono.

Be Informed About Your State Legislature and Laws

Harle also believes being informed is a vital part of what people can do to help in these cases:

I think a good thing to do is honestly be educated about this bill and the way it violates the Constitution and to speak out about it, speak to your friends and neighbors. Certainly, I think it’s great to support even sending a note of encouragement or otherwise support these ministries that are already standing up on behalf of so many other groups. You know, it’s not fun to be in litigation, but these people are willing to take a stand and to defend their person and that right — and on behalf of all others in New York that deserve the same freedom.

This isn’t only New York’s problem, and should serve as a stiff wake-up call to Americans across the nation. Be vigilant in watching bills that are proposed and working through your state’s legislature. Contact all your elected officials and let them know how important protecting life and religious liberty are to you and your family.

Places of worship must be able to make their own determinations on who to hire and why. It’s unthinkable to allow the courts to intrude on this, something the Supreme Court agreed with in 2012. Being discerning — being discriminating — in who can fulfill religious obligations in religious workplaces such as churches, schools, care centers, etc. is vital to the way they operate.

Anything else is a fundamental change in how religion functions in America. New York’s new laws are wrong and must be overturned.

Courts Block Conscience Rights In Medicine Based On Absurd Arguments,"Are Christian medical workers lobbying the United States government to allow them to toss pregnant women out of ambulances onto the street if they require an emergency abortion? According to several federal and district judges, this is such a serious concern, it requires blocking religious and conscience protections entirely.

The May Health and Human Services rule, titled “Protecting Statutory Conscience Rights in Health Care,” was originally scheduled to go into effect nationally today, on Nov. 22, but a New York federal judge prevented this in early November, and a U.S. district judge in Washington state issued a similar ruling shortly after.

In the third ruling, issued this week, U.S. District Judge William Alsup of the Northern District of California stated, “Under the new rule, to preview just one example, an ambulance driver would be free, on religious or moral grounds, to eject a patient en route to a hospital upon learning that the patient needed an emergency abortion,” he wrote. “Such harsh treatment would be blessed by the new rule.”

Alsup cited this example from the prior judicial ruling against the rule by Judge Paul Engelmayer of the Southern District of New York, who presented the following scenario during the hearing:

A pregnant woman takes an ambulance across Central Park to Mt. Sinai Hospital and, midway through, from conversation with the ambulance driver, it becomes clear that she is headed there to terminate an ectopic pregnancy. The driver tells her to get out in the middle of the park, and the employer fires the ambulance driver for that. Is the ambulance driver assisting in performance of the procedure if the ambulance driver takes her to the hospital?

The primary concern was over the phrase “assist in the performance of,” related to a procedure or practice the medical worker morally opposes. The HHS confirmed an ambulance worker would be covered under this phrase and stated, “The rule protects an ambulance driver’s ability not to assist in the performance of a procedure to which the driver has an objection.”

Despite pro-lifers opposing elective abortion, not life-saving measures in an ectopic pregnancy that typically end in the accidental death of the baby, both judges interpreted this to mean the HHS affirmed the above scenario to be a valid example of religious or conscience objection. They were unable to come up with any real-life examples of anything remotely close to this ever happening.

HHS Clarifies Potential Conscience Conflicts

HHS provided more in-depth answers in the rule seemingly not taken into consideration. “For example, the Department believes driving a person to a hospital or clinic for a scheduled abortion could constitute ‘assisting in the performance of’ an abortion, as would physically delivering drugs for inducing abortion.”

It continued, “To the extent commenters are referring to emergency transportation of persons experiencing unforeseen complications after, for example, an abortion procedure, the Department does not believe such a scenario would implicate the definition of ‘assist in the performance of’ an abortion, because the complications in need of treatment would be an unforeseen and unintended byproduct of a completed procedure. Further, the Department is not aware of any entities or medical professionals that would object to treating someone, or transporting someone to treatment, under these circumstances.”

Specifically referencing the hypothetical scenario of the pregnant woman with an ectopic pregnancy, it states, “However, as a general matter, the Department does not believe that mere speculation that an objected‐to service or procedure may occur suffices to establish a specific and reasonable connection between the objected‐to service or procedure and the act of transporting the patient.”

As for refusing to treat LGBT people, the reoccurring argument is, as The Advocate stated, “It could jeopardize the care of transgender people, of HIV-positive people, those taking PrEP, patients seeking abortion or contraception, and more.” The HHS countered the argument of access to care, saying, “Studies have specifically found that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that conscience protections have negative effects on access to care.” It further argues, “The Department is unaware of any cases claiming denial of service regarding these procedures brought under any of the statutes implemented by this rule.”

Politicians and the Media Consider Religion an Excuse

In spite of these clarifications, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra argued, “Today’s court ruling blocked the President’s heartless, unlawful attempt to restrict the healthcare rights of women, LGBTQ individuals, and countless others.” Jamie Gliksberg of Lambda Legal agreed, saying, “That is now three judges in two weeks who have recognized the Denial of Care Rule for what it is, an egregious and unconstitutional attack on women, LGBT people and other vulnerable populations.” What appears to be ignored in these objections is the fact that the rule itself merely clarifies and provides more specific instruction for enforcing already existing law dating back to the 1970s.

Despite the insistence of the media in describing the rule, as Bloomberg Law articulated, “A Trump administration rule that allows health care workers to deny care based on their religious and moral beliefs,” the rule does nothing to “allow” anything. It serves only to provide a cohesive guide on how to interpret and enforce religious and conscience laws already active. One area that is very relevant, however, is how the rule helps to protect health-care workers themselves from discrimination based on religious or moral beliefs.

In 2009, a survey of 2,865 members of faith-based medical associations found 39 percent reported feeling pressure or discrimination from administrators or faculty due to their moral, ethical, or religious beliefs. In terms of referring patients for a procedure they morally opposed, 32 percent reported being pressured into doing so. Frustratingly, 20 percent of medical students said they would not pursue the fields of obstetrics or gynecology due to the stigma they faced for their religious beliefs.

That same year, the New England Journal of Medicine dismissed these concerns, saying, “Qualms about abortion, sterilization, and birth control? Do not practice women’s health.” In comments submitted to the 2011 rule addressing this same issue, “Thousands also feared personnel with objections would be terminated or otherwise unable to find employment, training, or opportunities to advance in their fields.”

Christians and Religious Minorities Have Valid Concerns

In 2016, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) issued its ethics opinion on conscience objections, stating, “Providers with moral or religious objections should either practice in proximity to individuals who do not share their views or ensure that referral processes are in place so that patients have access to the service that the physician does not wish to provide.” It seems the passionate opponents of discrimination are advocating for the wrong marginalized group.

What we have is a series of poorly constructed assumptions and prejudices informing those who oppose religious and conscience protections. Based on their biases, they project motivations onto the very people who are vulnerable, pushing them out of the medical profession altogether. Where there is very little, if any, evidence of targeted discrimination against women or LGBT people seeking medical treatment, there is a great deal of valid concern from Christians and other religious minorities that must be heard.

Religious and conscience protections do not “give a license” to discriminate. They merely protect health care workers from being forced to participate in practices such as elective sterilization, elective abortion, and assisted suicide. They do not ban these practices from being offered or permit patients in need of care to be tossed out onto the streets. They simply allow individuals to choose which actions they take and which they will not based on religious or moral objections. The rest is pure speculation without substance.

Chick-Fil-A Talks Out Of Both Sides Of Its Mouth On Charitable Giving,"Franklin Graham, whose courage and conviction I greatly respect, has spoken with Chick-fil-A’s CEO, Dan Cathy, and according to Graham, Cathy denies any shift in CFA’s policy. “I picked up the phone and called Dan Cathy. Dan was very clear that they have not bowed down to anyone’s demands, including the LGBTQ community,” Graham said. “They will continue to support whoever they want to support. They haven’t changed who they are or what they believe. Chick-fil-A remains committed to Christian values. Dan Cathy assured me that this isn’t going to change.”

It looks like Cathy and his president and chief operating officer, Tim Tassopoulos, are going to have to get their story straight. Tassopoulos communicated quite a different message in his deliberate announcement in Bisnow to the LGBT bullies:

‘There’s no question we know that, as we go into new markets, we need to be clear about who we are,’ Chick-fil-A President and Chief Operating Officer Tim Tassopoulos said in an interview with Bisnow. ‘There are lots of articles and newscasts about Chick-fil-A [critical of our support of anti-gay-marriage charities], and we thought we needed to be clear about our message.’ … Future partners could include faith-based and non-faith-based charities, but the company said none of the organizations have anti-LGBT positions. … After years of ‘taking it on the chin,’ as a Chick-fil-A executive told Bisnow, the latest round of headlines was impossible to ignore. This time, it was impeding the company’s growth.

Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council was quite right in his comment on this interview: “Chick-fil-A didn’t just switch their giving practices, they broadcasted it. They made a conscious choice to draw attention to this very public divorce from two Bible-believing charities. And then, in a calculated move, announced their support was going to an organization that, on its website, openly and proudly supports everything about the LGBT community.”

Chick-fil-A calculated that, by making this announcement, the LGBT bullies would ease up. Big miscalculation. Nor does it cohere with making the zealous LGBT organization Covenant House one of three main recipients of a $9 million Chick-fil-A donation, replacing among others the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, The Salvation Army, and the Paul Anderson Youth Home — all organizations LGBT bullies have targeted for expressions of Christianity.

Chick-fil-A Sends Sin Tax to LGBT-Linked Groups

Covenant House boasted about its participation in NYC’s Gay Pride Parade in March 2019, saying, “Celebrating PRIDE! This past Sunday our youth, staff and volunteers enjoyed the large crowds, rainbow colors and festive music at New York City’s Pride Parade. Pride is all about love, acceptance, celebration. … We encourage kids to be exactly who they are and we celebrate their uniqueness and individuality.” (For more pictures go here, here, and here.)

Every one of its 16 U.S. and Canadian Covenant House programs has undergone the assessment of Cyndi Lauper’s LGBT-fascist “True Colors” to insure they are fully on board with the entire homosexual and transgender agenda. To work there, one must affirm transgenderism and homosexual practice as part of a young person’s “authentic self.” “Even though we are educating staff and think they are on the same page, they may not be,” said Renee Trincanello, associate executive director at Covenant House Florida.

What do we know of Covenant House’s partner “True Colors”? True Colors “creates a welcoming environment for LGBTQ youth by using visual cues like safe space stickers, all gender restroom signs, and pronoun buttons.” That’s right, first-order business at Covenant House is everyone declaring the pronouns by which they want to be known, thereby coercing all others to accept faux transgender identity through mandatory speech. There can never be too much coercive indoctrination when pushing LGBT ideology.

Covenant House proudly declares on its website that “LGBTQ young people” should not only be kept “safe, housed,” but also “celebrated … not just accepted … for who they are” (emphasis theirs). So Chick-fil-A is not remaining neutral in the culture war but is siding with organizations that promote what God views as abhorrent. Yet CFA’s Vision Statement says the company exists first and foremost “to glorify God.”

Covenant House is also hardly a cash-strapped organization. According to GuideStar, it had gross receipts of $108.6 million in 2018, with donors including Walmart, Delta, PayPal, and the National Basketball Association. That doesn’t include all its various chapters in different states, provinces, and cities in the U.S. and Canada.

The New York chapter alone had gross receipts of $23.4 million, for instance, and California had $15.8 million. It has been raking in this kind of money for decades. Did CFA feel bad that Covenant House was raking in only this kind of dough, or was this a public relations outreach to mollify LGBT bullies?

Covenant House’s founder, Bruce Ritter, was a Franciscan priest. In 1989, The New York Post reported in deeply researched article that Ritter had allegedly sexually molested young men at Covenant House for years. Lawsuits by his victims against Covenant House are still ongoing. Apparently, too, this once-Catholic organization now takes young women to abortion clinics.

One would think CFA would carefully vet an organization to which it plans to donate millions of dollars. The worrisome concern is that it probably did.

These Aren’t the Only Problems at Chick-fil-A

As it seeks to expand in Canadian markets, Chick-fil-A has hired an international lobbying firm, Navigator, that according to Charles McVety, president of the Institute for Canadian Values, is the “number one gay lobbying firm” in Canada, responsible “for successfully pushing for homosexual ‘marriage’ at the same time … other Christian conservatives [were working] to oppose it.”

According to the Toronto Star, CFA plans to open 15 restaurants in the Toronto area but has received a cold reception. So Navigator wants to “facilitate open dialogue and foster long-term relationships with key decision makers in areas of interest to their operations.” Clearly, this is part of CFA’s overall efforts to blunt criticisms from LGBT activists.

Compromise has been going on for a while. It is just now getting more blatant. Back in 2015, Chick-fil-A was listed as a sponsor for an LGBT film festival. By 2011, CFA had stopped giving to LGBT bullies’ big-target organizations, such as Family Research Council, Exodus International, and Eagle Forum, in an obvious effort to mollify critics.

Chick-fil-A had a record $3 billion in earnings for 2018. Apparently, that was not enough. What does one call prostituting one’s values for the sake of still more money and more social approval, dumping one’s loyal lover in the process?

I can tell you what Old Testament prophets would have said: Chick-fil-A is now officially a greedy and cowardly corporate whore, like nearly all other large corporations. Its betrayal now is worse than if it had started out with such an MO. It would have been better if it had never existed.

At the very least, Christians should no longer give Chick-fil-A special support. They should also take a good long while before patronizing CFA again, if ever. Christians need to send a message loud and clear. Apparently CFA’s president really likes “clarity.”

What Chick-fil-A Can Do to Clear Its Name

At this point, CFA’s primary customer service base is going to need to hear a consistent and clear word from the company and see some action.

1. The COO should reverse himself unequivocally and clearly. Preferably, he should be fired for making the foolhardy executive decision of the decade that alienated CFA’s chief customer base. I don’t see how his evangelical customers can trust an organization he heads. In case you are worried about how he will survive financially if he’s terminated, he’s a billionaire. He’ll do just fine.

2. Chick-fil-A must dump Covenant House, because it is a rabid LGBT organization that corrupts children and doesn’t reflect CFA’s Vision Statement “to glorify God.”

3. Chick-fil-A must reinstate as a major recipient of its donations a Christian organization that clearly does not affirm homosexual practice or transgenderism. The promise that Christian groups will be “considered” in the future (without an explicit indication that groups targeted slanderously by “LGBTQ” bullies are included, by the way) is not enough. “Will be considered” is a meaningless gesture to appease CFA’s primary customary service base while still doing the bidding of the LGBT bullies.

At present, I see the likelihood of Chick-fil-A doing even one, let alone all three, of these things as slim to none. Astonish me.

Twitter Suspends Journalist Andy Ngo For Tweeting Transgender Facts,"Journalist Andy Ngo has been temporarily suspended from Twitter, as reported by The Post Millennial, for violating its rules on “hateful conduct.” The lockout resulted from his Nov. 20 reply to Chelsea Clinton’s tweet on the Transgender Day of Remembrance.

She shared LGBT advocacy group Human Rights Campaign’s message, stating, “Since 2013, more than 150 trans people have been murdered in the U.S., the majority Black transgender women. On #TDoR2019, we remember and honor the lives lost, hold their loved ones in our hearts and must commit to doing all we can to end this epidemic of violence and hate.”

Ngo replied, “The US is one of the safest countries for trans people. The murder rate for trans victims is actually lower than that for cis population. Also, who is behind the murders? Mostly black men.”

While Twitter did not specify which part of Ngo’s tweet constituted “hateful conduct,” a review of what he said demonstrates his statement was entirely factual. Forbes reported that in 2019 (data from Oct. 1, 2018, to present), 331 transgender people were killed worldwide. Of these murders, 130 occurred in Brazil and 63 in Mexico. The United States had 30 reported murders.

Of the murders occurring in the United States, only one, the murder of Paris Cameron, fits the description of a bias-motivated killing. Cameron was one of five victims in a Memorial Day mass shooting at a house party in Detroit. Devon Robinson committed the crime, also murdering two gay men and two other victims in an attempt to target LGBT people.

Andy Ngo Merely Tweeted the Facts

The United States is, in fact, one of the safest countries in the world for transgender people. From 2015 to 2019, the “Human Rights Campaign reported 118 transgender murders and after careful review, four cases fit a bias-motivation.” In 2018, the murder rate was 5.0 per 100,000, or 15,498 murders nationwide.

Clinton specifically mentioned the majority of U.S. trans murder victims are black transgender males, and this is true. Of the known murders between 2015 and 2019, 67 percent were black. But the point Ngo makes is also factually true: 92 percent of the known killers of these victims were also black.

Ngo mentioned this fact, pushing back on the continued narrative that transgender victims’ race must be a factor in motivating violence against them. But observing the race of both the victims and the killers, and considering the vast majority of victims knew their killers as sex partners, race itself becomes entirely irrelevant — which matters in this discussion.

Essentially, no part of Ngo’s tweet was factually incorrect or offensive. So why did Twitter consider it to violate its policy? A journalist stating verifiable facts on a public platform should not be at risk for removal from that platform due simply to a minority of people who take arbitrary offense.

Twitter Thinks of Itself as Journalist-Friendly

Twitter boasts that its platform is unique for journalists, saying, “Twitter is a window into what’s happening in the world, which is why some of the most active Twitter accounts belong to journalists. News often breaks first on Twitter, and everyone from national media outlets to reporters on the ground often use Twitter to update the public on developing stories.”

Twitter claims to encourage active participation as well, arguing, “People are more likely to reply to journalists who are willing to engage with them by replying, Retweeting, answering questions, or soliciting news tips. That, in turn, increases a reporter’s followers and drives more interest and trust in the journalist’s work.” What is more powerful than a journalist speaking directly to the daughter of a former president and challenging her statements?

In 2018, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted, “One of the most important constituencies we serve is our journalist population. Has been since day 1. We don’t mean to shift the work here. We must build tools to help (and need to work together to do that). We can’t be a useful service without the integrity journalists bring.”

Just last week, ahead of a massive media merger, Paul Bascobert, CEO of Gannett Media Corp., one of the largest media organizations, told CNN business, “This idea of protecting journalism is the right thing to do; it’s also good business, because the digital businesses we want to build in the future are built on the trust and the engagement from the consumer side, from the readers, the subscribers.”

It is universally agreed upon that journalism is the foundation of our media. But how can it survive if media tolerates only one selected view?

Twitter Must Stop Arbitrary Censorship

Conservatives have long sounded the alarm on Twitter’s selective enforcement of its rules and its targeting of right-leaning voices, and this most recent censorship illustrates why. Ngo is a respected and prominent journalist and the editor-at-large of The Post Millennial. He risked his safety to report on the violence of Antifa, who brutally attacked him while he was performing this vital function just last summer.

He is not a conspiracy theorist or a hate group leader or any number of other more obvious targets of Twitter-implemented “safety” initiatives. He is a journalist who challenged a public figure on facts, and Twitter shut down his voice for doing so. This should alarm everyone in the industry, not just those on the right.

Sadly, LGBT media and advocacy organizations have long refused to answer challenges from journalists such as Ngo. On June 29, shortly after Antifa brutally assaulted Ngo, Charlotte Clymer, a communications staffer for the Human Rights Campaign who has blocked several right-leaning journalists on the platform, myself included, tweeted, “Andy Ngo intentionally provokes people on the left to drive his content. Being attacked today on video taken by an actual journalist (because Ngo is definitely not) is the greatest thing that could have happened to his career. You know it. I know it. He knows it. We all know it.” Clymer later apologized for the comment.

Every journalist, newspaper, news website, and journalism school and association should be outraged by this and capable of putting politics aside to object to it. Twitter silencing any journalist for merely performing his job is a threat to all journalism, and Twitter must recognize it cannot play favorites with who it allows and does not allow to report on its website.

More importantly, media figures such as Chelsea Clinton should be championing journalists brave enough to stand up and speak truth to power, even on issues with which they may not agree. The unique quality of Twitter is the ability to do just that. If voices as prominent as Ngo’s can be so easily shut down, what purpose does the platform serve at all?

Chick-Fil-A Really Is Funding A Group That Hosts Drag Queen Story Hour,"Fast-food giant Chick-fil-A is sinking deeper into the controversy it created when it announced the Chick-fil-A Foundation would no longer donate to organizations that uphold a Christian ethic regarding sex and marriage.

As LifeSiteNews reported, the Chick-fil-A Foundation has given money to Covenant House, an organization that aims to address youth homelessness. While its overall objective is virtuous, Covenant House New York’s affiliate is listed as one of the “community partners” that has provided “community space” to host Drag Queen Story Hour, according to Dragqueenstoryhour.org’s NYC page.

Chick-fil-A Donates to Drag Queen Host’s Partner

Drag Queen Story Hours have been cropping up in libraries and other public spaces across the country. These events consist of men dressing up as women to read or tell stories based in gender ideology to children. “DQSH captures the imagination and play of the gender fluidity of childhood and gives kids glamorous, positive, and unabashedly queer role models,” according to the Drag Queen Story Hour website. The site encourages visitors to #STANDWITHSTORYHOUR and help raise $35,000 by the end of the year to “fight back against anti-LGBTQ censorship and attacks.”

Covenant House, the recipient of at least $230,000 of Chick-fil-A’s donations, bills itself as “the largest provider of services to youth facing homelessness in the Americas” and provides shelter to about 400 kids between 16 and 21 years old. Its website says it seeks to provide houses that are “welcoming, affirming, and safe for LGBTQ youth.” New York-based Covenant House has nearly two dozen affiliates all over the United States and South America, but the parent organization and its New York affiliate in particular have indeed put a focus on LGBT politics.

An examination of Chick-fil-A Foundation’s 2017 and 2018 IRS 990 forms reveal it gave $30,000 to Covenant House Georgia and $100,000 to Covenant House California, neither of which appear to fund DQSH or any other anti-biblical agendas. But in 2018, Chick-fil-A also gave $100,000 to parent organization “Covenant House.”

“The Cov,” as its residents call it, has marched in New York’s Pride Parade multiple times. While the New York affiliate did not receive Chick-fil-A funding according to currently available tax documents, the parent organization proudly advertises it has collaborated with True Colors United, which provides “training and education” in LGBT matters. Covenant House employs the True Colors “inclusion assessment” to create a more “LGBTQ-inclusive and -affirming program and environment.”

Chick-fil-A Tries to Shake ‘Anti-LGBT’ Label

Despite the media grilling the restaurant chain after CEO Dan Cathy’s 2012 statement that he was “guilty as charged” with regard to supporting traditional family, Chick-fil-A has since doubled its growth. Over the course of the last few years, however, it has faced a handful of setbacks, as a few landlords and local politicians have sought to block its restaurants — expressly because of its Christian values, namely a biblical understanding of sexuality.

Bisnow reported last month that company leadership “felt a new message was needed — especially in foreign markets, where the most prominent brand exposure to Chick-fil-A are headlines about its support for organizations with anti-LGBT stances.”

Attempting to explain its funding decisions, Vice President of Corporate Responsibility and Executive Director of the Chick-fil-A Foundation Rodney Bullard said it “don’t want [its] intent and [its] work to be encumbered by someone else’s politics or cultural war,” saying it is “mindful” of anything that “gets in the way of their mission.”

The “anti-gay” smear encumbered Chick-fil-A, but ditching it meant wading deeper into the political and cultural wars, not out of them. Chick-fil-A shocked Christians when it stopped funding the Paul Anderson Youth Home, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, and The Salvation Army due to their “anti-LGBT” reputations based merely in their Christian affiliation (regardless of their basis in reality).

After Chick-fil-A’s announcement that it would cease funding, The Salvation Army released a statement saying it was “saddened” a corporate partner would divert its funding from the largest social services provider in the world despite its commitment to all three of Chick-fil-A’s philanthropic objectives.

Chick-fil-A Takes the Left’s Side in the Culture War

Chick-fil-A has also donated to the Young Women’s Christian Association, which is not as innocent as it sounds. YWCA opposed Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination, saying his position on the Supreme Court would threaten “all reproductive rights, particularly Roe V. Wade” and that he shows a “blatant disregard” for LGBT rights. The YWCA has partnered with Planned Parenthood for a “chat/text program” that enables girls to contact the abortion-specialized organization through text or instant messaging.

As the Radiance Foundation’s Ryan Bomberger has laid out, IRS forms show the Chick-fil-A Foundation has also given to other pro-abortion and pro-LGBT groups, including the New Leaders Council. As PJ Media reported, the $2,500 donation to the Southern Poverty Law Center for which Chick-fil-A has taken so much heat was made by a volunteer member of the Chick-fil-A Foundation advisory board after “each volunteer was given the opportunity to recommend a grant recipient.” SPLC is extremely hostile to Christianity and has listed the Family Research Council, a pro-life and pro-family Christian organization, as a hate group.

Regardless of the details, Chick-fil-A is in the middle of a political and cultural war, whether it doubles down on one side or jumps to another. When a political wing is so fired up it can extract an apology from Twitter’s CEO after he innocently ate a sandwich at the restaurant during Pride Month, you know Chick-fil-A has a loyal and aggressive opposition.

As I wrote in November, Chick-fil-A will never escape the furnace of outrage because the left is fundamentally anti-biblical. Not only has Chick-fil-A failed to silence the “anti-LGBT” criticism, but it has betrayed its base of loyal supporters. Halting donations to groups maligned as “anti-LGBT” is one thing: frustrating and foolish. But the lengths to which the Sabbath-respecting restaurant has gone to change its perception is beyond the pale for Christians.

Christians Must Protect Children

Christians in the West tend to waver somewhere between long-suffering and complacent on cultural sins. But threats to children — such as the depraved indoctrination of Drag Queen Story Hour — seem to be where they will sometimes draw the line (with the curious exception of sending their children to government schools even when they can afford not to).

That’s because the Bible is packed full of passages about the value of children: a “heritage from the Lord,” “knit together” in the womb, and known before birth. In Scripture, God call Christians to look after the fatherless, “train up a child in the way he should go,” and not “despise” children — even saying “the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”

Chick-fil-A’s restaurants are family-friendly not because kids are cute and well-behaved but because children are precious to God. Fostering children’s wellbeing is the chief purpose of marriage — the epicenter of Chick-fil-A’s years-long controversy — not companionship, which is why Cathy jumped to defend natural marriage in 2012.

Kids can’t defend themselves, so adults must protect them. Given the unbiblical nature of some of Chick-fil-A’s philanthropic activities, it is no wonder Family Research Council President Tony Perkins has called for Christians to boycott Chick-fil-A.

Chick-fil-A’s actions leave an impression of a foolish attempt to ingratiate the anti-Christian revolutionaries who seek the company’s demise. The Bible has much to say about fools, too: “Whoever digs a pit will fall into it, and a stone will come back on him who starts it rolling.”

Lesbian Ads On The Hallmark Channel Are Just The Beginning,"On the latest episode of “Everybody on the Internet is Angry,” the Hallmark Channel found itself caught between a Christian rock and an LGBT hard place. After the network ran a commercial from online wedding firm Zola featuring a lesbian wedding, One Million Moms, a division of the American Family Association, “voiced its concern and gave Hallmark the opportunity to do the right thing.”

Hallmark quickly dropped the ad from its schedule, but after complaints from “prominent LGBT celebrities and advocacy groups” and the rise of #BoycottHallmarkChannel on Twitter, the network reversed its decision, with Hallmark CEO Mike Perry apologizing for the hurt the company had caused and stating, “Hallmark will be working with GLAAD to better represent the LGBT community across our portfolio of brands.”

To some, it may seem this fiasco could have been avoided if certain Christian Hallmark channel viewers weren’t such sensitive babies. “Is the image of two women getting married so troubling,” some might think, “that you can no longer stand to see if Candace Cameron Bure falls in love with the handsome banker who was sent to town to foreclose on her parents’ cinnamon farm?”

But easy as it is to cry “baby” and “bigot” at those who don’t want gay weddings lauded during commercial breaks, the truth is, like most bursts of the culture wars, this specific battle wasn’t really about the outward issue. The problem for many Christians is not so much the ad itself but what the ad represents.

The Hallmark Channel Offered Cleaner Entertainment

In a theological sense, the Hallmark Channel is not a Christian broadcasting network. More to the point, the 6,000 original “Christmas” movies the network airs every December are not genuinely Christian films in content.

The characters rarely, if ever, pray or worship. The plots never revolve around the heroine saving a church or reading Luke’s nativity account to the flannel-clad, hunky widower’s precocious daughter. The stories never end with the couple kneeling in a sanctuary on Christmas Eve, proclaiming the wonders of the God who took on human flesh to save them from their sins.

But, culturally speaking, Hallmark Christmas movies are noticeably Christian. The characters don’t take off their clothes, murder anyone, or use profanity. The hero loves children and defends the poor. The heroine who begins the story loving her self-involved life in the city chooses family and a life of self-sacrifice in her hometown by the end of the tale.

If you’re a pious Christian mom who wants to escape into a universe where all the cynicism and immorality of modern life aren’t allowed, or if you want to snuggle up with your eight-year-old daughter and watch a silly movie without having to explain inappropriate content you weren’t expecting, the Hallmark Channel is about the only place left that will let you do it.

So when an ad featuring a lesbian couple airs during a commercial break on the Hallmark Channel, it doesn’t upset you because your fragile little Christian heart can’t handle the image of two women in wedding dresses. It upsets you because the ad indicates that the secular left, led by the LGBT mafia, have discovered your last remaining hideout, planted their flag in the ground, and claimed it as their own.

The LGBT Mob Infiltrates All Cultural Spaces

Once upon a time, you could watch a sizable chunk of network TV shows with your children without exposing them to programs that praised fornication (of both the heterosexual and homosexual varieties). Then the children of the sexual revolution got control of the writers’ rooms and the programming decisions, and now you don’t dare let them near a Thursday evening sitcom for fear they’ll contract HPV via satellite dish.

Once, you could take your kids to a Star Wars or superhero movie without being told you weren’t welcome in Skywalkerland or Iron Man Village if you believed homosexuality was contrary to God’s law. Not anymore. Once, you could trust Disney and PBS not to fight actively against the Christian beliefs you wanted your children to hold. Then Disney and PBS stuck gay characters in programs aimed at preschoolers.

Likewise, outside film and TV, you’ve experienced the same thing. The same LGBT movement that claimed almost every network and film series you and your children once watched has now claimed virtually every institution in your daily life.

You worry the local public school will indoctrinate your kids. You worry your daughter will lose her shot at a scholarship because the LGBT mobs have bullied the school board into allowing males identifying as females on women’s athletic teams. You’re no longer welcome at your LGBT-compliant local library if you don’t want sexual deviants dancing in front of your children.

No matter how respectfully you speak, you’re not free to share your Christian beliefs about marriage or gender identity in your place of work, because the human resources department won’t tolerate anything but full-throated endorsement of the LGBT agenda.

The LGBT Mob Won’t Stop at Hallmark

Now GLAAD has showed up to invade the Hallmark Christmas movie bubble, the last place Christian values were still welcome, and bullied the CEO into alienating Hallmark’s Christian audience to avoid angering the LGBT mob.

As obnoxious Christian scolds who are too cool to get their hands dirty in the culture wars are wont to note, Hallmark’s capitulation to GLAAD isn’t exactly the worst thing to happen to Christians in recent memory. Nobody was killed, imprisoned, or beaten — something many Christians in the world don’t have luxury of saying when they face the kind of persecution the unbelieving world is tossing at them.

This is, of course, true. As I’ve noted, it’s also true that Hallmark wasn’t actually producing genuine Christian material prior to kneeling before GLAAD and pledging to help make the most overrepresented demographic on television even more overrepresented.

But it’s important for all Christians not to miss the three-fold point. First, the LGBT mafia zealously desires to drive faithful Christians out of any space where they are welcome. Second, the LGBT mafia is proving to be ruthlessly efficient at carrying out this goal.

Third, the same ruthlessly efficient mob probably won’t be content to take away every metaphorical sanctuary we have and then stop short of seizing our literal ones. If they wouldn’t let us celebrate cheesy Hallmark Christmas without celebrating their sin, they won’t let us celebrate actual Jesus Christmas that way either.

Buttigieg: I Can Be President BC I'm A Gay Man In 'Mike Pence's Indiana',"During the sixth round of Democratic debates Thursday, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg told Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., he was fit to run for president because he won an election in “Mike Pence’s Indiana.”

“We should have someone heading up this ticket that has actually won and has been able to show that they can gather the support that you talk about. Like moderate Republicans and Independents, as well as a fired-up Democratic base. And not just done it once, I have done it three times. I think winning matters,” Klobuchar said.

“If you want to talk about the capacity to win, try putting together a coalition to bring you back to office with 80 percent of the vote, as a gay dude in Mike Pence’s Indiana,” Buttigieg said.

Here are some pictures of Buttigieg “struggling” in Indiana when Pence was governor.

Some pictures of Pete Buttigieg struggling to endure in “Mike Pence’s Indiana” pic.twitter.com/wXfaeXpvgm — Jimmy (@JimmyPrinceton) December 20, 2019

Buttigieg did not come out as homosexual until years after he was elected mayor in the town of South Bend, population 100,000. The first election Buttigieg ran for after disclosing his sexual behavior was for chairman of the Democratic National Committee, an election that did not take place in Indiana.

Even if Buttigieg ran for re-election in South Bend, he wouldn’t be running in “Mike Pence’s Indiana,” because South Bend is a historically blue city. Every mayor since 1972 has been a Democrat and in the 2016 election, South Bend was one of only four counties that voted for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. Further, and perhaps obviously, Pence no longer holds office in Indiana.

Pence in fact presided over the Republican state legislature’s capitulation to pro-LGBT business interests, who snowballed a state version of the Bill Clinton-signed Religious Freedom Restoration Act into special legal protections for people who claim an LGBT designation. As Dennis Saffran explained in 2015 in these pages:

In caving to corporate and elite pressure to ‘fix’ Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Gov. Mike Pence and the rest of the state’s laughingstock Republican leadership have ironically bungled into amending it in a way that now makes Indiana the most hostile state in the country to the conscience rights the original law was designed to protect. The hastily and stupidly crafted amendment they enacted during Holy Week provides that Indiana’s RFRA can never be used as a defense in any gay rights or other civil rights proceeding by anyone other than a clergyman, church, or religious institution.

Buttigieg vastly overstated his credibility and record of bringing together diverse coalitions and winning elections. He’s also giving a false portrayal of Pence and state Republicans’ actions that created legal preferences for LGBT people over people of faith, even though Pence often gives the opposite impression of his own record while out giving speeches.

The Revolution Came For J.K. Rowling,"It is said that hell hath no fury as a Scotswoman scorned. While reading Maddy Kearns, one of the finest recent exports from these gloomy islands to the fairer shores (lightly balancing the trauma of unleashing John Oliver on Americans), on the cancellation of Joanne Kathleen Rowling for asserting women are women, I realized how hapless Englishmen must have had their knees shaking facing Robert the Bruce in Bannockburn.

Long story short, a think tanker lost her job for speaking the simple, factual, biological truth that men and women on God’s green earth are born different and will remain different ‘til the end of times, and no amount of scientific wizardry or willy-nilly genital modification will make that disappear. Just like a cripple doesn’t prove that humans are not by design bipedal, an intersex person doesn’t prove that, in strictly scientific terms it is the males who breed and the females who give birth.

But, since this is 2019, free speech in the United Kingdom isn’t codified in a written constitution, and, most importantly, since British judges are fundamentally so illiberal and activist that they all make Elena Kagan sound like Edmund Burke, this poor woman lost her job from a think tank. The Guardian reports that she was accused of using “offensive and exclusionary” language, for the crime of tweeting “men cannot change into women,” which is apparently protected under ​some European Union Equality Act.

Then it took a somewhat surprising turn. So far, these type of cancellations have been unanimous. There has been no barking back, so to speak. This time, however, for some reason, the Harry Potter author who hadn’t tweeted since November took to Twitter for a fierce reprimand. The reaction was devastating.

Our resident village gossips at Vox asked if Rowling just destroyed the legacy of Harry Potter with transphobia. Mary Sue, the feminist blog, was apparently shocked. CNN said Rowling was flat-out wrong, as she had no experience about transgenders, like the author of Harry Potter has no idea of imaginative beings. Predictably, both the New York Times and Washington Post found two transgender people to write about how Rowling hates them.

Meanwhile, the LGBT activist lobbies were not silent either. From the American Civil Liberties Union, to Amnesty, to GLAAD, to PinkNews, all the transnational LGBT activist groups were equally vocal in denouncing not just Rowling, but also other prominent women who are against this new movement, including former athletes like Martina Navratilova and Sharron Davies, as well as comedian Ricky Gervais.

Rowling and the other celebs who are slowly speaking out against the creeping trans orthodoxy are a litmus test for these groups. If they succeed, the revolt will spread, and more and more people will see the same slippery slope conservatives have been warning about: if this menace is not confronted, telling the truth about the sexes will lead to not just a loss of honor, but also to losses of jobs, and even jail. This is not a phenomenon solely in the U.K. In Iowa a man was jailed for 16 years for burning a rainbow flag.

Yet, despite Maddy’s considerable bravery speaking up on television and eloquent defence of Rowling, somehow, I don’t feel compelled to congratulate Rowling. Why should we congratulate the same author whose work is a simplistic Manichean struggle against magic Nazis, and has repeatedly caved in​ ​to leftist demands thus far, only to see the revolution coming for her at last?

I am old enough to remember the “Dumbledore is suddenly gay” controversy, and the resistance against President Trump named (no marks for creativity) “Dumbledore’s Army.” The woke generation is a product of Rowling’s philosophy, and a bunch of people Rowling repeatedly encouraged on Twitter for every liberal cause she supported.

They are a generation of simpletons, only understanding a grand struggle between good (which means “what I feel good about”) versus evil (“anything I oppose”). It is somewhat fittingly amusing to see the Jacobins coming for the Girondins. The revolution is always hungry for consuming more of its own. There’s no end to purity when everything is dependent on feelings, and all social gods eventually disappoint.

The issue is not just about transgenderism. This overwhelming woke era is essentially just silly outrages for a generation of people who are among the most privileged financially in the Western world. Like everything else, it is a ridiculous utopian fad that will die down in time, like hippies or heroin chic, leaving a trail of destruction and broken and scarred lives. It’s an effect, not the cause.

Consider the history of the late 19th-century Victorian Europe, and you’d see a bunch of wealthy people who believe in all the conventional wisdom of their times, have not seen great power wars for decades, know relative peace in a world where there ​is​ enormous free movement and free trade, claim to be rational and scientific and children of the enlightenment, and yet believe in planchets, witchcraft, the healing effects of cocaine and clairvoyance, and skull shapes determining intelligence. Nothing is ever thematically new in this planet. History is cyclical.

However, the difference between our times and the Victorians is that the Victorians knew civilization was more important than individual lives. Of course there were vices in the Victorian age as well. But they were astute enough to understand that normalization of deviance is detrimental to civilization.

The entire history of humanity until then was one to reach and move beyond the original state of nature and savage existence. Manners, stoicism, discipline, public propriety, sense of style, merit, emotional composure, bravery, a belief in the laws of Nature, and most importantly sacrifice for a greater cause, were the marks of an advanced civilization. The Victorians worked to perfect that civilizationally, even at the cost of individual lives and feelings.

The art, adventure, architecture, science, and music of that era harked to some ethereal glory, something to leave behind for posterity to remember. All that has been in an exact reverse since the 1960s sexual revolution, a deliberate attempt by a section of the elites to turn back the contemporary sexual and social ethos in time to a pre-civilised, primitive existence.

While the Victorians aspired to earn respect, the modern society promotes those who demand respect, but because they want to show how vulnerable and weak they are. It creates a paradox, in which the most emotionally fragile narcissists group together like a pack of hyenas to bully others while claiming victimhood.

Liberals think intersectional progressivism and post-modernism is an aberration of liberalism and modernism, whereas conservatives think post-modernism and progressivism is the logical conclusion of modernism and liberalism. The ‘60s liberals gave birth to this monster that now smites them.

Liberalism, from Immanuel Kant and Jeremy Bentham onwards, is based on the modernist and rationalist paradigm. G.W.F. Hegel twisted it, Karl Marx twisted Hegel further, and Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and Herbert Marcuse twisted Marx. The reason to get this clear is to understand that trans movement ideologues are the ideological children of the same 1960s radical-feminists, sometimes namecalled TERFs, who once proudly wanted to destroy the old order, the hetero-patriarchal society, by destroying its primary unit of family, in their own words, through “promoting polyamory, promiscuity, pornography and prostitution.” Now that they have turned full Cylon, it is somewhat amusing to conservatives. But hey, conservatives warned about this for decades. If only someone listened!

Libby Emmons wrote that the last decade is one of the trans movement. One feels optimistic that the tide is turning. That doesn’t mean all is well, or that things will be easy for conservatives in the future. But extremism of any kind eventually overreaches and cocoons itself from greater society.

That’s because most people are essentially normal, and they don’t want to be a part of nonsensical and unnatural crusades. From the Me Too movement to the transgender movement, everything is the logical culmination of a social revolution that originated 80 years back. And every revolution inevitably invites a disproportionate reaction.

Conservatives should be careful, but they should also take heart that this is mostly an intra-liberal/intra-feminist fight. And nature always takes its course and balances itself.​

An Order That Shuts Down Christian Charities Doesn't Deserve To Live,"It is a basic Christian teaching that good works are insufficient for spiritual salvation. We should also remember they are unlikely to suffice for cultural and political salvation either.

Chick-fil-A’s abandonment of The Salvation Army is yesterday’s news, but its lessons should be remembered, for they explain our cultural and political trajectory. That the chicken chain capitulated even though everyone was “eating mor chikin” is instructive regarding the power of the LBGT lobby and its allies. That they directed this power against a Christian organization dedicated to feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and sheltering the homeless — including those who identify as LGBT — is even more instructive.

It exemplifies how hard-liners are driving the cultural left. It is not clear that a majority even of those who identity as LGBT hate The Salvation Army. For example, Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg volunteered for the organization (albeit for a photo op) a couple of years back. Now he is facing criticism from LGBT activists, as those running the movement want total victory, not coexistence. And they are winning.

The campaign included government officials from Buffalo, New York, to San Antonio, Texas, retaliating against Chick-fil-A for its support of The Salvation Army. Even without full control over the government, the left has been aggressive in its use of government power against Christians who believe traditional teachings on human sexuality. The left seems to target particularly those engaged in charitable work, rather than protecting them on account of their good works.

The left’s legal wing is trying to compel Christian hospitals to perform abortions and sex-change surgeries, Christian schools to affirm same-sex relationships, and Christian charities such as women’s shelters to pretend men can be women. A purportedly serious Democratic presidential candidate wanted to tax dissenting Christian organizations, including churches, into oblivion.

The left won’t even spare elderly nuns. When the Trump administration ended Barack Obama’s legal campaign against the Little Sisters of the Poor, various Democratic attorneys general made a point of continuing that unholy effort.

The Rise of Post-Liberal Christianity

This should not surprise us. Jesus promised that the powers of this world would hate his followers, not that they would love us if we were virtuous. While we Christians should always strive to be more like Christ, we should not succumb to a quasi-Pelagianism that presumes our winsomeness determines how others receive the gospel. Christ himself was crucified, and the grace and charity many martyrs exemplified did not save them from persecution unto death.

But that we should expect trouble in this world does not mean we should be disinterested regarding politics, nor does it excuse governments that oppose the church and oppress its people. That our nation seems to be starting down this path has intensified Christian reconsiderations of liberal political theory. Although our government ostensibly protects the freedoms of religion, association, and speech, procedural liberalism increasingly appears insufficient to protect our rights or to ensure a culture of tolerance and pluralism that includes Christians who maintain the traditional teachings of our faith.

The supposedly neutral principles of the legal left consistently restrict the rights and opportunities of orthodox Christians, and the left always pushes the envelope. Christian litigators should, of course, do their best to defend our rights, and thank God for their efforts, but it should be no surprise that more and more Christians are intrigued by varieties of post-liberal thinking, including previously marginalized ideas such as Catholic integralism. It is understandable that Christians are turning against the system of liberal democratic capitalism as it turns against them.

Post-liberal Christians are unlikely to find their minority status daunting, for they see that minorities can win if they are determined and the institutions they face are weak and full of cowards. After all, a minority of hard-line leftists control cultural, economic, and political pressure points that grant them power far beyond their numbers.

For example, the 2020 Democratic field is so radically pro-abortion that even The New York Times has noticed. The Democratic Party stands for abortion today, abortion tomorrow, and abortion forever, as Sen. Elizabeth Warren illustrated in promising that at her inauguration — angels and ministers of grace defend us! — she will wear swag to rep the nation’s largest abortion chain.

Christian post-liberals on the right have seen how readily the liberal center-left and the Chamber-of-Commerce right surrender to the extreme and illiberal left and wonder: Why not us? A decadent and despairing culture with weak institutions and degraded elites is precisely the sort that a determined minority might govern.

Thus, they see an opportunity as our culture disintegrates despite its wealth and technological prowess. Liberal individualism seems to be devouring itself: Fertility is down, loneliness and depression have increased, and deaths of despair from suicide, drugs, and alcohol are way up.

Should Liberalism Be Preserved?

Perhaps it is time to be bold and reorder society toward the highest good, rather than accepting liberalism’s dishonest promises of “live and let live” neutrality. As some post-liberal thinkers note, we increasingly live in a non-Christian integralist society that mandates belief in sectarian dogmas, such as the mystical belief that a man may become — indeed, may already be — a woman. Therefore, they see the alternative to post-liberal Christian politics not as liberalism, but as some sort of post-Christian illiberal politics.

I am sympathetic to some of the post-liberal thought developing on the right. I see the appeal, especially as liberalism’s promise of legal neutrality is exposed as so much fiction. I share many of the critiques of liberal political theory and find its discourse far more interesting than the stale talking points of neoliberals and neoconservatives.

But I am neither Catholic nor Calvinist enough to be much of an integralist, and I remain more skeptical of the likelihood of governmental efficacy and rectitude than many post-liberals seem to be. I also remain attached to many liberal practices, such as the right to trial by jury.

I am, in short, still thinking over these matters and am not entirely in either camp. From this in-between, I would recommend post-liberal thinkers reflect on the frailty and fallibility of human institutions. I also suggest that the defenders of liberal democratic capitalism take the critiques of post-liberals seriously. A liberal order that seeks to shut down Christian charities for nonconformist views on human sexuality does not deserve to survive.

"No, Website Updates Don't Mean Trump Is Trying To 'Erase' LGBT People","“Yet again, the Trump-Pence administration is attempting to erase LGBTQ people from federal programs and protections. Our message is this: You cannot erase us,” the Human Rights Campaign tweeted Jan. 2.

The tweet linked to an NBC News story titled, “Trump trend: LGBTQ mentions quietly axed from discrimination guidelines,” which stated, “The Trump administration has quietly but systematically removed mentions of ‘sexual orientation’ and ‘gender identity’ from executive branch guidelines on discrimination.” Citing a Huffington Post story, the article asserted, “The removal was just the latest in a nearly three-year-long effort to strip mention of LGBTQ people from the executive branch bureaucracy.”

As has become common in left-wing thinking and LGBT advocacy, these articles imply a lack of recognition equals open rejection. Failing to adequately praise leftist LGBT achievement appears to them as hostility and opposition.

The Trump administration was burdened from the start by an obsessive media claim that Trump was openly anti-LGBT. This prejudice validated itself by hyping LGBT pages “erased” from government websites immediately after his inauguration. In reality, Trump’s actions reveal the administration’s focus on large-scale national concerns rather than micromanaging identity groups or social issues. Rather than erasing LGBT people, the administration signaled an end to LGBT-focused legislation, instead assuming equality and normalcy.

People: Donald Trump Isn’t Anti-LGBT

Unfortunately, LGBT advocacy seems fixated on public validation over quiet integration and insists on a segregated platform in which to display leftist social and legal achievements. President Trump failing to openly acknowledge LGBT politics supposedly signaled the beginning of hostility now that he was in power, despite no evidence to support such an assertion.

Trump has appointed five openly LGBT ambassadors and U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Patrick Bumatay. Vice President Mike Pence met with the openly gay Irish prime minister and his partner and publicly praised openly gay Olympic athletes amid controversy over his perceived anti-LGBT views. Trump honored hero police officer and openly gay Crystal Griner with the Medal of Honor after her bravery in saving Rep. Steve Scalise and other Republican members of Congress during an attempted assassination.

So where has this mythology of Trump “erasing” LGBT people come from, and why has it sustained itself? On Jan. 25, 2017, LGBTQ Nation reported in a story titled, “Trump White House starts scrubbing LGBTQ pages from State Department website,” that all mention of LGBT issues and related content had been removed from the White House website. It quoted Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, saying, “It is outrageous that the new administration would attempt to erase from the record this historic apology for witch hunts that destroyed the lives of innocent Americans.”

But as The New York Times reported regarding all Obama-era priorities, such as climate change, “The purge was not unexpected. It came as part of the full digital turnover of whitehouse.gov, including taking down and archiving all the Obama administration’s personal and policy pages.” All information from the previous administration was transferred to an archive, as has been the norm. There was never a controversy to begin with.

The Trump Administration Isn’t Erasing LGBT People

In the same way, the newest outrage is nothing but either a misunderstanding or intentional deception. The “erasure” of LGBT from discrimination guidelines is connected to the 2017 Ethics Guide for Department of the Interior Employees, which states, “You shall adhere to all laws and regulations that provide equal opportunities for all Americans regardless of race, color, religion, sex, age, or handicap.” This differed from the 2009 Obama administration’s guidelines, which included “gender” and “sexual orientation” but not “sex” listed in the restriction.

Department of Interior spokeswoman Carol Danko, however, told the Huffington Post that the change was in compliance with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s interpretation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Danko explained, “Per the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, under Title VII, the term ‘sex’ includes gender, gender identity, transgender status, sexual orientation, and pregnancy.”

Danko, accusing the Huffington Post of attempting to create controversy where none existed, stating, “Under Secretary [David] Bernhardt’s leadership, the Interior Department has a zero tolerance policy for discrimination or harassment of any kind.”

Despite acknowledging the change would in no way affect the legal rights of LGBT federal employees who were covered under the discrimination policy, Robin Maril, associate legal director at the Human Rights Campaign, argued, “Removing these protections sends a dangerous signal to workers and supervisors that non-discrimination protections are no longer a priority.” LGBT advocacy organizations have published no reports of anti-LGBT discrimination.

Donald Trump Is Refusing to Virtue-Signal

Even more absurd is the fact that the LGBT left went to the Supreme Court to ensure that “sex” under Title VII be redefined to include sexual orientation and gender identity, as they believed LGBT people were left unprotected. So why the outrage when Trump administration officials honored this language change? In our current political environment, whatever the Trump administration does or does not do is viewed as malicious. It seems no amount of reasoning will change this obsessive view.

It has become vital to the movement itself that LGBT people be under constant attack from the president and his officials. They appear incapable of functioning without sounding the alarm that the administration is targeting them. Yet year after year, accusation after accusation, the president and his administration continue to approach LGBT people as equals and simply refuse to engage in the dehumanizing practice of identity-prioritized politics.

If Trump were truly struggling to contain his hatred for gay and trans people, you could imagine he would have acted out in actual hostility toward them by now. LGBT media and advocacy certainly have given him plenty of reason to do so.

One major distinction between President Barack Obama and Trump is that the latter does not seem to need the highly segmented approval of hundreds of grievance groups in order to feel he is doing a good job. For the right, this represents a more equal-opportunity leader who focuses on issues and not virtue signaling. For the left, it seems to indicate deep and intentional disregard for the well-being of groups they believe deserve special acknowledgement.

As a gay person, I prefer the right’s view on this. If what Trump’s administration is doing is “erasing” LGBT people, then being erased must be the same thing as equality and assimilation — and that looks like progress to me.

LGBT Activists Shouldn't Push Grindr App Complicit In Gruesome Murder,"Warning: This article contains graphic content that may be disturbing to some readers.

On Christmas day, the family of a 25-year-old gay man reported him missing after he left the night prior to meet a stranger he talked with on the gay hook-up app Grindr. Police soon discovered his body, mutilated, hanging from the rafters of a Michigan farmhouse owned by 50-year-old Mark Latunski, who confessed to the murder. The young man’s story gained media attention due to his name, Kevin Bacon, and his fascination with beauty icon Jeffree Star, whom Bacon had several tattoos honoring.

Before the details of the gruesome murder became public, Star made a public statement regarding the murder. Star even generously donated $20,000 to the family for funeral expenses. Bacon was a college student and hair stylist, and he did what millions of young gay men do regularly: He chatted with someone who sparked his interest and agreed to meet him for sex.

According to the Washington Post, Latunski was known for his bondage fetish, and several other men had fled during their encounters with him due to his threatening behavior. Bacon was not as fortunate, as Latunski confessed to stabbing him in the back then slicing his throat. At some unknown point, he hung Bacon upside down by his ankles from the rafters and cut off the man’s testicles. He then cooked and ate them. With his long criminal history and mental health concerns going back decades, prosecutors have yet to determine how they will proceed.

Apps Like Grindr Cause a Multitude of Problems

A report titled, “A Crisis of Hate: A Report on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Hate Violence Homicides in 2017,” organized by the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, indicated that 45 percent of gay male murder victims in 2017 were the result of online hook-ups. It is not always clear when the cases involve gay killers or when homophobic predators use apps such as Grindr. In 2018, for example, four men aged 19 to 21 used Grindr to persuade gay men to give their home addresses and then proceeded to assault and rob the victims.

Grindr is an app that allows anyone to sign up, create a profile, and see any other online user who is geographically close to them. Used mostly by gay men, it has become synonymous with gay male culture. The app has 3 million daily users, and despite its popularity, a study of 200,000 iPhone users found 77 percent of Grindr users felt regret after encounters.

In 2018, a gay psychologist, concerned about gay men’s mental health in using the app, conducted a study. He said, “The users I interviewed told me that when they closed their phones and reflected on the shallow conversations and sexually explicit pictures they sent, they felt more depressed, more anxious, and even more isolated. Some experience overwhelming guilt following a sexual encounter in which no words are spoken. After the orgasm, the partner may walk out the door with little more than a ‘thanks.’” Estimates show upwards of 50 percent of gay men suffer from depression, and since 2007, gay men are more likely to die from suicide than HIV.

More disturbing is a study from the Journal of Adolescent Health that found more than half of sexually active 14- to 17-year-old gay and bisexual males use apps such as Grindr for hook-ups. Grindr, like all gay hook-up apps and websites, requires users to be 18 years old or older, but minors can easily bypass these restrictions. While Grindr has stated it does not condone illegal use of the app, it only requires users to enter a birth date and year to use.

LGBT Advocates Encourage Teens to Use Grindr

Despite the high risks involved and the illegal behavior, including the sharing of child pornography and sexual assault of minors by adult men, LGBT advocates have championed the use of the app for teenagers. Logo, an LGBT media network, published a study of use by teenage boys, saying, “Despite its age restrictions, the LGBT hookup app could be helping gay and bi teen boys come out and find community.”

A professor at Northwestern University argued, “We found that teens in this study were super excited that somebody was paying attention with what was going on in their lives, and how these apps played a role in their sexual development and coming-out process.” The LGBT advocacy organization concluded its study by stating, “Researchers believe that the app’s functionalities might appeal to closeted or newly out teens, who might be navigating same-sex dating or sexual relationships for the first time.”

As prior investigations show, an extremely high number of adult men feel regret after using the app, and studies indicate repeat daily usage is similar to cocaine or heroin use. The study indicated, “[W]hen a neutral action (clicking on Grindr) is paired with a pleasurable response in the brain (orgasm), humans learn to do that action over and over again.” Why would LGBT advocates believe usage of the app, even without considering the significant illegal activity and abuses involved, would be positive for emotionally and physically vulnerable minds in discovering their identity?

Parents Must Protect Teens. LGBT Activists Certainly Won’t

It all comes down to priorities. While LGBT advocates focus on hate crimes, discrimination, or other outside negative influences on the LGBT community, they fail to see the dangers within it. Extreme crimes such as the one Bacon suffered are rare, but without any security measures within the apps or the LGBT media response, those crimes become more likely to occur again. With boys as young as 14 using the app without parental knowledge, encouraged by LGBT advocates, the consequences of these dangers become even more profound.

Do parents realize that teenage boys, using only their phones, can sexually advertise themselves to any adult man several miles around them and find themselves alone in a stranger’s house before the parents even know their boys are gone? Do parents know that LGBT advocates are encouraging this behavior under the guise of it being a positive way for teenage boys to explore their sexuality? Do teens and their parents know the dangers involved?

Tragedies such as Bacon’s are not merely moments to pause and consider the consequences in risky adult behavior. They give us moral reason to protect the most vulnerable exposed to these risks. While adults can protect themselves in many ways, they must protect teenagers too. It’s clear the LGBT community has no interest in doing so.

Perhaps this unthinkable crime can be the final straw for lawmakers nationwide to hold companies such as Grindr accountable, but more importantly, to hold accountable the adult men exploiting teenage boys who have no way of understanding the danger they are putting themselves in and the LGBT organizations encouraging those boys.

Gay Activist Dies By Suicide After LGBT Mob Rips Him For Drag Protest,"A young man ends his own life, and hundreds of people cheer and laugh, confident in their assessment that he was a bad person and therefore, the world is better without him. It seems the internet has created a generation wherein cruel comments and self-righteous indignation are as freely posted and forgotten as emojis in a text. But these words last forever, and they show us the world in which we live. Cruelty as social justice? The leaders of the left stay silent.

The day before Wilson Gavin, a 21-year-old gay conservative student, took his life, he was leading a protest of a Drag Queen Story Hour hosted by a drag queen named Diamond Good-Rim at the Brisbane Square Library in Australia. A group of about 15 students interrupted the event, chanting, “Drag Queens are not for kids!” Jess Origliasso, half of the singing group The Veronicas, quickly posted a video of the event on her Instagram, shouting her outrage about the protests to her 319,000 followers.

Soon after, the Liberal National Party, to which Gavin and his group belonged, denounced the demonstration, saying, “The small group of people involved in this completely inappropriate display do not in any way represent how we as a council and the LNP feels, and it will not and never will be tolerated. They are not a part of the LNP.” As many LGBT media outlets described, Gavin faced nationwide condemnation and intense bullying and harassment online for taking a stand.

The LGBT Mob Doesn’t Really Care About Bullying

It is difficult to imagine the weight Gavin carried, with nowhere to turn while the full force of the LGBT media raged against him. Some people on the right who have risked standing up to the left know exactly how intimidating and frightening it can be. Seeing your name, your face, and your reputation distorted into a caricature over which you have no control is something no one is prepared for. The cruelty and determination of the LGBT mob is unlike anything else one can experience.

In his death, LGBT media headlines say, “Gay right-winger who protested drag queens & marriage equality died by suicide,” and the comments on Facebook are filled with mocking, smug dismissals of his humanity sprinkled with laments of his “self-hatred.” The LGBT mob and media simply cannot see that they are the source of hatred and bullying. The movement has built this toxic culture of political dissent.

Despite its calls for ending online bullying and protecting LGBT youth, the Human Rights Campaign likely will not honor Gavin or remember him as a bullied and harassed young activist. His suicide is unlikely to be a catalyst for discussing depression and anxiety in the LGBT community, and the reality that the LGBT world came crashing down on him for the act of standing up for the innocence of children will be lost on them.

Russell Blackford, a lecturer at the University of Newcastle, speaking of the backlash Gavin received, recognized that the demonstration deserved criticism but that the outrage was out of proportion. He argued, “The feeling that this is how you do activism — by destroying someone — doesn’t sit well. And it happens on both sides of the political spectrum, it should be said.” He said redemption or even the opportunity to defend yourself has become impossible, as the speed of outrage increases and people with remarkable social power abuse it for temporary gratification. This has become sadly and deeply true.

Life Matters More than Winning a Culture War Fight

Fighting for what you believe isn’t easy, and those of us who fight for the lives of the unborn, the rights we see steadily chiseled away, and for the simple ability to practice one’s religion in peace know this all too well. Over time, the rage and insults lose their force.

Although Gavin had been advocating for conservative views in Australia since he was 19 years old, he may not have had time to build up the strength to withstand the left’s wrath. At 21, he barely knew who he was as a person, let alone as an activist. The hatred he felt from his own community may have simply been too intense and too strong to battle.

What we can do as a community of reason and compassion is to recognize that regardless of how confident they appear to be, the targets of bullying and outrage campaigns are vulnerable and isolated. We have the ability to prop each other up, stand up for good people, and make sure no one is piled on until he can no longer breathe. Most importantly, we must remember that while our culture war fights matter, our lives matter far more. Family, friendship, and faith keep us afloat, and we can each offer these things in our own community.

The right has the ability to stand up to the outrage mob by refusing to back down on issues they deem forbidden. Gavin defended those standing up for traditional marriage and then, a few years later, recognized drag queen events were inappropriate for children and stood up against them. To view only the left’s response to Gavin might lead one to assume his positions were so socially taboo as to deserve universal public shaming. Why must we allow the left to so aggressively intimidate and shout down the most moderate and responsible of political positions?

The young are brave and reckless, and we have a responsibility to stand around them, let them make their own mistakes, and help them stand back up. I hope Wilson Gavin had the love and friendship I rely on every day, and I pray for his friends and family during this profoundly devastating time.

Beyond politics, we are all people with real lives bigger than social media and the LGBT mob. As long as we remember this, hatred cannot take a foothold. Fighting for what is right matters, but so does kindness and community. Remember Wilson Gavin, and remember what he was fighting for.

Gay Activists Attack ‘Homophobic’ Black Minister’s MLK Day Sermon,"Determined to portray Vice President Mike Pence as a dedicated homophobic threat to LGBT Americans, media pounced on the opportunity when, after Pence gave a speech reflecting on Martin Luther King Jr. at Holy City Church of God In Christ in Tennessee, the pastor discussed homosexuality in part of his sermon. NBC News titled its article, “Pence attends homophobic sermon streamed on White House YouTube channel,” whereas Business Insider lamented, “Mike Pence spoke at a homophobic church service where the pastor blamed ‘the devil’ for same-sex attraction.”

The event was dedicated to the memory of Martin Luther King Jr., held with the majority-black congregation, led by Bishop Jerry W. Taylor. Pence spoke of King, saying, “I know in my heart of hearts, if we rededicate ourselves to the ideals that he advanced, if we strive to open doors of opportunities for every American and if we more faithfully follow the one that he followed, will see our way through these divided times.” As the bishop moved into his sermon, he focused on the crumbling foundation of the family.

In the full two-hour stream from the White House’s YouTube channel, Taylor’s comments on homosexuality occur in the last 30 minutes, alongside condemnation of abortion. “We have to encourage young men and women to get married,” he said. “It’s a demonic spirit that causes a woman to want to lie with another woman. It’s a demonic spirit that causes a man to be attracted to another man.”

“Wish we could say we were surprised that the vice president spoke at a church event where the bishop spouted vile things about LGBTQ people,” LGBT activist group GLAAD responded. “But here we are.” The LGBT organization added this event to its list of Trump administration “attacks” on LGBT people.

The Human Rights Campaign’s Charlotte Clymer also lamented that the vice president’s appearance at Sunday’s event was another example of Pence using his “perception of faith as a cudgel against vulnerable communities.” Clymer argued, “Christ clearly taught us to love one another.” The White House has not yet commented on the controversy.

Churches Don’t Have to Conform to LGBT Messaging

There is no indication the vice president knew of the sermon’s content beforehand, but it remains an important question of whether he should have chosen not to participate in the overwhelmingly positive event if he had. It is simply uncontroversial that a great many traditional Christians view homosexuality exactly as it is described in the Bible. It does not indicate they discriminate against gay men and women nor even view us negatively as people. But despite the ongoing outrage expressed by LGBT leaders and the media, their religious view remains.

It is striking that the media refer to this church, which began in the home of the bishop in 1987 and is a popular church for members of the black community in the area, as “homophobic,” as though it were dedicated to anti-LGBT messaging. It could just as easily have been referred to as the “anti-choice” church for the bishop’s opposition to abortion. The fact that the religious congregation views secular issues from a religious perspective does not, in any way, make them “hateful” or “anti.”

Yet the media portrays the vice president as though he chose the church because of its anti-LGBT messaging. His words on unity, love, and community were entirely ignored because journalists overreacted to hearing theology about sexuality they found offensive. The vice president is no more responsible for the bishop’s sermon than he would have been on any other occasion, yet the LGBT left feels entitled to demand he disavow a congregation over sentiments the mob finds unacceptable.

Truth be told, as a gay man, I do not care what the vice president, or anybody for that matter, thinks about homosexuality, especially from a religious perspective I do not hold. Clymer’s insistence that the event perpetuates stereotypes of intolerance within the Christian church is even more astounding. How is a religion supposed to function when it is expected to edit itself for the satisfaction of individuals and communities who do not wish to belong to it? Why do they care so very much?

Something I greatly admire about Pence is his disregard for others’ opinions about his faith. When he walked into that congregation, he saw men and women of faith and gave a moving speech on the legacy of a civil rights icon who devoted his life to spreading a message of hope, unity, and compassion. The values of family, the Bible, and sexual morality are neither relevant nor damning in this situation. As observers, it is not our role to condemn Christians in their own house of worship.

The LGBT Community Tramples Diversity of Opinion

Many in the LGBT community tend to require others to express absolute acceptance and celebration of their narrow view of themselves. They choose to perceive disagreement as “attacks” and judge others for seeing the world differently. Rather than take the time to put aside politics and join together to share King’s message, they reduced a service to a few mere sentences they could exploit for headlines and outrage. The media simply refuse to allow harmony among people with divergent views.

One part of the event not highlighted or quoted in media stands out. One of the passionate speakers who introduced Pence, praising his humility as a brother, said, “One thing I love about this man of God is, if you don’t know, he is one of the most persecuted Christians in America. The biggest criticism that he gets all over television and everywhere else is that he actually believes the Bible. … They hate him for believing the Bible.”

He spoke of meeting Pence and his wife and how they prayed together. He praised him for holding a weekly Bible study in his home. He continued, “But as the vice president of the United States, he came here as a brother in Christ. He didn’t come here to campaign, he said he just wanted to come to worship and celebrate my hero, Martin Luther King Jr.”

Rather than continuously look for the bad in others to validate their prejudices, it is my hope that the left and especially LGBT Americans can evolve to see the whole of a person rather than just clips here and there. Pence has been remarkably gracious, patient, and consistent in his engagements across the spectrum during his time as vice president, and he does not deserve the constant judgement on his assumed personal beliefs.

Taylor is also praised as a passionate leader uniting his community and creating a better world. He too does not deserve to be reduced to a caricature of how the left views Bible-believing Christians.

2020 Guide To State Bills To Protect Kids From Transgender Exploitation,"A number of important measures have been introduced nationwide to protect children from the reckless implementation of gender identity concepts ranging from school privacy to health care. While LGBT and transgender groups have sounded the alarm that Republicans are “attacking transgender youth,” these measures are responsible and moderate.

It is vital that Americans support and promote these efforts, state by state, to ensure children have the opportunity to stay children as long as possible and decide for themselves who they want to be when they are ready as adults.

Ensuring Athletics Remain Fair

For several years, athletics have struggled with how to maintain a fair playing field with biological males competing against girls under the argument they are equally female. Despite LGBT advocates insisting transgender athletes pose no disadvantages for women, female athletes, parents, and equality advocates have been demanding fairness.

Several states have introduced legislation that will protect student athletics from gender politics. These bills will specifically prohibit public schools from sponsoring or participating in athletic events in which students are required to compete against members of the opposite sex unless both sexes participate.

Chase Strangio, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, who is transgender, argues these laws are merely reactionary, like state efforts to restrict public restroom access to biology rather than identity. However, the argument from GOP leaders is simply one of fairness. Last year two biological male students who identify as female dominated high school girls’ track championships in Connecticut, leading female athletes and their parents to observe their participation is an unfair advantage.

State Rep. Chris Pringle (R) of Alabama introduced HB20. The measure will be heard in the Alabama House on 02/04/2020.

Georgia state Rep. Philip Singleton (R) introduced HB747, titled the Student Athlete Protection Act.

Missouri state Rep. Robert Ross (R) introduced HJR82, which proposes a constitutional amendment to protect the integrity of interscholastic athletic contests. Was read for the second time on 01/09/2020.

Missouri state Rep. Cindy O’Laughlin (R) introduced SJR50, which requires “students participating in any single-gender event or activity organized by a statewide activity association to participate in the event corresponding to the student’s biological sex.” Read for the first time on 01/08/2020.

State Sens. Bob Giuda (R), Regina Birdsell (R), and Ruth Ward (R) of New Hampshire introduced SB480 on 01/08/2020.

State Reps. Bruce Griffey (R) and Coach Byrd (R) of Tennessee introduced HB1572. As of 01/15/2020 the bill is in committee.

State Reps. Brad Klippert (R), Dan Griffey (R), and Jesse Young (R) of Washington introduced HB2201, in committee as of 01/13/2020.

West Virginia state Sen. Sue Cline (R) introduced SB296, in committee as of 01/10/2020.

Protecting the Privacy of Students in Schools

An ongoing controversy involving students using the restroom or locker room of the opposite sex has concerned parents, students, and conservative and feminist advocates alike. The most famous case of this is Gavin Grimm, a female student who identified as male. Grimm’s case went all the way to the Supreme Court in 2017 before being referred back to lower courts.

Grimm’s Virginia high school prohibited the student from using the boys’ restroom, and Grimm argued this violated the student’s civil rights. Concerns, primarily surrounding the privacy and safety of female students exposed to anatomically male students, have been heard by several state legislators.

Arizona state Rep. John Fillmore (R) introduced HB2082, which lays the foundation of privacy legislation by prohibiting school officials from being required to use a student’s preferred pronoun.

State Reps. David Hale (R), Myron Dossett (R), Robert Goforth (R), Kim King (R), Melinda Prunty (R), Sal Santoro (R), Jim Stewart III (R), and Ken Upchurch (R) of Kentucky introduced HB132, in committee as of 01/07/2020.

Massachusetts state Reps. Colleen Garry (D) and Joe McKenna (R) separately introduced H1427 and H1504. Both bills restrict lawfully sex-segregated spaces to members of the associated biological sex, including school restrooms and locker rooms. Both bills are scheduled for committee on 01/22/2020.

In 2019, Tennessee, Republicans passed SB1297 and HB1151, both signed into law, which restrict all lawfully sex-segregated spaces to members of the associated biological sex.

Banning Transgender Medical Intervention in Minors

Of all the issues surrounding the safety and wellbeing of minors, medically approved efforts to interfere with a child’s natural development with the use of puberty blockers with hormone treatment and plastic surgery in older minors is the most concerning. Despite official medical organizations endorsing the use of puberty blockers to treat gender dysphoria in children, conservative, feminist, and children’s advocates continue to challenge the status quo. Many state legislators have realized the only solution is to legally ban the practice altogether at the state level.

These laws each act to prevent specific medical procedures from being conducted, with legal and criminal penalties. Essentially the bills, individually and together, focus on the use of elective medical treatment options on minors for the purpose of stopping puberty or mimicking the opposite sex.

Children are routinely prescribed hormone blockers as a “pause” on physical development until they reach their teenage years, where they are placed on cross-sex hormones and undergo elective cosmetic surgeries like double mastectomies. These medical procedures are largely permanent and can sterilize the minor. A full reading on the negative effects of these procedures can be found in Ryan T. Anderson’s illuminating book, “When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment.”

Florida state Sen. Dennis Baxley (R) and state Reps. Anthony Sabatini (R), Jason Shoaf (R), Mike Hill (R), and Stanley McClain (R) have introduced companion bills S1864 and H1365, titled Vulnerable Child Protection Act and introduced on 01/14/2020.

Illinois state Rep. Tom Morrison (R) introduced HB3515 titled, Youth Health Protection Act. In committee as of 03/29/2019.

Missouri state Rep. Adam Schnelting (R) introduced HB1721 on 01/08/2020.

Missoui state Rep. Suzie Pollock (R) introduced HB2051, which adds an additional penalty that a “person commits the offense of abuse or neglect of a child if such person assists, coerces, or provides for a child to undergo any surgical or hormonal treatment for the purpose of gender reassignment.” Associated bills are state Sen. Bill Eigel’s (R) SB848 and state Sen. Ed Emery’s (R) SB842.

New Hampshire state Rep. Dave Testerman (R) introduced HB163, defining elective transgender medical intervention in minors as “child abuse.”

South Carolina state Reps. Stew Jones (R) and Garry Smith (R) introduced H4716. In committee as of 01/14/2020. An associated bill is HB1057, introduced on 01/17/2020 and sponsored by 43 Republican state representatives.

Each one of these legal efforts function as the foundation for wider legal change, so they are vital for not only the citizens of their respective states, but for concerned and responsible citizens everywhere. These efforts must be passionately supported by conservatives across the nation to be successful.

Each bill provides contact information for its sponsors, and direct advocacy and support is powerful. Rather than relying on the courts to enforce or block activities or hoping for the federal branches to act, state legislation is the most direct representation of the people.

The media representation of each of these bills will most likely be negatively positioned as “anti-LGBT” and harmful for transgender children. LGBTQ Nation, for example, described bills designed to ban elective transgender medical intervention as, “Some of the bills go as far as making it a felony to provide health care to a transgender child.”

The battle will be difficult, but these efforts represent a vital purpose for our generation to protect minors from leftwing social experimentation. We have an obligation to promote, defend, and ensure these legislative measures get passed and signed into law. Those brave enough to sponsor these important efforts should be recognized and appreciated for the good they are doing.

‘Equality’ Act Would Be A Big Nudge Towards A U.S. Social Credit System,"Over the past decade, China has developed a means of extorting conformity and compliance by ranking and sorting its 1.3 billion citizens into two main categories: the compliant, who are materially and socially rewarded, versus the less conforming, who are materially and socially punished.

Social control is the obvious aim of China’s social credit system. If the state says you “loitered” in some public place, you lose points. That could mean losing access to good housing, employment, transportation, and more.

In 2020, China plans for the system to go fully operational with scores on every citizen. The Chinese state monitors virtually all aspects of life—shopping habits, movements, daily routines, health, debt, love life, etc.—to enforce compliance with standards of behavior. China’s vast surveillance network includes hundreds of millions of cameras with facial recognition technologies enabling this scale of social control.

Algorithms score people and dole out consequences. In 2018, for example, China’s Global Times proudly reported that its social credit system had blocked more than 11.14 million flights and 4.25 million train trips of people who were behind in their debts. The idea, according to China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), is to make sure that “discredited people become bankrupt.”

Could it happen here? Several commentators have speculated that China’s Orwellian system might develop in America, especially given the Big Brother spirit of Big Tech. Americans are also becoming conditioned to sharing personal data online and being tracked through devices. In Human Events, writer Bradley Brewer contends that we already have a similar system of “technologically-mediated social control and coercion” in America. It is not top-down as is China’s, but de-centralized and controlled by “a loud virulent minority.”

For example, Google hired the Southern Poverty Law Center to censor YouTube videos on the pretext of banning hate speech. This gave the disproportionately powerful SPLC enormous clout to de-platform all people and organizations with whom it disagrees.

Then there is the growth of “woke” companies who make common cause with leftist lobbies to enforce politically correct group think. In early 2019 several conservative activists had their bank accounts inexplicably cancelled by Chase Bank. Several banks, including Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America have caved to agitators for open borders by cutting ties with companies that provide services to prisoner and immigrant detention centers. We recently saw Chick-Fil-A cave to the LGBT lobby by cutting its donations to the Salvation Army and other Christian organizations. The list goes on.

Equality Act Lays Groundwork by Dictating Reality

This leads to the next question: Is there any means by which a social credit system might become centralized in the United States? The First Amendment remains a sticking point. But one key may lie in the possibility of Congress enacting the so-called Equality Act.

If we want to preserve free expression, we need to understand two things deeply embedded in the nature of a free society. First off, there can be no free society if the government coerces people to conform to an idea generally viewed as farfetched. That’s like dictating reality, a hallmark of totalitarian systems. Second, any law that threatens social and material punishment for such non-conformity of thought lays the groundwork for a social credit system.

The “Equality” Act, which the House of Representatives passed in May and is now before the Senate, would be just such a law. In a nutshell, it tells all Americans that they must reject the reality of sex distinctions if they are to avoid social and material punishment. It does so under the pretext of adding sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) as categories to be protected against discrimination. And it applies to every aspect of life, including housing, employment, transportation, education, businesses, and more.

U.K. Forstater Case Gives a Template

In the United Kingdom, freedom of speech and conscience under its own Equality Act of 2010 was recently put to the test. In December, Maya Forstater, a British tax expert, was fired from a think tank, the Center for Global Development, for publicly stating her view that there are two sexes, male and female, and for tweeting that changing the legal definition of women to include men undermines women’s rights.

Forstater challenged her employer in court, and in December the judge ruled against her. Forstater’s acknowledgement of physical sex distinctions were found to be in conflict with the UK’s Equality Act and, according to the judge, “not worthy of respect in a democratic society.”

Enter British citizen J.K. Rowling, the phenomenally successful author of the Harry Potter series with more than 14 million Twitter followers. She immediately tweeted her disagreement with the ruling:

Dress however you please.

Call yourself whatever you like.

Sleep with any consenting adult who’ll have you.

Live your best life in peace and security.

But force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real? #IStandWithMaya #ThisIsNotADrill — J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) December 19, 2019

As of this writing, Rowling has not recanted to the trans-woke mob. But she continues to be raked over the coals for her mild question, “But force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real?” Public statements and essays accusing her of transphobia abound. Unlike Forstater, the independently wealthy Rowling has not been punished for her apparent apostasy through heavy fines or firings. But the time for material punishment of such statements, even for someone of Rowling’s stature, may be just around the corner.

On the local level in the United States, we already see similar examples. In New York City there is a maximum $250,000 fine for misgendering someone, and there are several cases of bakers and florists with politically incorrect beliefs about sex distinctions and marriage who have been denied their livelihoods by state governments.

Indeed, government control over commerce to this extent allows the state to coopt companies in their effort to police speech and thought. Many of these companies cooperate with the government out of fear as well as legal necessity. This is the essence of how a social credit system operates, and it indicates how astray the concept of “democratic society” has gone.

U.S. ‘Equality Act’ Would Affect Society in Numerous Ways

Obviously, America is not China and the Equality Act is not a social credit system. But reading the text of the Equality Act, House Resolution 5, it suggests some early similarities.

The Equality Act builds on most of the elements needed to establish something very much like China’s social credit system. It undermines individual freedom of expression. It extends government direction and control over speech. And it provides for government and private punishment, both material and social, on citizens who don’t comply.

Below are just a few of the ways the Equality Act aims to enforce conformity of thought through threat of punishment.

If you do not adhere to gender ideology, it seems neither you nor your employer can do business without being threatened by the state.

The Equality Act un-defines “sex.” It adds to civil rights laws (especially the Civil Rights Act of 1964) the categories of sexual orientation and gender identity to race, color, religion, and national origin. But it does so by redefining the term “sex” to include those SOGI categories of sexual orientation and gender identity.

The language abolishes the intrinsic meaning of the word “sex,” so that it no longer can mean the distinction between male and female. In other words, it is at war with biological reality and threatens to punish anyone who accepts that reality.

The Equality Act seems to expand the scope of the prohibition on discrimination in at least two ways. First, it defines an establishment “to include an individual whose operations affect commerce and who is a provider of a good, service, or program.” This would presumably mean any employee or volunteer who is in any way a part of an establishment. The list of public accommodations is lengthy, and includes everything from salons to women’s shelters to funeral parlors.

Second, it also expands the list of commercial activities covered in anti-discrimination law, to include pretty much everything, including “communication” (already covered in the Civil Rights Act) and “entertainment…public gathering, or public display” (newly added). So it looks like we have here an expansion of state control over individuals within establishments. If you do not adhere to gender ideology, it seems neither you nor your employer can do business without being threatened by the state.

The Equality Act also sets up a collision course between SOGI rights and the First Amendment. It would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) while the main law it amends, the Civil Rights Act, prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion. Therefore, conflict is guaranteed. But the SOGI side wins out over freedom of religion because the Equality Act expressly states that religious beliefs may not be a part of freedom of expression, particularly in defense against any accusation of SOGI discrimination.

The bill also specifically invalidates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) of 1993, which was intended to breathe new life into the First Amendment, stating that the RFRA “shall not provide a claim concerning, or a defense to a claim under, a covered title, or provide a basis for challenging the application or enforcement of a covered title.”

The Equality Act appears to explicitly promote and encourage wholesale lawsuits intended to destroy perceived enemies.

The Equality Act appears to explicitly promote and encourage wholesale lawsuits intended to destroy perceived enemies. The language states that nothing in it “shall be construed to limit the claims or remedies available to any individual for an unlawful practice” on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. This is an open invitation to put out of business anybody deemed undesirable by social engineers.

And how might an “unlawful practice” be construed in the future? If a business owner or landlord is known to attend a church with traditional teachings on sex and marriage, could that in itself be construed as discrimination?

The bill also encourages private surveillance and snitch culture. We already live in a highly polarized culture. If lawfare against such thought crime is encouraged, we can expect to see new depths of vindictiveness rewarded by the state and a further decline in social trust. People will feel pressure to show mandatory enthusiasm for ideas that we do not personally accept.

Consider, for example, the words of LGBT activist David Gushee , writing as an “evangelical ethicist” in a 2016 op-ed. He warned that there is no middle ground for anyone not on board with the full-scale LGBT agenda: “Neutrality is not an option. . . . Hide as you might, the issue will come and find you.” And he was talking about churches.

What’s Missing: Centralized Surveillance and Monitoring

Recall the key elements of the Chinese social credit system: government standards, proactive government enforcement of those standards, and the surveillance and monitoring infrastructure to enable enforcement. And let’s review what the Equality Act does: it expands the scope of government-established and mandated standards; reduces the scope of the private sphere; undermines freedom of belief and expression; increases the scope of government control over our private lives, including employment and religious practices and beliefs; and it undermines the First Amendment.

The Equality Act, if enacted into law, will move us down the path toward that social credit system, but not the whole way. At least two elements seem to be missing: a surveillance infrastructure and a centralized government database.

Of course, much of the surveillance infrastructure is already in place for a social credit system. There are millions of cameras embedded not just on street corners and public places, but in our cell phones and computers and inside our homes. Facial recognition software can be incorporated and in many cases already is.

All of the biggest data-mining operations—including Google, Facebook, Apple, Twitter, Amazon, and more—are on record as fully supporting the Equality Act.

Further, all of the biggest data-mining operations—including Google, Facebook, Apple, Twitter, Amazon, and more—are on record as fully supporting the Equality Act, despite all of the social engineering the act requires.

Support for the Equality Act is not the same as willingness to share data to determine compliance with it. But with a surveillance infrastructure pretty much in place and the Equality Act’s attack on freedom of expression, can we really trust Big Tech to resist any temptation to develop a central clearinghouse of data once the timing seems right?

In addition, U.S. governments have not quite yet proactively imposed their version of ideological correctness on citizens, preferring to wait for citizens to report violations to independent civil rights commissions. Of course, the Equality Act itself is proactive in that it will “nudge” citizens to behave “properly.” Beyond that, how long do we believe the government will exercise a measure of self-restraint, limiting its data collection and use, limiting its urge to tell us what to do, how to do it, when to do it, with whom to do it?

Imagine a federal law like New York City’s $250,000 fine for misgendering.

When you federalize thought policing, which is essentially what the Equality Act does, then it seems you are creating a social credit system that nationalizes the punishment of wrong think both materially and socially. Imagine a federal law like New York City’s $250,000 fine for misgendering. Imagine activist judges everywhere—not just in states and localities—eager to bankrupt anyone who doesn’t reject biological reality.

Consider also how identity politics also conditions us to accept a social credit system. Affirmative action seems to have morphed into the grievance theory of intersectionality. Intersectionality literally sets up a cultural scorecard by which perceived victims are awarded points and perceived oppressors lose points in society.

This elaborate social scoring system is well embedded on today’s college campuses, where students are being conditioned to “check their privilege.” In addition, any student who fakes a politically correct belief to avoid a bad grade is already mentally adjusted to a social credit system.

No, we are not China. No, the Equality Act does not translate directly into a social credit system. But it does represent a bait-and-switch power grab by the state. And unless we are cautious, it represents the extra bricks needed to pave an ever-shorter road to Hell.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/01/28/democrats-equality-act-would-be-a-big-nudge-towards-a-u-s-social-credit-system/,2020-01-28
7 U.K. Cities Cancel Franklin Graham For Crime Of Believing The Bible,"Evangelist Franklin Graham certainly fits the criteria for leftist outrage target. Not only has he notably defended President Trump, Graham also believes the Bible and wants to share it with the world.

It’s no surprise, then, that Graham has once again fallen victim to the intolerance of a leftist horde well-versed in silencing any voice with which they disagree. This time, it’s Britain’s Liverpool Labour LGBT Network leading the charge by pressuring its city’s local government to cancel Graham’s upcoming speaking engagement. Terrified of straying out of favor with those who can summon placards and protest, Liverpool’s ACC conference center duly agreed to pull the plug.

“Over the past few days we have been made aware of a number of statements which we consider to be incompatible with our values,” the conference center said, presumably after being presented with a quote from Graham on Islam or being informed of his opposition to homosexual acts. “In light of this we can no longer reconcile the balance between freedom of speech and the divisive impact this event is having in our city.” It added, “[T]he booking will no longer be fulfilled.”

Graham’s Sheffield tour stop was also canceled Wednesday, with the leader of the City Council, Julie Dore, calling the preacher’s views “discriminatory and repulsive.” Update: over the weekend, seven of the eight U.K. venues have now canceled Graham’s booking. The last one — in Newcastle — is looking shaky.

Graham Aligns with the Church of England on Marriage

Again, Graham falls foul of campaigners who are seemingly perturbed by his consistent advocacy of biblical marriage between one man and one woman for life. The Bible is outdated and tired, they say, and it is time to send it to the grave.

Notably, on this issue, Graham does not deviate from the party line adopted by the Church of England, still the largest and most influential denomination in the United Kingdom. Only recently, the church received a mild social media flogging, mainly at the hands of British millennials, for suggesting sex serves us best when kept exclusively within lifelong heterosexual marriage.

“For Christians, marriage — that is the lifelong union between a man and a woman, contracted with the making of vows — remains the proper context for sexual activity,” the church stated. The ensuing derision soon subsided, and somehow the Anglican tradition plods on without great resistance.

Let’s remember that the Church of England is singing from the same hymn sheet as Graham with regard to many other hot-button issues. For example, the Church of England declares a “strong opposition to abortion,” has repeatedly rejected same-sex marriage, and openly stamps its approval on the trustworthiness of the Bible. Graham would approve. Yet despite its officially adopted positions, Anglicans are free to frequently host events in “secular” conference venues without overt opposition.

Britain Doesn’t Like Graham’s Politics

So what does all this tell us? Despite the LGBT lobby’s insistence that it is an inclusive social movement, its protestations are clearly underpinned by a staunch political bias. As such, there is little doubt Graham’s tacit support of President Trump has everything to do with the particularly barbed statements accompanying these sudden cancellations.

It is also unsurprising that Britain’s increasingly hard-left political opposition, the Labour Party, was affiliated with the original protest petition against Graham’s presence at the ACC. This party is known for being wildly leftist on social issues, largely atheistic in nature, and for boasting the current mayor of London and grandstanding anti-Trumper Sadiq Khan within its political ranks.

It is now abundantly clear that public figures espousing any support for the U.S. president, including even Facebook posts urging people to pray for him, are no longer safe from haranguing when they arrive upon Britain’s shores. Arguably, this sad reality serves as a deep scourge upon our long-standing values as a nation and is symptomatic of our spineless handing over of core and enduring principles to a collective mob mentality with no regard for the right to free political or religious expression.

Indeed, the intolerant left threatens to eviscerate free speech and replace it with a niche subset of rules governing what is acceptable to say and believe. It is not hard, then, to see why so many fear we have arrived at a grave juncture in our civic society and political discourse. It is totalitarianism of a different kind, but it is totalitarianism nonetheless.

“We are proud to represent all communities,” the ACC insisted as it struck Graham from its booking sheet. Farcical. Of course it doesn’t represent all communities. The ACC simply caves to the group that shouts the loudest and is known for bankrupting businesses and ruining reputations. If the ACC really championed all people, it would allow Graham to occupy its stage for an evening.

Who Will Get Canceled Next?

Just how offensive can a brief gospel presentation really be? Staggeringly, I can imagine that, given our absurd modern-day vernacular, Graham’s call to the altar would be classed as a “microaggression.”

“It is said by some that I am coming to the UK to bring hateful speech to your community. This is just not true,” Graham said in response to the accusations leveled against him. “I am coming to share the gospel, which is the good news that God loves the people of the UK. … [T]he gospel is inclusive.”

Unfortunately, as we’ve seen on so many occasions, Graham’s words won’t be enough for many with social power to welcome him with open arms. Even if he apologized for scheduling the visit, repented of his wokelessness, defrocked himself, and admitted the whole Christianity thing was a sham, it would still not satisfy their bloodlust.

So the son of one of the most influential preachers in history is left both bewildered and rightly anxious for the future upholding of free speech in Britain. “If they oppose me, who’s next?” he asked in response to the cancellations. “Who are they going to silence?”

"No, David Hogg, LGBT People Did Not Start The Anti-Gun Movement","David Hogg, the anti-gun activist who attended Stoneman Douglas High School during the shooting in 2018, tweeted last week about “indigenous lgbtq women and non binary people” who he claims began the anti-gun movement he’s joined.

This is a tweet for for the founders of the gun violence prevention movement started centuries ago by almost entirely black, brown and indigenous lgbtq women and non binary people that never got on the news or in most history books. We may not know all your names but thank you. — David Hogg (@davidhogg111) January 27, 2020

As the national coordinator for the Pink Pistols, the largest U.S. pro-queer gun group that was founded under the principle “Armed queers don’t get bashed,” I found Hogg’s statement not just wrong, but completely careless in its inaccuracy, and therefore callous to the injustice done to those people whom he is claiming to champion.

Hogg speaks of “centuries of gun violence prevention.” I have no idea how he arrived at this number, and I doubt anyone else does, either. If there is a history book that tells the story of how non-white queer women and transwomen started a gun control movement in 1820, then I would very much like to read it.

I specify the year 1820 because Hogg’s use of the plural for century indicates a minimum of 200 years, and the United States will be only 244 years old this July 4. In the 44-year period between 1776 and 1820, our country was nearly always at war, including the Revolutionary War, the Franco-American Naval War, the Barbary Wars, the War of 1812, and the Creek War. During that time our nation still relied upon militias composed of volunteers with privately owned rifles and pistols. So restricting arms only to those citizens who belonged to a standing army would not only have severely hampered a fledgling America’s struggle for existence both on home soil and abroad, but gun control as we know it today would have been an alien concept to American colonists and early citizens.

At that time, the British East India Company — a private company answerable to stockholders, not an organ of the British government — had the largest armed force in the world, consisting of multiple armies with cavalry and artillery assets, as well as fleets of heavily armed merchantmen supplemented with warships. Furthermore, the Constitution of the United States includes a framework for Congress to write letters of marque and reprisal, which granted private citizens the ability to hunt ships of hostile nations for the good of the country. These private citizens did this with privately held warships armed with naval-scale cannons.

Given just these two examples, it is clear the highest levels of military hardware were available to private owners, and that small arms — including those suitable for military use — were therefore ubiquitous. So ubiquitous were they that states and municipalities would fine able-bodied men for not having weapons or participating in militia musters. There were even laws fining people for traveling or attending church unarmed.

However, while the colonists and early citizens of the United States were well-armed and saw virtually no restrictions on what arms they could own or when they could carry or use them in a peaceful manner, this was not true for all inhabitants of the land. Many people of color were brought to this country as slaves, and as property, they had no rights. Furthermore, free persons of color and Native Americans were often prevented by law from owning firearms.

Such gun control as Hogg champions would have hurt those fighting slavery. Abolitionists were highly unpopular and threatened with violence or worse. Rev. Elijah Parish Lovejoy, publisher of the abolitionist newspaper The Saint Louis Observer, was murdered by a pro-slavery mob who shot him before destroying his new printing press. Members of the Underground Railroad needed to protect themselves from law enforcement and bounty hunters enforcing fugitive slave laws, and so were often armed. The most famous example of these is Harriet Tubman, who carried a pistol for self defense while escorting runaway slaves to freedom.

While the 14th Amendment eliminated some of this discrimination, many additional laws were passed to keep people of color, the poor, and other “undesirables” from owning or carrying arms as part of the many Jim Crow laws of the time. Some of these statutes have survived to the present day, such as the North Carolina Pistol Purchase Permit. It requires that an applicant be of “good moral character” despite the fact that “The term ‘good moral character’ is not defined in our statutes nor is there a case specifically on point as to what constitutes good moral character for purposes of a pistol purchase permit.”

Needless to say, being a person of color was ample reason to deny a permit under these circumstances. Most famously, in 1950 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr, applied for an Alabama concealed-weapon permit after receiving death threats. He was, of course, denied. In the 1960s, California’s Mulford Act banned the open carry of firearms as a direct reaction to members of the Black Panthers patrolling minority neighborhoods while visibly armed.

More recently, 19 states maintained sodomy laws which, until their overturn by the Supreme Court in 2003, could mean the arrest and prosecution of people for “unethical sex acts,” i.e., consensual sex between queer people, the punishment for which would often be severe enough to make the convicted a person prohibited from owning firearms. Even today there is nothing to stop racist, sexist, or homophobic and transphobic police chiefs from denying people permits because of their race, religion, gender presentation, or sexuality in jurisdictions with may-issue gun laws.

Hogg’s ridiculous claims not only ignore history, but discount how all gun control disproportionately affects queer people and people of color. Or, put another way: Hogg isn’t just wrong, he’s fractally wrong: not merely wrong, but wrong on every scale, with pockets of small wrongness concealed within larger wrongness; wrong from any analytical viewpoint, with each piece self-similarly wrong.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/02/05/no-david-hogg-minority-and-lgbt-people-did-not-start-the-anti-gun-movement/,2020-02-05
‘Sesame Street’ To Feature Cross-Dressing Gay Entertainer,"The popular TV program “Sesame Street” will soon feature Billy Porter, a cross-dressing homosexual entertainer. According to the Huffington Post. “Billy Porter dusted off his now-iconic velvet tuxedo dress for a forthcoming appearance on ‘Sesame Street.’”

Yes, that fun and often educational children’s TV series that taught you the letters of the alphabet decades ago is now preparing to teach your kids or grandkids that men dressing like women and having intimate relationships with other men is as normal as learning the alphabet —and how to form those alphabet letters into real words, like gay and transgender.

“Children are sponges. They soak up everything they are exposed to. For instance, if a child is exposed from birth to three different languages, he will become fluent in all three in what appears to be an effortless fashion,” says the American College of Pediatricians.

Young children learn through imitation. According to Parents magazine, “By 15 months, most toddlers have developed the motor and cognitive skills necessary to carry out the action to be imitated. Children this age are usually mobile and have some hand-eye coordination. What drives toddler imitation? In part, it’s the instant connection that mimicry creates between parent and child.”

Children imitate more than their parents. Watching a cross-dressing gay man interact with their favorite TV characters is sure to affect impressionable young minds.

No doubt the producers and writers of “Sesame Street” are well aware that, as reported by the Center on Media and Child Health, “In young children, television can negatively impact a variety of executive functions. In older children and teens, violent media can lead to poorer results on executive functioning tests.” Television programs are influential; that is beyond question. What is open to argument is whether a program’s influence is positive or negative.

“Sesame Street” was designed to teach young children positive messages in an entertaining fashion. The “Sesame Street” crew has always known the persuasive potential of TV as a teaching tool.

As Maureen Healy, an author who specializes in children’s emotional health, wrote: “Children up to the age of eight are the most impressionable… Up to this point, they cannot distinguish what is seen on television or in video games from reality. They often imitate what they see, believing that monsters are real and people can have super powers. To ensure that children have positive experiences and learn the difference between a game or show and what happens in real life, parents must pay attention to what kids are viewing.”

The evidence is conclusive: television programs have enormous power to influence and even indoctrinate young children’s minds. So, if an immensely popular children’s TV series like “Sesame Street” uses its teaching platform to teach its young viewers that homosexuality and transgenderism are normal and healthy, is it telling the truth? Is it helping or harming those impressionable young minds?

Recent polls show that a significant majority of Americans (63 percent in a Pew Survey) say they approve of homosexual relationships. U.S. culture is increasingly and now majority-affirming for LGBT people. Yet LGBT people still struggle with mental and physical health compared to heterosexual peers.

“[F]ew homosexual relationships last longer than two years, with many men reporting hundreds of lifetime partners,” according to a research review by international scholars. Monogamous marriage reduces the risk of heart attack. Committed partners become less sensitive to pain. People in long-term monogamous relationships also tend to live longer.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “Studies have shown that, when compared with the general population, gay and bisexual men, lesbian, and transgender individuals are more likely to: Use alcohol and drugs, Have higher rates of substance abuse, Not withhold from alcohol and drug use, and Continue heavy drinking into later life.”

Meanwhile, 65 percent of Hispanics age 18 to 29 said they have experienced discrimination. Yet substance abuse among this cohort is not higher than the national average. As long as it remains possible that homosexual and transgender behavior might in itself cause LGBT people’s higher health risks, caution should be the byword regarding messages—including from popular TV shows—to impressionable children.

Further, regardless of the potential effects of LGBT identification, sex and sexuality is simply not an appropriate topic for small children, who are nowhere near puberty. Sex is an adult topic, period.

Healy writes, “To ensure that children have positive experiences and learn the difference between a game or show and what happens in real life, parents must pay attention to what kids are viewing.” Unfortunately, many parents—perhaps most—assume “Sesame Street” is a safe children’s TV program and may not feel the need to pay attention to what the program is teaching their children.

That’s why LifeSite News has begun a petition to demand that the producers of “Sesame Street” drop the “Drag Queen” episode. Please go sign this petition—and pay attention to the programs that influence your children.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/02/06/sesame-street-to-feature-cross-dressing-gay-entertainer-for-impressionable-preschoolers/,2020-02-06
'Miss Americana' Affirms Taylor Swift Is Using Her Platform For Politics,"Netflix’s much-anticipated documentary “Taylor Swift: Miss Americana,” directed by Lana Wilson, was released Jan. 31 to rave reviews from fans and mild compliments from critics, who applauded Wilson’s ability to get at the “real” Taylor.

Promoted as an intimate look at one of the music industry’s biggest megastars, the documentary actually spends very little time on Swift’s rise, her switch in music genres, or anything personal that isn’t already a matter of public record. “Miss Americana” instead spends a lot of time on politics, and Wilson delivers an inside look at Swift’s decision to reverse her much-criticized policy of staying out of the political arena.

Taylor Swift’s Journey to Wokeness

“Miss Americana” is really about how Taylor Swift got woke. Conservatives like to gloat about how little influence celebrities have on elections, but Swift’s decision to come out in favor of Democrat Phil Bredesen in the 2019 midterm election may have affected youth voter turnout in Tennessee.

The documentary claims more than 50,000 young voters registered last-minute, allegedly due to Swift’s plea to her fans to get involved, although election trends indicate spiked voter registration before an election is the norm. She posted her political coming-out statement on Instagram, where she has 126 million followers. As Swift notes at one point, millions of them will soon be voters, and she plans to use her platform to shape their views. It’s possible, however, this statement actually unintentionally spurred voters to hit the polls for Marsha Blackburn, since Tennessee is a red state.

Swift’s supposed metamorphosis is so painfully wooden, one suspects she green-lit the documentary specifically to plug her leftist bona fides. At one point she actually clinks her wine glass and announces, “Cheers to the Resistance!”

“Miss Americana” is the saga of Swift’s willingness to “run from fascism” — yes, she said that — and it plods through her throes of conscience, her argument with her handlers over whether she should go political, and the tremendous weight that apparently lifted off her shoulders when she joined the other courageous celebrities who have dared to brave the backlash and step out against Donald J. Trump.

“I feel really good about not being muzzled anymore,” she says at one point. In what is clearly supposed to be a climactic and moving moment, “Miss Americana” highlights her tearful reaction to Tennessee Republican Marsha Blackburn’s Senate victory over Bredesen, with Swift calling Blackburn “Trump in a wig” and “the kind of female” who appeals to “the kind of female males want us to be in a horrendous, 1950s world.” Swift just doesn’t understand how someone so evil could have accrued so many votes.

‘Miss Americana’ Also Demonizes Christians

Considering Swift’s astronomical popularity among young people, conservatives should think twice before shrugging off her potential influence. “Miss Americana” revealed Swift isn’t just going to release the occasional political bromide to fend off her progressive critics. She’s going to go after conservative Christians with all the venom of a new convert.

In fact, she’s started already: The documentary features her claiming religious liberty laws do not represent Tennessee values nor Christian values, which she knows because she’s from Tennessee, and she’s a Christian. With that, she goes on to repeat the absurd left lie that Christians want gay couples to be refused service in restaurants.

She was motivated to intervene in politics, she says, because she feels like a hypocrite saying, “‘Happy Pride Month, you guys!’ when someone is literally coming for their neck.” She doesn’t explain who, exactly, is “literally” coming for anyone’s neck, or what that might look like. Perhaps it’s just ignorance, but for tens of millions of Taylor fans to be told by their idol that Christian politicians are “literally” coming for the necks of LGBT folks and want them tossed out of restaurants is hugely going to accelerate the demonization of conservative Christians in America.

What better way to demonize the white-trash Christians than to release a music video exposing them as the snaggletoothed, stupid hicks they are? In June 2019, Swift came out as an official ally with “You Need To Calm Down,” which features a squad of her new LGBT friends taking over a trailer park, where illiterate haters flail helplessly against their collective fabulousness.

While trans activists such as Laverne Cox prance about, ugly, angry, illiterate people protest with signs featuring slogans such as “Homasekualty Is Sin!” This is in stark contrast to men tenderly kissing each other and twerking LGBT activists who obviously just want to have fun. Swift’s lyrics make it crystal clear:

You are somebody that we don’t know

But you’re comin’ at my friends like a missile

Why are you mad?

When you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)

Sunshine on the street at the parade

But you would rather be in the dark age

Just makin’ that sign must’ve taken all night.

Taylor Swift Is Just Trying to Stay Relevant

“Miss Americana” shows a few behind-the-scenes glimpses of the music video’s creation, highlighting Swift’s almost pathetic and over-the-top eagerness to please her LGBT friends. “Literally just call me for anything,” she tells Jonathan Van Ness, the gay activist and expert for Netflix’s “Queer Eye.” Unsurprisingly, “You Need To Calm Down” won a VMA, and Swift used the platform to advocate for the Equality Act, which critics warn could wipe out pro-life laws and religious liberty protections in all 50 states overnight.

Interestingly, Swift inadvertently reveals what might be one of the key reasons for her transformation when she explains that female artists in the music industry must constantly reinvent themselves to stay relevant and to maintain their popularity. “Miss Americana” moves smoothly and obliviously from that point to Swift’s much-lauded entrance into the Resistance, telegraphing a loud-and-clear message to her progressive critics: You told me to pick a side; I did. With that, Swift has reinvented herself again, and her career has taken on new significance as LGBT activists nod approvingly at her genuflection.

“I’m trying to be as educated as possible on how to respect people,” Taylor tells the camera blithely as she explains her re-education. She doesn’t explain how that fits in with her award-winning portrayal of conservative Christians as illiterate trailer-park trash, but then again, she doesn’t have to. Swift is now, as she says at one point, on “the right side of history,” and the pathetic rubes on the other side don’t deserve her respect.

“Miss Americana” ends with the words of one of Swift’s latest songs:

Combat, I’m ready for combat

I say I don’t want that, but what if I do?

‘Cause cruelty wins in the movies

I’ve got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you

Taylor Swift has picked a side, and she’s ready for combat. With who? I think we know.

Ohio Court Orders Professor To Use Trans Pronouns Or Lose His Job,"A Shawnee State University professor of religion and philosophy, Nicholas Meriwether, has been told by a federal court that despite his religious objections, he must use the preferred pronouns of transgender students if he wishes to keep his job. Shawnee is a four-year state university in Portsmouth, Ohio.

In late 2018, a transgender student, a male who identified as a female, approached Meriwether and asked him to use feminine pronouns for the student. According to Alliance Defending Freedom, Meriwether declined, and the student “became aggressive, circling around him, getting in his face in a threatening fashion, while telling him, ‘Then I guess this means I can call you a c**t.’” The student threatened to have the professor fired and filed a formal complaint with the university.

The university agreed with the student and formally charged the professor with creating a “hostile” environment and violating the university’s anti-discrimination policy. ADF filed a lawsuit on Meriwether’s behalf, saying, “Shawnee State officials have also ignored the Constitution, which guarantees the right of all Americans to speak freely.” The court dismissed the professor’s suit for failing to effectively prove he faced discrimination for his beliefs.

The court determined, “Plaintiff’s refusal to address a student in class in accordance with the student’s gender identity does not implicate broader societal concerns and the free speech clause of the First Amendment under the circumstances of this case,” reasoning that the use of titles is not considered speech, but is conduct in violation of the university’s anti-discrimination policies. The court further determined the professor was not compelled to use speech he morally opposed, as the university gave him the option of either removing all gendered language from his classroom or addressing each student according to his or her individual preference.

Meriwether Attempts to Compromise; No Dice

Meriwether had attempted a compromise of using the transgender student’s last name without a gendered title, differing from his classroom practice of addressing students as Mr. or Ms. and their last name. The student refused to accept this compromise, and the university viewed Meriwether’s proposition as discriminatory.

The court said the professor could have used only the last name of all students without reference to sex and chose not to. The court concluded Meriwether was not forced to espouse or express a view he disagreed with or found objectionable, determining that the use of pronouns or titles is not the expression of a belief.

The court rejected the professor’s religious objections, saying the reasonable-person standard would not consider using preferred pronouns as unreasonable and that the anti-discrimination policy is “neutral” and therefore not specifically affecting any religious group or belief. Most shockingly, the court upheld the university’s position that it could not accommodate the professor due to his religious objection, as it would then be required to make similar accommodations for racist or sexist views as well.

Strangely, the court determined Meriwether faced no form of discrimination for his religious beliefs after his superior openly laughed at his concerns during their meeting and compared his views to those of racists. Meriwether also could not prove other faculty who opposed gender identity accommodations had been treated differently than he had been. Essentially, because the university would have disciplined all faculty refusing to use preferred pronouns equally, the court decided no discrimination was present.

The Court’s Reasoning Is Unreasonable

The court’s assumptions are, of course, deeply concerning. For starters, the court simply assumed approving of a false gender identity to be a common and reasonable standard of conduct for public employees. This is an imposed view rather than an objective observation of current social standards.

This is further compounded by the court’s dismissal of the idea that the use of gender identity pronouns is something a person could reasonably find objectionable or against his personal beliefs. The idea that the situation itself is not one of “public concern” demonstrates the judge’s bias.

Jae Keniston, president of Shawnee’s LGBT organization SAGA, argued, “Since this lawsuit began, transgender students have been worried that they would have to start skipping classes or avoid particular professors because Shawnee State would no longer be able to effectively address bullying, harassment, and mistreatment of transgender students.” Clearly the university, which sided with the LGBT organization and the transgender student involved in the complaint, decided the use of preferred pronouns was an explicit expression of belief and of great social concern.

To dismiss the personal, religious beliefs of the professor as irrelevant to the issue at hand while positioning the personal beliefs of the LGBT students as fundamental is a demonstration of clear and overt bias and discrimination. If using the student’s preferred pronouns didn’t personally affect the professor, then the argument that refusing to use those pronouns negatively affected the student doesn’t hold water. The preference toward the transgender student is obvious, and both the university and the court chose an ideological side before considering the facts or the equal application of the policies in place.

Christianity Isn’t Harassment

LGBTQ Nation cheered the decision: “The Constitution doesn’t protect a Christian teacher harassing transgender students, even if it’s his ‘sincerely held religious belief.’” Considering gender-neutral language toward a student to be “harassment” or “mistreatment” is a truly remarkable standard.

Intentionally misrepresented in this discussion is the notion that the use of preferred pronouns is in any way neutral to personal beliefs. For a person to refer to a man with female pronouns, names, or titles is to participate in a specific political and social activity. To do so is to explicitly state, in public, that one accepts and promotes gender identity as a valid and legitimate reality. This is far from neutral.

The comparison of Christian views to racism and sexism, the university’s open mockery, the dismissal of religious freedom, and the claim that the professor engaged in bigotry and malice demonstrates profound religious intolerance and public shaming of conservative Christian belief. The professor recognized he was receiving an ultimatum of either publicly disavowing his religious beliefs or losing his career. In response, he attempted to provide a reasonable compromise that respected the student. The student and university chose to enforce the ultimatum, and sadly, the U.S. District Court of Southern Ohio agreed.

WI Parents Sue To Keep Schools From Hiding Kids' Gender Dysphoria,"Wisconsin’s second-largest school district so far won’t back off a policy of keeping minor students’ transgender experimentation secret from their parents despite a new lawsuit filed Tuesday.

A group of parents represented by Wisconsin Institute of Law and Liberty sued after the Madison Metropolitan School District refused to alter its policy of concealing childrens’ transgender behavior and related medical records from parents, no matter how young the child is. The district oversees children as young as preschoolers, and teaches gender identity politics to all ages, which research suggests may contribute to children identifying as transgender.

Among other things, the district’s policy at the heart of the lawsuit states: “School staff shall not disclose any information that may reveal a student’s gender identity to others, including parents or guardians and other school staff, unless legally required to do so or unless the student has authorized such disclosure.” It also says school staff will “discuss with the student contingency plans in the event that their privacy is compromised.”

Fourteen parents of children who attend Madison schools sued on grounds the policy violates their parental rights and longstanding requirements for parent approval of much less affecting activities such as attending prom and taking Tylenol. One of their court filings notes the district’s deceptions include “to evade the state law that requires Wisconsin schools to give parents access to all education records, the [Gender Support Plan] form directs teachers to keep this paperwork ‘in your confidential files, not in student records.'”

“MMSD prioritizes working in collaboration with families to support our students and it is always our preferred method of support. MMSD must also prioritize the safety and wellbeing of every individual student who walks through its doors each day. It is with this focus, the district stands by its guidance document on transgender and non-binary students, and recognizes its tremendous responsibility to uphold the right of every child to be educated in a safe, all-inclusive and nondiscriminatory learning environment,” said a Tuesday statement from Public Information Officer Tim LeMonds in response to the lawsuit. LeMonds said the district wouldn’t discuss the lawsuit until its lawyers had reviewed it.

Madison schools oversee approximately 27,000 students and spend $15,000 per student per year, according to federal records. On the latest state tests, which are of lower quality than independent tests such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress, 61 percent of Madison’s students were not proficient in reading and 59 percent were not proficient in math. In both cases, Madison students scored below state averages.

What Madison Schools Do Teach Kids

Madison’s transgender policy document tells teachers and staff how to handle a variety of LGBT issues. It says gender dysphoric children may wear opposite-sex clothing and participate in opposite-sex locker and changing rooms. “Transgender, non-binary, and gender-expansive students may request time to address their class about their gender identity and pronouns,” the guide says.

In 2017 at a California public school, a kindergartener did this sort of “gender reveal” to classmates, who went home afterwards with tears and confusion to parents who had not been informed of the event beforehand. Last year in a Madison elementary school, a male science teacher showed all the K-5 students a “gender reveal” video to come out to the children as transgender.

Madison’s policy document tells teachers explicitly to “Teach about gender! Include books and lessons that are inclusive of all identities and send messages of empowerment to students.” A district website guiding teachers how to do this provides book lists and lesson plans from a nationwide program called Welcoming Schools, run by the LGBT activist group Human Rights Campaign.

The Madison schools’ “top picture books” list from HRC recommends titles for preschoolers through early elementary children, including the book by transgender celebrity teen Jazz Jennings “I Am Jazz,” which tells children they can have boy brains in girl bodies. HRC and the National Education Association, the nation’s largest teachers union, sponsors annual readings of “I Am Jazz” in public schools and libraries.

Madison’s recommended classroom list also includes a picture book for grades one to three about Harvey Milk, “Pride: The Story of Harvey Milk and the Rainbow Flag.” Milk repeatedly had sex with underage boys, according to his biographers.

Another Madison schools-recommended book, for grades preschool to two, is titled “Jacob’s New Dress.” For grades four to six — children ages nine through twelve — the district recommends the book “Queer Heroes: Meet 53 LGBTQ Heroes From Past and Present!” and one for grades five to nine the list summarizes this way: “Zenobia July is starting a new life in Maine with her aunts. People used to tell her she was a boy; now she’s able to live openly as the girl she always knew she was.”

A parent whose kindergartener attends a Madison elementary school sent The Federalist screenshots of a coloring book he says his daughter was sent home with for Black Lives Matter Week this February. Besides informing five-year-olds what transgender and queer mean, it also celebrates the Black Panthers and and the long-standing Communist Party goal of “Disrupting the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure.” The district’s transgender policy also pledges it to “model gender-inclusive language that…disrupts the gender binary.”

Selected coloring book pages that match what the father sent are below, obtained from BlackLivesMatteratSchool.com. That website also shows videos of elementary schoolers in Milwaukee public schools, Wisconsin’s largest school district, waving a “Pan-African” flag instead of an American flag. The man who inspired the flag says its red stripe represents communism (“the reds of the world”). Both the coloring book and the recommended LGBT books equate African-Americans’ equal rights with LGBT special rights, even though race is inborn and unchangeable while sexuality is a fluid behavior for which researchers still cannot find a genetic component.

LeMonds said the coloring book was likely a single teacher’s lesson decision and was not recommended by the school district like the LGBT books above.

As a result of the district’s social conditioning efforts with kids, “Now being an [LGBT] ally gains kids social capital, and now being an ally is cool,” says Kristi Nelson, a Madison school psychologist, in a video about the Welcoming Schools program. This is the kind of social environment a Brown University researcher found may contribute to a “social contagion” in which children who are often sad or distressed for other reasons find desperately needed positive attention in identifying as transgender.

This Sort of Thing Is Cropping Up Everywhere

This isn’t just happening in Madison, which has long been a far-left city. The Wisconsin Department of Public Instrution recommends similar resources from LGBT activist group GLSEN. And the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, which oversees Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana, in 2017 upheld a Wisconsin transgender student’s demand to use opposite-sex bathrooms and locker rooms.

“The decision makes the 7th Circuit the first appeals court to interpret both Title IX and the Constitution as protecting transgender students from discrimination — and requiring schools to allow transgender students to use the bathroom matching their gender identity,” reported the Washington Post.

Luke Berg, an attorney representing parents through WILL, said in an interview, “I haven’t done an extensive survey in Wisconsin although I’ve heard that other districts have similar policies. Madison’s is probably the worst but I think a lot of these groups are telling schools that this is what they have to do, that this is legally required, that students have a legal right to exclude their parents.”

District Policy May Artificially Inflate Trans Identification

The suing parents seek a preliminary injunction to keep Madison’s transgender policy from affecting children as the lawsuit is worked out. That injunction, however, would not apply to the LGBT picture books, coloring books, and other materials Madison teachers are showing kids in class. It would only apply to the district’s policy of hiding children’s dysphoria from parents after the dysphoria has manifested.

In their court briefs, the parents’ lawyers note that 80-90 of children who identify as transgender ultimately choose to live as their sex — if they are not given transgender hormones. Only 20 percent of children whose bodies are mutilated with hormones and surgery before puberty ultimately choose to live as their sex.

“So, by enabling and encouraging children to transition at school without parental consent, the District may be pushing children down that path, causing gender dysphoria to persist when it otherwise would have desisted,” the parent’s injunction application says.

A hearing on the case is likely by April, with a court decision expected a month or two afterward, Berg said.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/02/20/wisconsin-parents-sue-to-keep-schools-from-hiding-their-kids-gender-dysphoria/,2020-02-20
U.K. Starbucks Raises Money To Chemically Castrate Trans Children,"They told me that Brexit would turn Britain into a barbarous land, and they were right: U.K. Starbucks is now raising money to promote the chemical sterilization and surgical mutilation of children. The British branch of the beverage-slinging behemoth is selling special mermaid-shaped cookies to benefit transgender lobbyist group Mermaids, whose founder infamously took her underage son to Thailand to be castrated.

That personal extremism sets the tone for the group’s agenda, which is all about earlier and more permanent transitions for children, with less screening and fewer safeguards beforehand. That Starbucks is supporting this group illustrates how thoroughly radicals have conquered both the LGBT movement and corporate culture. In a few years the fight has shifted from government recognition of same-sex relationships as legal marriages to mastectomies, sterilization, and castration for children.

That raises the question, both in this specific instance and more generally: why doesn’t anyone say no? Why didn’t someone at Starbucks speak up and say that, even though the company is left-leaning and LGBT-friendly, fundraising for a group that is pushing to permanently transition children earlier and earlier is going too far? More broadly, why don’t people speak up in other settings, from universities to newsrooms to the current Democratic primary—why can’t anyone on the left say no to the radicals?

After all, true believers in the left’s fashionable shibboleths regarding gender, race, sexuality, etc. are a small minority of the population, and often a minority even in left-leaning institutions. Yet they nonetheless wield disproportionate cultural power.

This is partly due to familiar social dynamics. It is not news that a dedicated minority may dominate a disinterested and disorganized majority. After all, dissenters who initially speak up will be targeted, and therefore many who might quietly agree with them will nonetheless be too cowed to join in. But this does not explain why leftist ideologues in particular, as opposed to some other minority viewpoint, have achieved such power.

So, once again, why? Why do university presidents grovel before student protestors? Why did Chick-fil-A capitulate to LGBT complaints despite the chain’s incredible success? Why did Starbucks executives agree to fundraise for a radical group pushing to chemically and surgically sterilize children? What is it in the makeup of our educated, professional classes that leaves them so vulnerable to particular kinds of left-wing cultural pressure?

A partial answer may be made by considering how members of this class view the imperfection of the world. They are not likely to think in ancient terms of personal virtue and vice. Nor do they usually subscribe to the Christian traditions of reflection on the Fall and human sin, both original and personal. Yet the imperfection of the world, the social order, and ourselves remains a fundamental human reality that all daily experience.

By historical standards most of us, and our elites in particular, are extraordinarily well-off. Nonetheless, the world remains flawed, and our leadership class increasingly faces that reality without a strong tradition of philosophical or theological reflection to draw on. Even many who are nominal Christians have very little idea what Christianity teaches, especially on uncomfortable subjects like sin.

But a substitute is available for them. The theories of intersectional leftism, with their analysis of power, privilege, and oppression, function very similarly to Christian doctrines of original sin. According to these ideas of social justice and injustice, what is wrong with the world is that we are divided into hierarchies and power structures built around race, class, gender, sexual identity and so on.

We are all born into this, and participation in the systems of oppression constructed upon these categories can no more be avoided than original sin can be in the Christian tradition. However, we can identify our privileges, and work to deconstruct and dismantle the systems of oppression they are derived from.

Thus, these ideas have analogues for both the Christian concepts of original sin and personal sin. Just as Christians move easily between the two in discussions of sin, so too do leftists move easily between racism, sexism, and the rest as forms of systematic oppression that we are all guilty of by being born into society, and racism, sexism, and the rest as personal wrongs that we are also guilty of in specific instances.

Thus, efforts at diversity and inclusion of the marginalized are both penitential and redemptive. They atone for our unavoidable participation in general systems of oppression and for the particular wrongs we have committed under the influence of these systems. Although the struggle will never end, these efforts move toward a less oppressive world.

From this perspective, claiming to be innocent of wrongs against social justice is as ridiculous as a Christian would find claims of innocence regarding original and personal sin—claiming to be pure just shows how deadened one’s conscience is. Only a perfect victim, oppressed in every possible category, could be pure, so there is none righteous, no, not one. Still, there is relative righteousness, and those who identify as transgendered can claim it under this system.

Western elites, such as the people running Starbucks in the U.K., have largely been catechized into this view. They do not necessarily give it much thought—there are plenty of nominal believers in this system—but they often know little else. In particular, they lack a framework by which to contest the claims of the ostensibly oppressed. Like lukewarm Christians surrounded by the faithful, they cannot very well say no when a revival arrives and is embraced by the true believers; at the very least they have to go through the motions.

Thus, it is no surprise that no one at Starbucks stopped the trans children cookie fundraising extravaganza. Standing up to Mermaids would call into question much more than the group’s radical views on diagnosing and treating gender dysphoria in children. No one calling the shots at Starbucks was going to challenge the left’s entire theory of social justice.

After all, if trans adults are particularly oppressed, trans children must be doubly so. Doubting them (and their self-appointed spokesmen) is therefore an almost sacrilegious act of blasphemy against the holy. So the left progresses back to eunuchs and genital mutilation—funded by Starbucks cookies that are probably as average as the coffee.

"If I Were A Kid Today, Doctors Would Be Calling Me Transgender","One of my first memories is of sitting behind several shrubs that lined the playground of my preschool. I had an agreement with a few of the girls, who let me squirrel away a My Little Pony or two and perhaps some accessories. I would retreat to my hiding spot and indulge my curiosity of their bright colors and long, pretty hair. I don’t remember what stories I told or what adventures my toys had, but I remember how ashamed I was when a disapproving teacher found me, and worse yet, I remember the fear in my stomach on the ride home with my dad.

The anxiety I felt then carries with me to this day when someone comments on my feminine choices. I learned very early to be ashamed of what came so naturally to my experience of joy and curiosity. Only girls allowed me to be myself around them, so I identified most closely with them. I had no reason to believe being a girl would be far better than being a boy. For years after, I obsessed over this with prayers, wishes, and trying everything I could to manufacture a way to be feminine without shame.

As a teenager, one of the things that drew me to gay culture was watching men fully embrace feminine stereotypes, often to the extreme, without a hint of embarrassment. It permeated every aspect of their media and advocacy. It looked to me like a beautiful escape into a world of true freedom. Even as I lowered my head at school and kept a distance from my family, in my mind I was dancing alongside RuPaul and sashaying down the runway. This fantasy was the polar opposite of the world I knew.

What I didn’t understand then was that I didn’t need to escape or shift my sense of self from one extreme to the other to be “me.” What gay culture got wrong in the ’90s and 2000s was the idea that to be a gay man meant to be a caricature of yourself, a character, created solely for the purpose of public fascination and celebration. Many people like me expressed their repressed sense of freedom in opulent, self-destructive, and isolating flamboyance. What we all had in common was a resentful sense of rebellious validation.

LGBT Activists Double Down in Support of Trans Kids

Memories of this shared struggle for identity motivate many in the LGBT movement today in their blind support for the modern transgender agenda. They see themselves in the children being given the promise of a better future through transgender medical intervention. When they hear stories of children taking their lives and see the happy smiles on young boys twirling in princess dresses, they can’t help but identify with both realities. If only we had been given the chance to be embraced for who we were and allowed to flourish at such a young age as well.

So these activists double down in front of gender clinics and courthouses, and loudly shout down the representation of their childhood bullies. They believe they are doing what is right. As a result, they immediately reject all concerns and objections as hateful rhetoric — akin to how their parents and teachers worried their own gender non-confirming behavior would “make them gay.” With medical authorities on their side, they confidently march forward, believing this generation will be better than the last.

Just as my generation looked to the far-away gay centers of endless partying and celebration for hope, today children and teens across the country look to puberty blockers, hormones, and surgery for the same. As so many gay people found after indulging the culture for a time, that nothing there offered a personal sense of peace and purpose, so many trans children will discover, too late, the same in medical intervention.

Not All Gender Deviations Are Transgenderism

As a child, I would sit in my room frustrated by what seemed like adults in my life obsessing over my every thought and feeling. I wanted to relax, let my walls down, and just be. I looked in the mirror and wondered what was wrong with me and why I was the way I was. What excited me in life and brought out my creativity was viewed as something that needed to be “fixed.” I cannot imagine the burden of being told by everyone, including doctors, that all of this meant my body itself was wrong.

Somehow, liberals moved from advocating that femininity in boys was something to be encouraged and celebrated to arguing it represents some sort of birth defect requiring immediate medical intervention. These liberals now view feminine behavior, interests, and other stereotypical gender differences in boys as evidence of gender dysphoria. The left argues the only reason a boy would express any of these characteristics is that he is very literally a deformed girl who needs hormone replacement and extensive surgery to live as her true self.

Had medical thinking been the way it is today when I was a child, doctors would have sat me down with my parents to tell me the reason I liked the color pink and wanted to play with dolls was that I was actually female. They would have dressed me as a girl, given me a girl’s name, and injected me with puberty blockers to stop my physical development. By the time I reached my teenage years, I would have embraced my female identity, beginning extensive and lifelong medical treatment to force my body to look as womanly as possible.

Diversity of Expression Doesn’t Need to be Fixed

Rather than viewing my sensitive nature, creativity, and interest in stereotypical female gender norms as a problem to be solved, imagine if I had simply been accepted exactly as I was. Something we often accept in girls but not in boys is gender expression beyond what is culturally normal. Sadly, masculine behavior in girls is now increasingly evidence something is “wrong” with them too.

It is true that both boys and girls generally identify with fairly predictable gendered toys, colors, and interests. But it’s also true that some of us simply don’t, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with us.

When I watch the advocacy for transgender transition in children, all I can see is an organized effort to “correct” something that should never have been viewed as wrong in the first place. While gay activists may see themselves in these children and feel hope for them in this journey, I wish they could see the the harms that trans activists and medical professionals are perpetuating.

I wish they could see that the very qualities they celebrate in themselves are being used as medical evidence of a severe disorder. The religious right once advocated “praying the gay away” to counteract a deviation from sex and gender norms, and now the left seeks the same through what they consider medically necessary health care.

The most important lesson I learned throughout my journey to finding peace is that the feminine part of who I am is simply that, part of who I am. I wish I could have understood as a child that my personality was my own and my gender didn’t define who I was allowed to be. Being gay could have been another part of who I was, and I could have just grown up.

It took a long time, but I like the person I am today. Had I gone through transition, I would still be struggling to prove to the world and to myself that I deserve to be loved and accepted.

For all of their talk of a gender spectrum and gender fluidity, the left is Puritan about the rules of gender expression in children. We could all benefit from a return to the idea that sometimes boys are sensitive and creative, and sometimes girls are aggressive and competitive — and it’s perfectly okay. We don’t need to be “fixed.”

‘Vanderpump Rules’ Meets Charles Murray’s ‘Coming Apart’ In Fight Over Kentucky Pastor,"When “Vanderpump Rules” picks back up on Tuesday, the gang will still be reeling from backlash over Jax and Brittany’s pastor. Tom Sandoval, not content to let his friends off the hook, threw gasoline on the fire last week by confronting Jax over why it took the couple so long to cut ties with the man they planned to have marry them.

The culture war has arrived at “Vanderpump.” Anguish over the pastor was induced by news reports about his open promotion of traditional views on marriage and sexuality and opposition to LGBT causes. It would take anyone about ten minutes of watching “Vanderpump Rules” to know that just won’t fly at SUR. (Or Pump. Or TomTom. Or Villa Blanca. Or The Vanderpump Cocktail Garden.)

What’s not interesting is that a group of West Hollwyod-dwelling millennial Bravo stars are pro-LGBT. What’s actually interesting is how the drama impacted Brittany.

According to Brittany, a Christian who was raised in Kentucky, the pastor is a family friend. As his social media posts began surfacing more and more in the press, the ordeal clearly weighed heavily on her conscience. Rather than standing firm, of course, the couple ultimately replaced their pastor with gay pop star Lance Bass.

Yet it all made for a fascinating case study in the cultural pressures facing young people who leave their homes for big coastal cities. The drama brought Brittany, who’s not exactly known for her intellect, to an important realization. “In LA we kind of live in this bubble, so whenever I go back home there are people who believe all different kinds of things,” she explained during a confessional on last week’s episode.

“Some people believe in way different politics than we do, like there’s just so much you don’t really talk about, so when something like this does get brought up, it makes it very difficult because I don’t want to disappoint anyone in my life,” she continued, genuinely pained by the experience.

While some of the cast like to style themselves as political thinkers (they’re all extremely progressive and need us to know it), ironically, in this situation it was Brittany whose analysis was most cogent. She basically stumbled onto the patterns Charles Murray outlined in “Coming Apart.”

Murray, like Brittany, was concerned explicitly by “bubbles.” In explaining his famous bubble quiz, Murray wrote, “Your present life may be completely encased in the bubble, but you brought a lot of experience into the bubble that will always be part of your understanding of America.”

City Lab reported last year on a new study that found “not only have young people been a driving force in the urban resurgence of the past two decades, but they favor living in central urban neighborhoods significantly more than previous generations did at the same stages in life.” Whether the cohort of urban-dwelling millennials who came from rural and suburban communities is shaping the culture of cities or letting their new environments shape them is the question.

To be sure, nobody would confuse the “Vanderpump” cast for Harvard graduates who grew up in Greenwich and work in banking. But they’ve left their hometowns and made good money in LA. The pricey non-WeHo houses they all seem to have moved into this season are proof positive of that.

In a 2012 NPR interview on “Coming Apart,” Murray spoke of the ZIP codes with “levels of affluence and education that are so much higher than the rest of the population that they constitute a different kind of world.”

Murray added:

The people who run the country have enormous influence over the culture, politics, and the economics of the country. And increasingly, they haven’t a clue about how most of America lives. They have never experienced it. They don’t watch the same movies, they don’t watch the same television shows — they don’t watch television at all, in many cases — and when that happens, you get some policies that are pretty far out of whack.

Brittany is staunchly, and convincingly, in disagreement with her erstwhile pastor. Lisa Vanderpump herself attests to that. “It’s hard for me because this is my family friend,” Brittany said on last week’s episode. “No one ever thought that he would be this way. I grew up with my pastor’s daughters. He’s a great family man. Whenever I saw that he had posted all of these, like, very negative things, I don’t want anybody to feel uncomfortable, anybody to feel like I had those same feelings, because I just definitely do not.”

Got it. But watching Brittany struggle to explain the situation to her LA-based friends, most of whom have lived there much longer than her, was interesting. While her girl group was mostly supportive, the cast still seemed to have no notion that well-intentioned people could disagree with them on LGBT issues, much less tolerate or associate with anyone who does.

As cultural norms on marriage and sexuality shifted, and regional differences in lifestyle increased, a lot of millennials probably probably found themselves in Brittany’s shoes. When the show continues on Tuesday, Sandoval seems poised to keep the controversy coming, pressing Jax and Brittany over what they knew and when they knew it.

It’s an ugly fight, but one that at least represents a very realistic and very under appreciated culture clash. “Vanderpump Rules” is the best reality show on television, but occasionally it’s worth paying attention to for other reasons as well.

New Jersey Public Schools To Teach LGBT Ideology In Every Subject,"A little more than a year ago, the New Jersey Legislature passed, and Gov. Phil Murphy signed, a law mandating the teaching of LGBT subject matter in public school curriculum, beginning in 2020-21.

In response to the law, the activist group Garden State Equality has prepared a curriculum, currently piloted in 12 New Jersey schools and planned to be employed statewide in the fall. This is consistent with Murphy’s vision. At Garden State Equality’s 2019 Ball, he said, “I applaud Garden State Equality for not only leading this effort, but for your continued work in helping to craft this curriculum.”

Garden State Equality (GSE) is an LGBT advocacy organization devoted to instilling its vision of “justice” through an “LGBT lens” in society. Consistent with its vision, GSE’s self-described “LGBT-inclusive” curriculum spans all subjects — math, English, social studies, health, science, visual and performing arts, and world languages — beginning in fifth grade. Having New Jersey’s 1.4 million public school students see the world through a LGBT lens is the goal in every class and, thus, now the goal of public education. This is well in excess of the curriculum law’s vague requirements.

In the way it is being implemented, the law is simply an instrument empowering GSE to accomplish its mission and vision, embedding sexual and gender ideology throughout curriculum. GSE envisions its curriculum “as a model that we can bring to every other state in the nation.”

School Boards Should Reject GSE’s Curriculum

A number of grassroots parent coalitions from across New Jersey, representing the state’s diversity, are raising awareness about and opposing the co-opting of public school curriculum for such ideological purposes. Historically, public schools have been the gateway to American society for immigrant families. But now, immigrant families all over New Jersey are deeply troubled and perplexed regarding the apparent goals of public education and the interests it serves.

New Jersey’s more than 600 school districts are not technically required to adopt GSE’s curriculum, although they are required to comply with the new state LGBT curriculum law. GSE is also substantially involved in drafting the New Jersey Department of Education’s “guidance” to schools about implementing the LGBT curriculum law. However, New Jersey school districts are not required to accept such state “guidance,” allowing districts to take a careful and educated approach to the curriculum law’s implementation.

The sexual and gender ideology advanced through GSE’s curriculum, and through its direct involvement in the state’s guidance to public schools, should be rejected by the boards of education of all New Jersey school districts for at least the following reasons.

1. It Denies Reality and Welcomes Irrationality

The stated goal of sexual and gender ideology is to “get rid of the gender binary.” At public hearings concerning the school curriculum, advocates consistently characterize such a goal as a “must.”

We cannot get rid of the gender binary, however, as humans are a sexually dimorphic species. This reality can be denied, silenced, threatened, and punished. But it cannot be “rid of.” The existence of every person is proof of the union of what is uniquely male and uniquely female. While GSE may reject this most basic truth of humanity, it cannot eradicate it. And New Jersey public schools should not partner with its futile efforts to do so.

Beyond denying the gender binary, GSE insists a biological male who calls himself a woman is, in fact, a woman. If that’s the case, what is a woman? “Woman” becomes a word without meaning — as is the case when a biological female claims she’s a man. GSE’s ideology commands students to use such words. This does not educate, enlighten, or advance understanding. It mandates irrationality within school curriculum.

2. It Imposes Its Will on Children’s Bodies

GSE claims its teachings are for the good and safety of vulnerable children. Those teachings, however, result in the exact opposite. GSE demands giving puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to children, impeding the development of their bodies’ more than 37 trillion cells. It even demands the removal of healthy body parts, which is profoundly evil. These practices are the sexual, physical, mental, and emotional abuse of children, manipulating their bodies to conform to an ideology.

Teaching and endorsing such practices doesn’t educate, but makes students vulnerable to abuse. I don’t use the words “abuse” and “evil” to be inflammatory, but because they fit the described practices. GSE doesn’t accept the right of anyone to impede the imposition of its will on children’s minds and bodies, preventing even parents from taking actions to protect their own children from abusive measures.

3. It Is a Totalizing and Intolerant Ideology

The sexual and gender ideology of GSE and like-minded advocates addresses the most basic questions of life and meaning concerning our humanity. It even has its own language and vocabulary, which it expects everyone to adopt. It is a totalizing and comprehensive belief system, which functions as a religion. Instituting compulsory teaching within public schools effectively establishes such ideology as a state religion.

One of its core convictions is intolerance for any dissent. It mars those who disagree with epithets, such as “haters” and “bigots,” applying these labels to many families and students within every school district in New Jersey who would dare express disagreement. These accusations even include parents who object to giving their own child the harmful drugs commanded by sexual and gender activists.

The ideology insists that every new word or idea must be affirmed. Acceptance of sexual and gender ideology renders a person defenseless to its demands. None of this carries educational value.

Take a Stand to Protect Children

The Kelsey Coalition, formed in 2019 by “a group of concerned parents whose children have been harmed by transgender healthcare practices,” can serve as a resource to school districts, allowing them to make informed decisions for educating and protecting New Jersey students. As its website indicates, its membership now includes:

Young people who express profound regret that health care professionals offered them hormones and surgeries without helping them understand possible causes of their profound dysphoria or desire to transition;

Endocrinologists who warn about the effects of puberty-blocking drugs and cross-sex hormones, which are known to cause serious harm to children, including infertility and loss of sexual function;

Teachers who voice concerns that they are now required to change students’ names and pronouns without informing their parents, and who are wondering why so many children in their classroom identify as transgender;

Medical students who are challenging their training that instructs them to affirm without question young patients’ claims of being in the “wrong body”; and

Therapists who are worried about laws that now make it illegal for them to help their young clients explore why they believe they are transgender.

Surely, it would be highly immoral, unethical, and contrary to the educational and health interests of students not to inform them of the severe and irreparable harms that result from transgender physical interventions. Sexual and gender ideology pathologizes puberty, teaching that its suppression is a “treatment.” This article from an endocrinologist would educate students regarding life-altering effects on brain development, bone density, and sexual function, among other harms.

Regarding sex and gender, we are often warned against being on the “wrong side of history.” One day, the story will be told, and a chapter will cover what was done to children’s minds and bodies in the latter half of the 2010s into the 2020s. It will be included among the atrocities in the story of humanity’s inhumanity. It will be regarded with special horror because children will have been victimized in an impossible attempt to vindicate false adult beliefs and behaviors.

This historical moment provides an opportunity for every board of education member of every school district in New Jersey to be on the side of the story in which people courageously took a stand to protect children from such harms and horrors.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/02/27/new-jersey-public-schools-to-teach-lgbt-ideology-in-every-subject/,2020-02-27
Left Exploits HIV Tragedy To Claim Mike Pence Can't Manage Coronavirus,"Shortly after the announcement that Vice President Mike Pence will lead the U.S. response to the coronavirus threat, media began insisting Pence had “caused” the largest HIV outbreak in Indiana under his watch as governor. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., tweeted, “As governor, Pence’s science denial contributed to one of the worst HIV outbreaks in Indiana’s history. He is not a medical doctor. He is not a health expert. He is not qualified nor positioned in any way to protect our public health.”

In spring 2015, more than 140 people were diagnosed with HIV in Austin, Indiana, a town with a population of about 5,000. By the following year, that number reached more than 200, with the media calling it the “largest HIV outbreak in state history.”

The primary cause of the outbreak was a sudden upsurge in the use of the opioid drug Opana. As NPR reported at the time, “People figured out how to get around a coating on the pills intended to deter abuse, prepared them for injection and then shared needles to do so.”

Media Outrageously Blames Pence for HIV Outbreak

At the time of the outbreak, the media blamed Pence both for failing to fund Planned Parenthood facilities and for resisting efforts to lift the ban on needle-exchange programs in his state, claiming both were necessary to help HIV sufferers. The Huffington Post reported in 2015, “The Scott County clinic and four other Planned Parenthood facilities in the state, all of which provided HIV testing and information, have shuttered since 2011, in large part due to funding cuts to the state’s public health infrastructure.” Arguing that Planned Parenthood was the only HIV testing center in the county, advocates argued Pence denied residents the ability to access medical treatment.

As for the needle-exchange policy, Robert Childs, executive director of the North Carolina Harm Reduction Coalition, argued, “People think that if you give someone a syringe, it means they’re going to go out and inject drugs, and if [you] don’t give them syringes, they won’t inject drugs.” Under pressure in March 2015, Pence allowed a 30-day exception to the needle-exchange ban in the most affected county, which the media portrayed as “slow action” to address the outbreak that Pence “enabled” through his public health policies.

Despite the Washington Post saying there is only one clinic in Austin, Indiana, a search shows dozens of medical providers in the city. The Huffington Post said the Planned Parenthood was the only HIV testing center in the city and since its closing in 2013 has falsely stated, “[T]here was no longer a place for the county’s 24,000 residents to get tested.”

In 2005, Planned Parenthood of Indiana received $3.3 million in grant and government contract funding. By 2014, this dropped to $1.9 million to support five statewide clinics. Any hospital can perform HIV testing, which is routine in emergency departments. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provided a series of recommendations for screening patients in 2006.

HIV testing is so common, testing kits can be purchased online for privacy concerns. As with all health departments, including the Scott County Health Department, HIV testing is free.

High-Risk Behaviors Can Mean Terrible Consequences

In the left’s narrow view of HIV and drug use, insufficient HIV testing and needle-exchange programs caused the problem. The left doesn’t consider the risk behaviors relevant. NPR accidentally provided a potent reminder of this, reporting, “When news of the HIV infections broke, Kevin Polly was one of the few people in Austin willing to go on the record and say he was using Opana. Polly had contracted HIV, and at the time told a CBS reporter he had no plans to quit injecting the drug.”

The Opana manufacturer had added a pill coating to reduce abuse through slower release. Those who illegally injected the drug figured out how to remove the coating. This clearly isn’t just a problem of government-run public health programs.

The argument for needle-exchange programs is compelling but not absolute. When the ban was temporarily lifted, the outbreak was contained. Opposition to the program is equally valid, however, as needle-exchange does nothing to address illegal drug use; it only reduces the spread of blood-borne infections through one avenue of transmission.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, injection is the second-highest risk behavior for the spread of HIV, which can survive 42 days inside a syringe. Reducing infection is a positive goal, but many oppose taxpayer-funded programs enabling illegal drug use.

Clean needles may reduce HIV exposure through the injection itself, but as the CDC warns, “[P]eople who inject drugs can have other serious health problems, like skin infections and heart infections.” The CDC clearly states substance abuse increases the chance of dangerous sex practices, which also increase the chances of infection.

The left simply refuses to recognize that engaging in high-risk behaviors increases a person’s chances of contracting many serious diseases, and no amount of government-funded efforts will keep a person from choosing this path. HIV prevention begins with personal responsibility. HIV treatment requires a person to seek help, which is abundant and largely low-cost or free nationwide. Pence did not hand these people drugs, nor is he responsible for the consequences of their actions.

The Left Smears Pence for Political Gain

The Democratic Party is willing to exploit anything for political advantage, and they know they can emotionally manipulate LGBT activists through claiming Pence “ignored” an HIV outbreak in his state. The facts, however, show that HIV infection clustering due to intravenous drug use is not isolated. In 2018, a cluster of 74 cases were reported in Cabell County, West Virginia, in what Politico called an “unusually robust public health system.”

The report concluded, “But the fact that the cases have occurred despite the county’s surveillance and prevention is also worrisome.” Lawrence and Lowell, two Massachusetts cities, experienced a spike of 52 new HIV infections due to intravenous drug use in 2017. Similar clusters have been found in Kentucky, Ohio, and Seattle, Washington.

Using the hashtag “Pencedemic,” the LGBT activist group Human Rights Campaign tweeted, “1/ REMINDER: Mike Pence’s record in Indiana casts real doubt on his ability to be coronavirus czar. While serving as governor of Indiana, Pence exacerbated an HIV crisis by slow-walking possible solutions.” A major HIV information and advocacy source, POZ Magazine, also claimed, “Mike Pence’s Delayed Response to #HIV Outbreak in Indiana Had Grave Results — Many of the 215 injection-drug-related HIV infections could have been averted from a swifter response, according to researchers’ estimates.”

It seems the only reason the media, LGBT advocacy organizations, and Democratic leaders have targeted the Indiana outbreak is because Pence was governor when it happened. They needed a reason to attack him, so they exploited what would otherwise be considered a national concern in the opioid crisis.

It seems the left is willing to continue this exploitation to gain political advantage in what could be a significant challenge to public health. The media and LGBT advocacy organizations’ mindless hatred of President Trump and conservatives overshadows the real risk factors in the spread of HIV. There is no way to know if any action Pence may have taken would have curbed the infection rate at the time. To claim that Pence puts America at risk for coronavirus intentionally creates fear and paranoia, fueling the fires of hatred.

Validating Suicide In Response To Transgender Skepticism Is Irresponsible,"When Kayden Satya Ortiz attended Robinson Secondary School in Fairfax, Va., she began every school year by writing the same message to every one of her teachers. It went something like this, according to a January article in the Washington Post: “I am transgender. I use he/him/his pronouns. Please put this in your records now.”

Ortiz, now 22, explains that it frequently didn’t work, and that educators and classmates addressed her with her original name and female pronouns. “It hits you, every time it happens,” Ortiz said. “It’s a physical pain in the heart.” She says that because of that pain, as well as bullying, a prohibition against Ortiz using the boy’s restroom, and “insufficient support from administrators,” Ortiz tried to kill herself a dozen times in high school.

For many transgender youth, Ortiz’s story is concerningly familiar. In 2019, The Trevor Project, an LGBT suicide prevention organization, conducted the largest national survey of LGBT youth ever, with 34,000 respondents aged 13 to 24. Of the 25,896 valid respondents, 39 percent acknowledged they had considered suicide in the last year.

The percentage was highest among transgender and non-binary respondents: 29 percent claimed they’d attempted suicide. These stories gain significant traction in left-leaning mainstream media. In October 2019, NBC ran a story on a number of LGBTQ persons who were “driven” to suicide because of bullying and people unsympathetic to their new identities. Rolling Stone similarly announced: “Nearly 40% of LGBTQ Youth Have Contemplated Suicide: Report.”

Yet is Ortiz’s story, and many like hers, reducible only to harassment and bullying, or are other factors at work? Even pro-transgender organizations acknowledge that mental illness is a much greater problem among transgender persons than among the general population.

Research shows about half of trans persons in the United States suffer from depression or anxiety disorder. In 2017, 41 percent of trans adults in the United States said they had attempted suicide in their lives. It’s certainly possible that cultural stigma against transgenderism is behind these rates. Mistreatment of transgender people is obviously unacceptable and harmful. Yet it’s also possible that left-leaning media’s laser-focused attention on transgender persons, and encouraged by pro-transgender medical practioners and politicians, contribute to aggravating this problem.

More Media Attention Encourages Suicide

There is plentiful research demonstrating that increased public attention to suicide has the unintended consequence of encouraging suicidal thoughts among the most vulnerable. According to Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute, “more than 50 studies on nonfictional stories reported in newspapers, on television, and more recently on the Internet, have yielded consistent findings. Suicide rates go up following an increase in the frequency of stories about suicide.”

As Federalist contributor Chad Felix Greene has argued, media narratives that implicitly tell 13- to 16-year-olds they are “supposed to be afraid, anxious, depressed, and isolated from their peers” is likely going to aggravate those feelings. Greene is right: this obsession is unintentionally “causing the very symptoms we wish to fight.”

This is compounded by medical transgender enthusiasts. One such pro-transgender psychologist, Dr. Wallace Wong, has advised parents seeking to get their child referred for his gender transition treatment to exaggerate the severity of their child’s mental health issues to local health offices.

Wong presented a suicide threat as one effective means of persuasion: “So what you need is, you know what? Pull a stunt. Suicide, every time, [then] they will give you what you need,” Wong said, adding that gender-dysphoric kids “learn that. They learn it very fast.” When medical practitioners like Wong encourage kids to either attempt or fake a suicide, we shouldn’t be quite as surprised when they take his advice.

We can also add to the mix politicians who claim that opposition to transgenderism, particularly from religious communities, presents an existential threat to the mental health of transgender persons. In June 2019, California lawmakers passed ACR-99, which claims that some religious beliefs are responsible for actually killing people, including children. The text of the bill reads:

WHEREAS, The stigma associated with being LGBT often created by groups in society, including therapists and religious groups, has caused disproportionately high rates of suicide, attempted suicide, depression, rejection, and isolation amongst LGBT and questioning individuals…

The message is clear: some religious groups and their beliefs foster a stigma that leads to high suicide rates. Strange — if religious censure of certain behaviors causes suicide, why aren’t we seeing people who engage in extramarital sexual relations also experiencing astronomical suicide rates? Moreover, as Glenn Stanton has argued, there is no scientific research to substantiate the California legislature’s claim, and the most LGBT-endorsing countries and cities in the world still have disproportionately high rates of suicides among LGBT individuals.

Kids Need to Hear that Suicide Is Never Justified

Certainly the bullying and harassment that students like Ortiz endured can compound feelings of isolation, depression, and self-hatred. But blame also lies at the feet of media, medical practitioners, politicians, and even parents who tell transgender persons, either explicitly or implicitly, that suicide, or attempting suicide, are expected reactions to those feelings.

Rather than address the more uncomfortable possibilities (such as that perhaps rejecting one’s physical anatomy is associated with mental illness), these actors try to shift responsibility to those suspicious or critical of transgender ideology. They appear to believe that if persuading vulnerable youths to contemplate suicide helps persuade the public that skepticism of transgender ideology is dangerously prejudicial and bigoted, so be it.

This does youths like Ortiz a disservice. I attended the same secondary school as Ortiz, though about 20 years before her. I knew a number of kids who, for a variety of reasons, were emotionally vulnerable like her, and targets of harassment and bullying. Tragically, there were multiple suicides in my six years there.

Mental illness is a terribly serious thing, and increasingly affects America’s youth, regardless of sexual or gender identity. Exploiting that trend as a political weapon for policy advantages and bludgeoning one’s adversaries may secure some short-term political victories. But, as more and more stories prove, such tactics create collateral damage, in this case, vulnerable American youths. And that is shameful.

"While LGBT Activists Complain, Grassroots Groups Help LGBT People","Human Rights Campaign President Alphonso David appeared on MSNBC to discuss how the COVID-19 crisis uniquely affects LGBT people in America. Statistics stating 1 in 5 LGBT Americans live in poverty and 40 percent of homeless youth identify as LGBT are well-known, but hearing that an estimated five million LGBT Americans are expected to lose their jobs is striking.

The statistic comes from the website of the LGBT activist organization. It states 40 percent of industries LGBT people are most likely to work in—restaurants, bars, and retail stores—are expected to close down. The website also indicates 17 percent of LGBT Americans lack health insurance.

Yet David’s interview illustrated a huge gap between the organization’s advocacy efforts and the daily lives of LGBT Americans. When asked by the host how lawmakers could protect this group due to the “disproportionate” impact related to industry closings, David argued his concern was whatever is implemented be free from “discrimination.”

He went on to talk about the number of states without LGBT anti-discrimination rules for employment, elaborating, “In some instances are fired from their jobs because they’re gay. Denied housing because they’re transgender. They’re denied public accommodations because they are bisexual.”

A HRC research brief titled, “The Lives and Livelihoods of Many in the LGBTQ Community are at Risk Amidst COVID-19 Crisis” merely argues, “More than 100 LGBTQ-supportive organizations, including the Human Rights Campaign, joined in a call to health care providers and policymakers to be keenly aware of the community’s needs. Underlying many of the LGBTQ communities’ vulnerabilities are economic disparities that will compound the realities of this global pandemic.”

Such assertions simply do not provide insight into how real gay and transgender people are managing currently. While LGBT organizations focus on “awareness” and repeating advocacy-related statistics, where is the direct outreach to real people in need?

Small groups crowdfunding to make a difference appear to be the answer gay and trans people in need are looking for. The Trans Sistas of Color Project in Detroit, Michigan, for example, recently organized to build care packages for LGBT people in need, including homeless people and the elderly, entirely funded from direct donations and volunteer work.

The Okra Project in New York City provides meals to transgender people in need year-round, funded by direct donations and volunteer work. The Our House project in Portland, Oregon, offers health care, housing, and other essentials to people living with HIV, again through direct donations and volunteer work. The Salvation Army has a dedicated page to protecting LGBT Americans during this crisis, offering homeless shelters and homeless youth services.

There are thousands more small and volunteer-based organizations dedicated to helping this population, and many traditional charities doing the same. These organizations bring food, clothing, medicine, and other essentials directly to people in need. They help their communities not through advocacy, but through living alongside the people they assist. Without multi-million-dollar budgets and highly paid advocates going on TV to complain about hypothetical concerns, these people help real people every single day.

The HRC and other LGBT advocacy organizations represent the leftwing belief in government responsibility towards caring for the population. They see a lack of specific laws and guidelines for LGBT people during this crisis as the problem, and assume adding these would be sufficient in ensuring LGBT people are provided for.

For perspective, the HRC and the Human Rights Foundation, both non-profit organizations, reported in 2019 total expenses of operation at nearly $74 million. Yet it is the everyday people, reaching out in their own communities, building from nothing and asking their friends and family to help that is making the biggest, tangible impact.

While LGBT activists and donors may see great value in the work organizations like the HRC do for their political causes, they should take note at the power of charity and community in a time of genuine uncertainty and crisis. This we can all benefit from.

No one was prepared for this crisis, and while people in a variety of different life situations are at more or less immediate risk, everyone is feeling the stress and the uncertainty. While it makes for good headlines, there is no benefit to labeling any particular group “disproportionately” impacted.

What matters is the recognition that we all have to find a way to help each other and that government is simply incapable of stepping in to fix everything. Churches, Facebook groups, small organizations, and so on are the lifeblood of these efforts. It doesn’t need to be any more complicated than that.

4 Times LGBT Media Turned Coronavirus Into Attacks On Christians,"For many on the LGBT left, stemming from the left more broadly, mocking and attacking Christians seems to be the only thing giving them a sense of purpose during the COVID-19 crisis. While it is normal to see headlines from major LGBT sites blasting Christian leaders and denouncing the “anti-LGBT” religious right, April has been particularly inundated with such articles, especially on the most-followed LGBT news site, LGBTQ Nation.

With its 1.5 million followers on Facebook and 163,000 followers on Twitter, LGBTQ Nation holds a great deal of influence among its readers. Here are four of its headlines in the first half of April attacking Christians.

1. ‘Defiant Pastor Who Kept Church Open Despite Coronavirus Warnings Dies a Week Later from COVID-19’

Capitalizing on the recent death of Bishop Gerald O. Glenn of New Deliverance Evangelistic Church near Richmond, Virginia, the article argues, “Misguided preachers nationwide have continued to hold in-person services despite the deadly risk to their congregations, but a Virginia pastor who vowed to keep his church open and to keep preaching ‘unless I’m in jail or the hospital’ has died a week after preaching his defiant service.”

The bishop is quoted as saying, “I firmly believe that God is larger than this dreaded virus,” which was also featured in a tweet and article by The Washington Post, “Prominent Virginia pastor who said ‘God is larger than this dreaded virus’ dies of covid-19,” demonstrating that the mainstream media, not just LGBT media, are perpetuating the anti-religious narrative through their framing.

The New York Times also posted the headline, “Pastor Who Defied Social Distancing Dies After Contracting Covid-19, Church Says.” LGBTQ Nation ends its article, “But a week later, the minister has died from COVID-19. His wife is also sick.”

What they left out, detailed by local news CBS 6 News Richmond, is that the March 22 sermon, regularly aired on the news channel, occurred a day before the state of Virginia officially banned gatherings of 10 or more people. The church has held drive-in sermons since.

The bishop, his daughter says, had a serious underlying health condition. She also described him as someone who loved to greet and hug his congregants whenever he saw them in public. His wife has also tested positive for COVID-19.

2. ‘The Religious Right Has a New Coronavirus Concern: People Are Touching Their No-No Parts’

Mocking several Christian leaders for sharing their concerns about an uptick in pornography, the article quotes the Liberty Counsel, after denouncing it as a “hate group,” saying, “There are many forgotten people who have become collateral damage in these far-reaching lockdowns. We must not forget them, and we must do better to protect the people who are being harmed by the government’s response to COVID-19. Churches are more essential now than before the pandemic.”

Referring to the Family Research Council as a “hate group” as well, the article quotes Tony Perkins as saying, “We cannot afford to let this crisis open the door to a craving that destroys our kids’ innocence and future happiness.”

Despite the article presenting the concerns of Christian leaders as laughable and petty, a recent 2019 study validates them. A cross-sectional study of Polish university students in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health concluded, “In the opinion of the majority of the surveyed students, pornography use may have a negative effect on the quality of social relationships (58.7%), mental health (63.9%) and sexual performance (67.7%), as well as negatively affect psychosocial development in childhood and adolescence (78.1%).”

3. ‘Charity Compares Homosexuality to Drug Addiction to Justify Rejecting LGBTQ Coronavirus Volunteers’

As detailed here, LGBT activists have been aggressively attacking Franklin Graham’s Samaritan’s Purse charity for setting up a desperately needed 68-bed COVID-19 field hospital in Central Park. Quoting an article by the Charlotte Observer, they argue, “He said that opposition to LGBTQ rights is ‘part of who we are,’ but also justified the policy in practical terms. ‘I don’t want a person who is going to be on the job and drinks; that’s not a good witness,’ he said, effectively comparing homosexuality to drug addiction. ‘I don’t want a person who’s going to be using drugs to be part of our team.’”

The primary issue of contention is the Statement of Faith all volunteers must sign to participate in the Christian charity’s activities. Much of the media reporting has cast this as discrimination and “anti-LGBT.”

The referenced Charlotte Observer article, despite its objectionable framing, provides more useful context. Defending the Christian nature of his organization, Graham told the Observer, “Of course, I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. That’s part of who we are. So we have a long list of things we want people to understand and agree with before we take them to work with us.”

In a related article, LGBTQ Nation argued the organization could be discriminating against LGBT patients because an LGBT activist reported calling the organization to offer his volunteer services but pushed the issue of his sexuality and claimed he was “turned away” from the organization. Graham, however, had previously told the Religious News Service, “We don’t discriminate against anybody we help. We provide our services to everyone regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation. We don’t discriminate. Period.”

4. ‘PHOTOS: Hunky Jesus Contest Manages to Resurrect Our Spirits in Challenging Times’

Queerty, the sister site to LGBTQ Nation, highlighted an annual event by the San Francisco Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, the Hunky Jesus and Foxy Mary contests. The contests feature gay men dressed provocatively as both Jesus and Mary (in drag) and have become a “time-honored” celebration in the LGBT community. Mocking the central figures of billions of people worldwide is the group’s Easter tradition.

These are only a few of the dozens of articles mocking Christians: scoffing at their deaths as they advocate faith during the crisis, mocking Vice President Mike Pence, attacking Hobby Lobby and Chick-fil-A, accusing Christians of endangering the public through church services, and attempting to humiliate them during their holiest season. It borders on an obsession and appears to be little more than vindictive and petty exploitation.

People of faith have struggled to adapt to this global crisis as congregating and public worship are vital daily aspects of many religions worldwide. The attempts to suppress any gatherings whatsoever, even when participants are safely in their own cars, has caused many to challenge state orders.

But more than that, people of faith are doing their best to support each other and keep their communities active and alive. Why the left is specifically targeting Christians for shaming and defamation can only be understood as bigotry and prejudice.

As one of the loudest voices in LGBT media, LGBTQ Nation often becomes a catalyst for attitudes within the larger community. Comments on Facebook and Twitter, despite incorrect information within the articles, demonstrate the ease with which the left can be enraged and their bigotry can be validated through headlines. But feeding into this mob mentality by targeting Christians serves no other purpose than to create division and perpetuate hatred.

In a time when our culture has the opportunity to find common ground in our collective experience, we should all reject this kind of relentless stereotyping. Most importantly, the death of anyone as the result of this virus should never be exploited for political gain or social narratives.

Why You Shouldn’t Add The Q To LGBT,"Today, most people are adding the “Q” to LGBT. They shouldn’t, and let me explain why.

Some add the Q through innocent mindlessness. They hear it being referred to in that way and simply repeat it. Innocent mistake.

Others add it intentionally, mistakenly believing doing so is more sensitive, respectful, and enlightened, like using “Asian” rather than “Oriental,” “African-American” over “black,” or “disabled” rather than “handicapped.” This can come from good intentions, but it is ill-informed and unnecessary.

These others are objective, defined groups of people. “LGBT” is not. It is almost inherently subjective.

To be sure, we should care for and be kind to all individuals, regardless of their story. This is what my book, “Loving My LGBT Neighbor,” is about. But we do not have to be respectful of all political and ideological groups. There is a very important difference here. People are people and groups are not.

Not adding the Q to LGBT has to do with some very important particulars of the gay and lesbian movement and its public relations goals. Let’s look at just two of the major ones.

Many Gay People Resist the Alphabet Soup

I’ve had many discussions over the years about the variations of this acronym with gay, lesbian, and trans leaders I count as friends. They express frustration with it, explaining how they and many of their peers have given up deciding what letters should be included in this ever-growing list because no one can agree on them. “Who can keep up anymore, so why even try?” a gay actor from Chicago told me recently.

A long and valued friend of mine in that movement, Jonathan Rauch, wrote a fascinating article for The Atlantic last year on this very question. He explains that some highly influential leaders in this group refuse use “LGBT” or any of its derivatives, not because of confusion, but on principle.

Frank Kameny, who many credit as the father of the gay rights movement, “abjured it.” A friend of Kameny’s explains he realized early on that establishing a truly inclusive moniker for their movement would lead to ridiculousness. “Frank was quite indignant about the alphabet soup. When it started in the ’80s with gay and lesbian, he correctly predicted that there would be no end of it.” This is because there is no clear determination of what should and should not be included in this group.

Rauch is of the conviction that the LGBT train of letters, this “telescoping designation,” should be sent to the rail yard. He believes this, not because it’s unwieldy, imprecise or unhelpful, but because it feeds “the excesses of identity politics” that have poisoned our national discourse.

To illustrate the problem, Rauch wisely asks the alphabet soup advocates to consider this applicable scenario: “Imagine if the religious-liberty movement instead styled itself the CJMHBSBA+ (Catholic-Jewish-Muslim-Hindu-Buddhist-Sikh-Baha’i-Animist-plus) movement. The symbolism ceases to be about equality for all Americans and becomes instead about naming particularistic claimants.”

If gay and lesbian leaders have long given up trying to get the thing right, you and I shouldn’t feel compelled to worry ourselves with it either.

LGBT Refers to Something That Doesn’t Exist

There is no actual LGBT movement, and there is no such a thing as an “LGBT person.” As one friend in that movement told me, “I am not an ‘LGBT person,’ nor is anyone else. No one is a Lesbian-Gay-Bisexual-Transgender-Queer-Questioning person.” In his Atlantic article, Rauch holds that LGBT “is not a label that accurately describes me or any other American. It describes a coalition, yes, but not any actual person.”

Just as the LGBT person does not exist, neither does the movement or the coalition in actuality. LGBTetc. is an ideological and socio-political construct. It certainly does not refer to a unified, naturally occurring people group.

Why? The members of this supposed coalition do not live in solidarity, they are largely not together. They often don’t get along so well and certainly don’t agree on who should and should not be counted as members. Disagreement on this matter is baked into the thing itself. Thus, it is not actually a “thing,” so we should stop pretending it is.

The people lumped into this designation are not always the political or social allies most assume. Many Ls think Gs are too promiscuous. Many Gs are shocked that the Ls get so serious so quickly. Many Ls and Gs believe the Bs should stop pretending and just pick a side already. Many Ls, Gs, and Bs believe the Ts are a curiosity. And most of the other letters never show up at the marches.

A lesbian activist explained it well in the pages of The New York Times, “The gay establishment has always taken ‘L.G.B.T.’ to mean ‘gay, with lesbian in parentheses, throw out the bisexuals, and put trans on for a little bit of window dressing.’” Yes, it all tends to be a bit patriarchal. Ladies, to the back.

There is ample evidence that many members of this supposed coalition don’t wholly respect and stand up for each other. They are, more than not, segregated in practicality and ideology. Those outside their movement should certainly not feel compelled or shamed into acting as if this alphabet soup of disagreed-upon letters is an objective class of people who must be addressed in a certain way. They don’t need to believe using certain letters is being respectful or correct.

Trying to get it right is a fool’s errand, and many non-heterosexual people gave up on it long ago. So should the rest of us.

Samaritan's Purse COVID Clinic Discriminated Against Zero LGBT Patients,"When Samaritan’s Purse, a global evangelical relief organization run by Franklin Graham, began setting up a large emergency field hospital in New York’s Central Park to care for the overflow of COVID-19 patients, a small but brash group of city leaders emphatically said the ministry was not welcome. Its Christian values were at odds with their city.

Apparently, these few assigned themselves the duty of deciding and declaring to everyone else what New York City values. Samaritan’s Purse is a Christian group that takes a biblical and natural view of marriage, that it is between a man and woman. That’s an unacceptable idea in the Big Apple, according to this cadre, and a sympathetic media happily carried these leaders’ dramatic concerns to the masses.

When he learned of Samaritan’s Purse’s arrival at the invitation of Mt. Sinai Hospital, New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson called its leader Franklin Graham “notoriously bigoted” and “hate spewing.”

“This is very disturbing,” Johnson said. “We need reassurances from the city and from Mt. Sinai that Samaritan’s Purse and its volunteers will be monitored, and that the LGBTQ community will not be discriminated against in any way.”

Gotham’s Mayor Bill de Blasio and other city leaders dispatched the New York City Commission on Human Rights to closely monitor Samaritan’s Purse to ensure anyone who identified as gay, lesbian, or transgender would not be mistreated or turned away.

News site AMNY confidently warned it was “clear that Samaritan’s Purse intends to inject its religious beliefs into the organization’s work, raising more red flags about the group’s intentions in Central Park.” It quoted Kelli Dunham, whom the site described as a “genderqueer comedian and author.” Dunham was freaked by the ministry’s arrival, saying, “This is scary as hell. In order to volunteer with this organization, you have to affirm their anti-LGBT and anti-trans statement of belief.” Dunham added, “Well it didn’t take too long into the pandemic to throw queer folks under the bus!”

Such comments were plentiful and circulated widely by many publications. A reader unfamiliar with the hair-trigger, victim-laden rhetoric of many in the gay and lesbian movement would have thought Samaritan’s Purse’s arrival in NYC would be as bad as the plague. Yet after having cared for their last of the 333 Wuhan virus patients they served since April 1, Samaritan’s Purse broke camp last week, with all volunteers heading home.

No Discrimination Was Reported

So what actually happened in the midst of these dramatic accusations of bigotry and homophobia? Just how many gays and lesbians did Samaritan’s Purse turn away or mistreat?

The number is rather anti-climactic for these activists. No media organization — not The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Village Voice, the numerous LGBT print or online publications, nor the New York City Human Rights Commission itself — documented any case of any patient being turned away from Samaritan’s Purse’s services because of religious belief or sexual desire. No record existes of anyone being denied care for any reason. Everyone who needed help got it, no questions asked.

The New Times even noted, “On Friday afternoon, the City’s Commission on Human Rights closed an investigation into the [Samaritan’s Purse] hospital after finding no evidence it had discriminated against patients, according to its press secretary, Alicia McCauley.”

There was no evidence of any kind of discrimination. No journalist or watchdog group could document any patient complaining of caregivers forcing any unwanted Christian beliefs or practices upon them. The New York Times reported this was a deep concern because “the organization’s slogan, ‘Helping in Jesus’ name,’ was on trucks outside the field hospital and Mr. Graham delivered an Easter sermon on Fox News from the site.” For the good people at The Times, apparently “helping in Jesus’ name” means forcing people to listen to sermonizing.

Samaritan’s Purse workers sometimes asked patients if they wanted to be prayed for while receiving medical care. It’s what Christians do. No patients balked at the offer, nor complained they were being cared for by a distinctly Christian organization. Rather, New Yorkers were glad someone outside their city would disrupt their own lives and put themselves at risk just to help perfect strangers.

NYC Was Lucky to Have Samaritan’s Purse

If you believe Samaritan’s Purse didn’t live up to the nasty hype simply because they were being monitored, you are acutely cynical. Your prejudice is preventing you from bothering to find out how such organizations actually work and who they are committed to serving. You would find it’s precisely because of their Christian faith that they serve anyone and everyone in need.

At the very end of its article on the ministry’s wind-down in New York City, The New York Times did conclude that New Yorkers seemed more than pleased that Samaritan’s Purse was there:

[T]he controversy did not affect the daily routine of the field hospital. Workers there said they had been warmly welcomed by New Yorkers, who sent food and gathered to cheer for them at 7 p.m.

The Times quoted Jill Pike, a 30-year old woman who traveled from Oregon to volunteer. “We have been so well loved here, truly,” Pike said.

Of course, that the media found no trace of discrimination is no surprise to most people, who understand that Christian service organizations help all in need, regardless. For all the fear and loathing in NYC by a small, politically motivated group, Samaritan’s Purse’s presence resulted in nothing more than 333 total patients receiving excellent medical care in a time of great need.

Some of those happy, thankful, and now healthy patients were no doubt gay, lesbian, or transgender. They could tell you firsthand how kindly they were treated and cared for, no differently than anyone else. They will tell you that their supposed defenders’ dramatic concerns turned out to be profoundly unfounded.

SCOTUS’s Transgender Ruling Firebombs The Constitution,"In Monday’s ruling inserting “gender identity” into the word “sex” in a 1964 employment law, the U.S. Supreme Court called a man a woman, possibly leading to eventually forcing everyone else to do so also. The ruling will lead to a tsunami of polarizing court cases and further degradation of Americans’ natural rights to free speech, to free association, and to worshipping God as their consciences require. All this in the name of “equality,” a word that has become a totalitarian weapon.

The 6-3 majority included Chief Justice John Roberts, appointed by Republican President George W. Bush, and Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch, appointed by Republican President Donald Trump. These presidents promised voters their justices would uphold the rule of law and the Constitution, and were elected in significant part based on these now-broken promises.

This decision is a disgrace to these bedrocks of Western civilization, our nation built upon them, the voters who vote for them, and to these men’s honor. President Trump ran promising judges who wouldn’t murder America, and Gorsuch just gave him and everyone who voted for him a giant middle finger. The court’s newfound weakness will also be exploited and explored by leftist legal agitators whose goal is the destruction of the American system.

“There is only one word for what the Court has done today: legislation,” writes Justice Samuel Alito in a dissent Justice Clarence Thomas joined. “…A more brazen abuse of our authority to interpret statutes is hard to recall.”

Open ‘Sex,’ Insert Queer Theory

“An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids,” Gorsuch wrote in the majority opinion. Alito torches this argument in numerous ways. Here’s just one:

At oral argument, the attorney representing the employees, a prominent professor of constitutional law, was asked if there would be discrimination because of sex if an employer with a blanket policy against hiring gays, lesbians, and transgender individuals implemented that policy without knowing the biological sex of any job applicants. Her candid answer was that this would ‘not’ be sex discrimination. And she was right.

“Those who adopted the Civil Rights Act might not have anticipated their work would lead to this particular result… [But] [w]hen the express terms of a statute give us one answer and extratextual considerations suggest another, it’s no contest,” Gorsuch asininely claims: You simply rewrite the “express terms of the statute” as a majority of justices please, just as the Supreme Court did in Roe v. Wade, and reason your way backwards into a politically predetermined conclusion no matter the meanings of the words Congress thought they were writing into law. “Sex” therefore transforms into “sexual orientation and gender identity,” concepts unknown when the 1964 law was passed.

“The precedents set here will have major implications… This will mean that legislators actually won’t know what they are voting to pass—because words might change cultural meaning dramatically between the time of passage and some future court case,” writes Russell Moore, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission.

Courts are not supposed to legislate because citizens cannot consent to legislation imposed by courts, and have no direct means for altering Supreme Court decisions like we can alter laws through our elected representatives. When courts legislate, they disenfranchise the people. They invalidate our votes, our God-given natural right to rule ourselves. By adding words to statute that Congress did not put there, and has repeatedly and explicitly refused to add, these judges are destroying our Constitution, our way of life, the people’s sovereignty, and thus our human dignity.

Making War on Real Rights With Fake Ones

This is a salient example of what Christopher Caldwell calls the United States’ second constitution, which is at war with its first: the identity politics laws and regulations passed largely since the 1960s in the name of “antidiscrimination.”

“Just as assuming that two parallel lines can meet overturns the whole of Euclidean geometry, eliminating freedom of association from the U.S. Constitution changed everything,” Caldwell writes in “Age of Entitlement.” At the time, it wasn’t obvious how “extra rights” could destroy natural rights. But it is now.

As Alito notes, the Supreme Court’s addition of “gender identity” to protected employment classes may cause lawsuits claiming “that the failure to use [transgender people’s] preferred pronoun violates one of the federal laws prohibiting sex discrimination. The Court’s decision may also pressure employers to suppress any statements by employees expressing disapproval of same-sex relationships and sex reassignment procedures.”

In other words, “antidiscrimination” and free speech cannot coexist. Neither can legal identity privileges coexist with freedom of association: “if a religious school teaches that sex outside marriage and sex reassignment procedures are immoral, the message may be lost if the school employs a teacher who is in a same-sex relationship or has undergone or is undergoing sex reassignment. Yet today’s decision may lead to Title VII claims by such teachers and applicants for employment,” writes Alito.

Given all that has happened after Obergefell v. Hodges, which we were vociferously told was ridiculous to forecast — transgenderism immediately going mainstream, pushing religion inside the closet LGBT people were vacating, limiting people’s ability to freely express their faith and ideas, forcing education institutions to promote LGBT politics and behavior — it’s naive to think such scenarios will not quickly become reality as a result of this court decision.

Get Ready for Years of Legal Battles

This decision also cements public schools’ status as social enforcers and subsidizers of far-left politics, as they can have no potential legal defense against a teacher switching genders in front of students, putting boys in girls’ locker rooms and sports, or teaching preschoolers that Heather can have two or even three mommies. Queer theory is now reigning U.S. employment law. This means it must also dominate all institutions of higher education that are not explicitly religious, both public and private.

Religious schools and homeschooling now offer the only potential safe haven to parents who don’t want their children indoctrinated to believe it’s awesome to amputate healthy penises and breasts. Even those options are under threat, and it will take oodles of litigation to work out the details.

Rod Dreher has more on this: “John Bursch of Alliance Defending Freedom, which represented one of the losing plaintiffs in one of the SCOTUS cases, …points out that religious liberty is still very much in play, and will be at issue in future cases. But what SCOTUS has done today is to redefine ‘sex’ to include ‘sexual orientation and gender identity.’ Because of that, he said, ‘there is no end in sight to that kind of litigation.'”

This is litigation LGBT activists are very well-prepared, motivated, and well-financed to pursue. Given Republican politicians’ history of cravenly sacrificing Americans’ constitutional rights to gaslighting from identity politics agitators who don’t vote for Republicans, most notably when Vice President Mike Pence was governor of Indiana, we’d all better redirect any donation from Republican campaigns to legal protection like ADF and The Becket Fund.

We Need Lots More than Judges From Republicans

This is a time to redouble pressure on Republicans to stop helping Democrats shred the Constitution and Americans’ natural rights, withdrawing support from them if they do not. This decision makes Congress irrelevant, unless they decide to make themselves relevant again by eliminating the underlying law on which this decision is based.

The last century of abdicating their responsibilities when in power shows Republicans are not keen on defending our rights. They’d prefer to give rousing speeches about our rights at conventions like CPAC while scapegoating our continued loss of these rights on the judges and the bureaucracy they’re supposed to oversee. That needs to end, and for it to end, all constitutional hypocrites need to be made uncomfortable until they do the right thing.

We must learn how to be effective in expressing our ideas. People need to frequently contact their representatives about this issue, and get on the email lists of state and national groups working on this issue — like Mass Resistance, the Hands Across the Aisle Coalition, the Americian Family Association, Family Research Council, 4thWaveNow, and Transgender Trend — to read up on this issue and take action on bills.

All elected officials and candidates need to start being asked in public, on videos immediately posted to social media, why they aren’t doing anything to keep naked men from getting access to naked girls in showers, bathrooms, and locker rooms. Republicans need to be asked how they can tell us to vote for them “because judges” when their Supreme Court nominees just passed an LGBT version of Roe v. Wade that will lead to teaching preschoolers the confusing, anti-science lie that “boys can have girl brains.”

They need to be asked on camera whether they support the Constitution’s unconditional guarantees of freedom of association, freedom of speech, and the freedom to worship, and if not, how they can take an oath of office swearing fealty to that Constitution. They should be asked how they can justify not voting to eliminate Title VII now that the Supreme Court has made it a Trojan horse for forcing lingerie shops to hire men to fit women’s bras and female beauticians to wax a man’s genitals. They should be asked what effective steps they are taking to ensure that taxpayer dollars do not finance genital mutilation, and that medical and therapeutic professionals lose their licenses if they mutilate the healthy bodies of underage boys and girls.

They should also be asked these questions in private from major donors, and primaried out of office when they answer the wrong way. Campaign donors’ businesses should be boycotted if they do not withdraw support for Republicans who can’t tell the difference between a man and a woman.

Fighting this may not work. That two-thirds of our nation’s highest court clearly despise the Constitution and the way of life it protects, and which it is their sole job to defend, may be yet another indication that the United States we know and love is heading into a dark night of oblivion, like all empires before it. If that is the case, however, I’m going down fighting as hard as I can.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/16/scotuss-transgender-ruling-firebombs-the-constitution/,2020-06-16
SCOTUS Validates LGBT Protections On Grounds LGBT Activists Reject,"Is Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, which ruled LGBT discrimination in employment violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a groundbreaking and historic victory for LGBT Americans? Possibly.

On the surface, the ruling seems to address one of the most commonly voiced concerns for LGBT rights in America: employment discrimination. With some states protecting LGBT people from employment discrimination and others not, the argument has long been that one can “still be fired for being gay.” This ruling effectively makes discrimination based on LGBT status illegal nationwide, although nowhere in America has the law argued in favor of this discrimination.

While 91 percent of Fortune 500 companies already self-regulate against discrimination based on sexual orientation and 83 percent on gender identity, it has long been argued that employment discrimination is an immediate threat to LGBT people. As Lambda Legal tweeted, quoting its CEO Kevin Jennings, “In many ways this is an even bigger decision than the Obergefell decision that came down five years ago. Not everyone will want to get married, but everybody has to have a job.”

However, an important aspect of this ruling may negatively affect LGBT advocacy about transgender rights and social acceptance.

Decision Could Come Back to Bite the LGBT Cause

In the 6-3 opinion, wherein Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch sided with the four leftist justices, Gorsuch wrote, “An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.”

Yet only days ago, J.K. Rowling was accused of transphobia for saying biological sex is, indeed, real. Rowling tweeted June 6, “If sex isn’t real, there’s no same-sex attraction. If sex isn’t real, the lived reality of women globally is erased. I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives. It isn’t hate to speak the truth.”

It seemed the whole of LGBT advocacy, media, and Hollywood, including prominent actors in the Harry Potter films, descended onto Rowling to denounce her. In recent years, the argument that biological sex, male and female, is unscientific has gained steam in left-wing and LGBT advocacy. George Takei, for example, recently declared, “When you defend so-called ‘biological sex,’ you sound scientifically ignorant and you elevate transphobia.”

The Supreme Court ruling, celebrated as historic for LGBT rights, appears to agree with Rowling’s argument. In order to base gay and transgender rights on the assumption of sex protections, sex itself must be objectively defined. If sex is fluid or subjective, this ruling leaves nothing for LGBT advocates to hold onto.

The ruling assumes sex and then works backward, arguing sexual orientation and gender identity must be protected, based on the assumptions made about sex. If the transgender argument — that sex is mutable — is to be considered factual, the ruling becomes invalid.

By linking the rights of gay and transgender people to sex, the LGBT left has bound itself to whatever definition “sex” takes on. The more fluid and subjective it becomes, the less firm and predictable rights for gay and transgender people will become. For now, this does not seem to be a concern or even a consideration, as all they can see is victory. But they rarely think these things through to their logical conclusions.

Threatens Religious Liberty and Separation of Powers

Is this a defeat for President Trump, as CNN bluntly declared? Advocates of separation of powers are concerned. As Justice Brett Kavanaugh described in his dissent:

In the face of the unsuccessful legislative efforts (so far) to prohibit sexual orientation discrimination, judges may not rewrite the law simply because of their own policy views. Judges may not update the law merely because they think that Congress does not have the votes or the fortitude. Judges may not predictively amend the law just because they believe that Congress is likely to do it soon anyway.

This ruling threatens religious liberty as well. Religious schools of any number of faiths are designed to instill a specific way of life, which is why many parents send their children. Is it reasonable for a religious school to determine that an openly gay or transgender teacher presents a moral conflict at odds with the school’s teaching? Up until now, this was not a question for the government to decide. That may no longer be the case.

As for its perceived benefit, the ability to sue employers for discrimination will almost certainly lead to abusive demands by LGBT advocates with ever-growing demands of what constitutes “discrimination.” Symbolically, it is certainly a superficial victory for LGBT advocates who obtain personal validation by grand, public declarations of support and acceptance. But as is typical, the left ignores the potential consequences of their impatience.

Lawyers Already Using Trans Ruling To Demand Hysterectomies For Men,"The Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia is but two weeks old, and the mischief has already begun. Last week the leftist group Lambda Legal Defense filed suit against the Trump administration, arguing the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS’) recent regulations interpreting the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA’s) prohibition on sex discrimination violates Bostock’s holding that transgender discrimination is illegal sex discrimination. Not only is Lambda wrong, its lawsuit proves Bostock was wrong too.

Writing for the five-justice majority in Bostock, Justice Neil Gorsuch twisted his way through a series of hypotheticals to conclude that “when an employer fires an employee for being homosexual or transgender, it necessarily and intentionally discriminates against that individual in part because of sex.” Thus, according to the Bostock court, “it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.”

Thanks for All the New Lawsuits, Neil Gorsuch!

While Bostock addressed the meaning of “sex discrimination” within the context of Title VII’s employment discrimination statute, in its lawsuit filed last week against the Trump administration, Lambda relies on Gorsuch’s language to challenge the HHS’s newly released regulations that address Section 1557 of the ACA.

Section 1557 prohibits discrimination “on the basis of . . . sex” in “health programs and activities.” President Obama’s HHS had left the meaning of this phrase undefined for the first six years following the ACA’s passage, but in the final year of his presidency, his HHS team promulgated regulations that defined discrimination “on the basis of . . . sex” to include “discrimination on the basis of sex stereotyping, and gender identity.”

The 2016 HHS regulations further defined “gender identity” as “an individual’s internal sense of gender, which may be male, female, neither, or a combination of male and female, and which may be different from an individual’s sex assigned at birth.”

The Obama HHS went further, with the 2016 regulations mandating that health insurance providers and employee benefits plans “treat individuals consistent with their gender identity.” The 2016 regulations also barred covered insurers from adopting “a categorical coverage exclusion or limitation for all health care services related to gender transition,” claiming that such an exclusion would be “discriminatory on its face.”

HHS rescinded these regulations mere days before the Bostock decision, with the new regulations deleting the Obama administration’s definition of “sex” for purposes of the ACA. Also eliminated were the mandates that health-care providers “treat individuals consistent with their gender identity,” and that insurance companies cover “transition-related services.” No contrary regulations were added, however, with Trump’s HHS merely eliminating what Obama’s team had done, leaving the term “sex” undefined, as it is in Title VII and the ACA.

Trump Admin’s Return to Sanity Isn’t Discrimination

While Lambda, on behalf of a sprawling group of plaintiffs including several physicians and activist organizations, claims HHS’s deletion of “sex stereotyping and gender identity” from the regulatory definition of sex discrimination conflicts with the holding of Bostock, it does not.

In Bostock, the Supreme Court majority bypassed the question of what “sex” means, noting that the employers had maintained that “sex” referred to “status as either male or female [as] determined by reproductive biology,” while the plaintiffs argued “the term bore a broader scope, capturing more than anatomy and reaching at least some norms concerning gender identity and sexual orientation.”

The majority, though, found no reason to decide the question and instead “proceed[ed] on the assumption that ‘sex’ . . . referred only to biological distinctions between male and female.” Thus, Bostock does not stand for the proposition that “sex” means “gender identity” for purposes of Title VII, much less as used in the ACA.

Nonetheless, because the Bostock court concluded that “it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex,” Lambda argues the ACA prohibits discrimination based on “gender identity.” But here Lambda faces an initial challenge: the newly released regulations do not address whether discrimination based on “gender identity” is illegal. Rather, the regulations are silent on the question, so they cannot possibly violate Bostock.

Lambda’s complaint skims over this defect by arguing that HHS’s elimination of “gender identity” from the definition of sex discrimination “not only invites health care insurers and providers to discriminate against LGBTQ people seeking health care, but it also introduces substantial confusion among health care providers and insurers regarding their legal obligations and the right of the populations they serve to be free from sex discrimination . . .”

In responding to Lambda’s complaint, HHS will likely argue that the new regulations cannot be challenged for something they do not say, and that the court should wait for a live controversy to interpret the meaning of “sex discrimination” for purposes of the ACA.

Give This Man a Hysterectomy, Stat!

The second problem with Lambda’s legal argument is more fundamental and proves fatal, whether a court considers the question now or waits until there is an actual controversy in a future case: what Lambda portrays as discrimination based on gender identity is not sex discrimination under the reasoning of Bostock.

Specifically, Lambda argues in its complaint that HHS’s revised rules will result in “increased discrimination by health plans, particularly against persons seeking gender-affirming care.” Examples of such “gender-affirming care” that health plans might discriminatorily deny transgender persons, according to Lambda, include “hair transplant, scalp advancement, brow reduction, lip reduction or augmentation, rhinoplasty, check and chin contouring, jawline modification, blepharoplasty, or other facial feminization techniques”; “laser hair removal and electrolysis, on the face and elsewhere on the body”; “surgeries involving the neck, such as cartilage reduction (modification of the Adam’s Apple) and vocal feminization surgery”; “breast augmentation and reduction”; “other body contouring procedures, such as waist reduction, hip/buttocks implants, at transfer, pectoral implants”; and “lessons/training to modify the vocal range.”

Denying transgender people coverage for these procedures is not discrimination, much less sex discrimination. While the Obama administration’s 2016 regulations barred covered insurers from adopting “a categorical coverage exclusion or limitation for all health care services related to gender transition,” claiming that such an exclusion would be “discriminatory on its face,” Bostock’s reasoning establishes the contrary—that there is no sex discrimination in play. In fact, in attempting to apply Bostock reasoning in the context of a health-care case exposes the fundamental fallacy underlying the Supreme Court’s reasoning: that men and women are indistinguishable.

Also, Give Sarah a Fake Penis

Let’s start with the latter point and apply Bostock’s reasoning. In Bostock, in analyzing whether a transgender employee was a victim of sex discrimination, the Supreme Court explained that “if changing the employee’s sex would have yielded a different choice by the employer-a statutory violation has occurred.”

Now, we’ll apply this standard in the context of health insurance coverage or medical care, with a hypothetical woman, Sarah, who suffers from gender dysphoria. Sarah asks her doctor to remove her uterus, but her doctor refuses because Sarah’s uterus is healthy. Sarah’s health insurance company also refuses to pay for the removal of a healthy uterus. Did Sarah’s doctor and health insurance company discriminate against Sarah on the basis of her sex?

No. If Sarah were a man, the doctor would have likewise have refused to remove his . . . uterus? It doesn’t work! Bostock makes no sense when applied in realm of sex-based distinctions.

It is all well and good for the Supreme Court to speak—as it did in Bostock—of traits or activities that an employer would find acceptable for a woman, but not for a man. But there are real differences between men and women, and the Supreme Court’s test ignored that reality.

Failing the Test of Reality

Moreover, even if we manipulate the Supreme Court’s test to accommodate the biological differences between men and women, the result remains: no discrimination. Why? Because if a man asked his doctor to remove his healthy testicles, the doctor would refuse, and coverage would be denied.

Now, going further with the hypothetical, there is also no discrimination because Sarah is transgender. That’s because if another woman who is not transgender asked her doctor to remove her healthy uterus, the doctor would refuse as well.

Change healthy uterus for any of the other “gender-affirming” procedures Lambda claims doctors must perform and health insurance companies must cover, and the result is the same. There is no discrimination. There is no sex discrimination. And there is no transgender discrimination.

But what about the Obama administration’s regulatory mandate that health-care providers “treat individuals consistent with their gender identity”? The newly released HHS regulations rescind that regulation as well. So, will a health-care provider discriminate on the basis of sex under Bostock if the medical caregiver does not treat an individual “consistent with” his or her “gender identity”?

You’re a Bigot If You Don’t Check Men for Cervical Cancer

Revisiting Sarah, our hypothetical woman suffering from gender dysphoria, provides the answer—and the answer is that Bostock is nonsense. Consider, for instance, how a doctor would treat Sarah consistent with her gender identity—that of a male. The doctor would check her prostate, test for signs of testicular cancer, and not perform a cervical examination. And it would be considered discrimination under Bostock if the doctor didn’t (or did) do these sex-based examinations.

After all, Bostock tells us that “if changing the employee’s sex would have yielded a different choice by the employer-a statutory violation has occurred,” and if Sarah were a man, the doctor would have performed a prostate exam and would not have performed a cervical exam. Voila: sex discrimination.

Of course, this is ridiculous, because Sarah is a woman, and not a man, no matter what gender she identifies as. But that doesn’t matter under Bostock, because the court adopted a standard that ignores all biological sex-based distinctions, and purposefully put to the side questions of pronouns, bathrooms, and locker rooms.

Justice Gorsuch had to, though, because when you bring in biological sex-based distinctions, it becomes clear that you are no longer talking about stereotypical traits and actions; and you are no longer talking about a man who is treated differently because he is perceived as too feminine, or a woman discriminated against for a too masculine aura. You are talking about a man who claims to be a woman or a woman who claims to be a man and who demands others—whether they be employers, teachers, or doctors—affirm a lie. You are talking about transgender individuals.

The Supreme Court could obfuscate that reality in Bostock, but Lambda’s lawsuit exposes, not just how extreme the Obama administration was, but how extreme the Supreme Court’s decision was. And when “sex” meets science, Justice Gorsuch will have some serious explaining to do.

"LGBT Activists Should Seek To Win Debates, Not Coercive Court Cases","America is convulsing in pain. We’re just over halfway through 2020 and the world has experienced a crippling pandemic, a debilitated economy, and mass outrage over the murder of George Floyd. Amid the chaos, however, a recent decision from the U.S. Supreme Court has given hope to many in the LGBT community.

In mid-June, Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch shocked the nation by authoring the majority opinion of a 6-3 vote that banned employers from discriminating against LGBT employees. Needless to say, LGBT activists across the country rejoiced over this gift — which happened to occur during Pride month, no less. Meanwhile, several conservatives scorned Gorsuch for a flawed textualist interpretation of the Constitution.

But the general consensus is clear, even from voices like dissenting conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who said gay Americans can “take pride” in the ruling’s result. The ruling is heralded as a win for LGBT tolerance. But still, I’m left asking: Is it? Is tolerance truly best achieved by force or by persuasion?

Naturally, I’m happy that my continued professional livelihood as a gay man just became a bit more certain. Yet, if we think about it, the recent SCOTUS decision in Bostock v. Clayton County does very little to address genuine instances of homophobic biases.

After all, it can’t. All it has done is buried these prejudices under legalese. SCOTUS’s ruling may have excited LGBT allies, but it certainly didn’t change the hearts and minds of homophobic business owners.

Ultimately, we have to acknowledge how this ruling will be detrimental to LGBT folks. Now, instead of having a clear idea of what their employer thinks, gay folks will be subject to latent discrimination that will be quite difficult to prove, much less fight. Whereas a homophobic business owner could be boycotted if her views came to light, they’re now much more likely to flourish in the dark, and I might unknowingly become employed by one of them.

History can be a great teacher here if we listen to her. The Stonewall Riots, for example, were the precursor to several social organizations that advocate for tolerance. In the late 1960s, Stonewall Inn was a haven for socially marginalized individuals who sought companionship. In a world that despised them, gay people found comfort among like-minded souls.

Their peace was routinely interrupted, however, by vile police raids, which provoked Stonewall’s patrons to yell “Enough!” Thus, the Stonewall Riots were born.

Observers of the Stonewall incident often focus on the riots. What is not often discussed, however, is the sophisticated network of social organizations from Stonewall’s example that advanced perspectives on LGBT matters.

On June 28, 1970, the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots, everything changed. The first gay pride parade — which was more of a political statement than a celebration — ricocheted through the cultural landscape of the 1970s. The parade marched from the solemn grounds of Stonewall down to Central Park and straight into the media limelight, with the headline “Thousands of Homosexuals Hold A Protest Rally in Central Park” splashed across the front page of The New York Times.

Shortly thereafter, pride movements popped up around the nation. In places like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago, hundreds of gay demonstrators had one unifying message: We will be treated equally.

This gospel of acceptance and equality persisted, and ultimately changed perspectives. A 2019 study conducted by the Annual Review of Sociology shows the relationship between persuasion and this ideological shift.

In 1973, for example, only 10 percent of Americans thought homosexual relations were not wrong. By the 2000s, the study found, that perspective had doubled. Similarly, in 1989, only 42 percent of Americans supported hiring homosexuals as elementary school teachers. In 2007, 70 percent of Americans supported that proposition — a figure that’s certainly grown even more over the years. I really would rather work for someone in that 70 percent.

None of these perspectives were delivered by the Supreme Court’s stamp of approval or by significant governmental support. Quite the opposite, in fact, as during the first part of the 2000s, political actors in the federal government sought to constitutionally prohibit gay marriage.

Ultimately, the social acceptance of gay individuals emerged from years of dedicated social messaging and nonprofit work. Regular people — not justices and certainly not government bureaucrats — created a safer world for gay men like me. In the final analysis, that’s a strategy gay activists must pursue in the future if we want genuine change.

So, go ahead, celebrate the court’s sentiments and its recent Bostock pronouncement. But, in that jubilation, let’s not forget that we have the power to shape our world. It’ll take a lot more than a gavel slam from a judge to change the minds of the remaining bigots in society. In the meantime, I don’t want to unwittingly work for one.

Pressuring Halle Berry To Resign From Trans Role Typecasts LGBT Actors,"Halle Berry became the first black woman to win an Oscar for Best Actress in 2001 for her role in “Monster’s Ball.” In 2020, however, Berry found herself bullied into apologizing for accepting a role to play a transgender man in a movie, turning it down after backlash from LGBT activists.

“Over the weekend I had the opportunity to discuss my consideration of an upcoming role as a transgender man, and I’d like to apologize for those remarks,” Berry posted on her social media. “As a cisgender woman, I now understand that I should not have considered this role, and that the transgender community should undeniably have the opportunity to tell their own stories.”

Despite her apology, LGBT media complained that beforehand, while describing the upcoming role, Berry had “misgendered” the character and called it a “female” story she felt was important to tell. Berry had previously said, “Who this woman was is so interesting to me, and that will probably be my next project, and that will require me cutting all of my hair off.”

She continued, “It changes to a man, but I want to understand the why and how of that. I want to get into it.” The role involved the character transitioning, which would make a female actor going through the process seem reasonable.

The backlash came not only from Berry being a cisgender actor — meaning one who lives consistently with her sex — but also her mistake in referring to a biological female as “she” prior to transition. The resounding argument was that only transgender actors should play transgender characters or, as Berry expressed, “tell their own stories.” This argument undermines much of not only Berry’s career but LGBT representation in media until recently.

Actors Are Supposed to Act

In 2002, after winning her Oscar, Berry lamented that her win meant nothing. It was groundbreaking at the time, but a year later she said she hoped her win would open opportunities for other black actors to portray characters that are not specifically black. She argued black actors are still required to play stereotypes and other common tropes rather than expanding into unique characters beyond racial context or limitations. Yet nearly 20 years later, Berry finds herself apologizing for daring to take on such a role.

Why was this necessary? While some stories, such as “Orange Is the New Black” and “Sense8,” featured transgender actors playing transgender characters with specific transgender storylines, other popular favorites, such as “American Horror Story,” created by LGBT mogul Ryan Murphy, have challenged this standard.

In “American Horror Story: Hotel,” gay actor Denis O’Hare played a transgender woman named Elizabeth Taylor who lived and identified as a woman but never transitioned. The role challenged the conflict between O’Hare as a man dressed as a woman and convinced the audience to believe his character was, indeed, a woman.

In “American Horror Story: Cult,” Chaz Bono, a biological woman who lives as a man and is the only child of Cher, portrayed two heterosexual male characters, one of which was a Trump supporter. In “American Horror Story: 1984,” Angelica Ross, a biological man who identifies as a woman, played a main character who was simply assumed to be a gender-natural heterosexual woman. This was assumed because those aspects of Ross’ identity were irrelevant to the depth and interest of the character. Had the audience not known Bono and Ross were transgender in real life, it never would have been apparent.

Which is more effective representation: A trans actor playing a trans character with a trans-related story? Or trans actors playing unique and interesting roles without their personal lives overlapping? “American Horror Story” has done similar things with gay and straight characters and actors, with both gay and straight actors playing opposite roles in various seasons, always without controversy. Why? Because the audience cares only for the character and the story. The actor’s personal life rarely matters.

Halle Berry Capitulates to LGBT Hypocrites

What Berry complained of in 2002 is what she is helping to promote in 2020. By arguing that characters must be played by actors who share their inherent characteristics, the left is effectively limiting possibilities for minority actors. While a great deal of hypocrisy exists regarding gay or trans actors portraying straight characters, this movement is effectively restricting opportunity rather than expanding it.

Berry, who has played dozens of iconic characters in many genres, would have been highly effectual in portraying a sympathetic trans story. By arrogantly demanding Hollywood restrict roles in such superficial ways, the LGBT left is effectively limiting the number of chances for their stories to be viewed in the mainstream, portrayed by popular and influential actors. No one wins in this situation.

Of course, the point of acting is to convincingly portray a character to the audience. The actor’s real life should not matter. Berry and other minority actors understood this when they were fighting for access to roles otherwise considered exclusive to white or male actors. Today, they sheepishly bow to the identity-obsessed left and signal their virtue by “offering” their role to actors who more closely resemble the character they otherwise were the best person to play.

"Conservatives Win In Poland, And Leftist Media Calls It Bigotry","Polish President Andrzej Duda of the Law and Justice Party (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość, or PiS) won a narrow reelection, according to results announced Monday.

The victory is significant for PiS, which lost control of Poland’s upper house, the Senate, to the opposition in parliamentary elections last October (the party’s ruling coalition still narrowly controls the lower house, the Sejm). Voter turnout was more than 68 percent, the highest for a presidential poll in Poland in 25 years, indicating PiS maintains a mandate from Poland’s electorate.

Indeed, in the first round of the election on June 30, Duda demonstrated a 13-point edge over his opponent, Rafał Trzaskowski, the mayor of the country’s capital of Warsaw.

Mainstream Media Smears Duda

According to mainstream leftist media, only one narrative about the Polish presidential election news was worth exploring. “Polish president Duda narrowly wins reelection, enabling the continuation of a far-right agenda,” the Washington Post reported. PiS, the Post claims, “undermines democracy.”

“Duda ran a campaign especially notable for its anti-LGBT rhetoric,” the Post continued, smearing Duda’s party as bigots. “He proposed a constitutional amendment that would bar single-sex couples from adopting children and at one point suggested that efforts to advance gay rights were worse than communism.”

These same media outlets claim that this is only one manifestation of Duda’s totalitarian tendencies. For years, PiS has been seeking to “tighten its grip” on the country’s judiciary, according to CNN. Indeed, the EU in 2019 in a “Letter of Formal Notice,” accused Duda’s government of undermining “the judicial independence of Polish judges by not offering necessary guarantees to protect them from political control.” This included a 2018 government reform lowering the age of retirement for Supreme Court judges.

From anti-LGBT bigotry and attacks on judicial independence to anti-immigration rhetoric and “right-wing nationalism” — in the eyes of Western mainstream media, Duda and PiS are no less than a 21st-century manifestation of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. Not even the handsome and charismatic Trzaskowski can curb the country’s descent toward devolutionary totalitarianism. Is this description an accurate representation of Polish politics in 2020?

Context Is Key

Any “anti-LGBT” rhetoric uttered by Duda and his political allies has to be understood in context of broader Polish political trends, says Polish journalist Filip Mazurczak. Pro-LGBT events across the country have often included the mocking of Catholicism’s sacred symbols, and Poland is about 93 percent Catholic. Although the gay pride parade in Warsaw is often well-attended, the same parades elicit crickets elsewhere. In the town of Zabrze, which has a population of 170,000, only one person attended the 2019 LGBT parade.

Law and Justice, in turn, has defended traditional Polish family and Christian values, sought to blunt attempts to scuttle optional religious classes in public schools, and terminated state subsidies for in-vitro fertilization. Such policies seem popular: In the 2019 parliamentary elections, about 60 percent of Poles voted for socially conservative parties. Let’s also not forget gay people didn’t get the power to adopt in the United Kingdom until 2002, while Florida was the last state to give this right in 2010. America was evenly divided on this topic as recently as 2003.

What about the alleged authoritarian intervention in the judiciary? Discussions of this typically fail to mention that the party in power prior to PiS, Civic Platform, in anticipation of its impending defeat, nominated five justices for positions on the Constitutional Court that were to become vacant after elections. This was a breach of a long-established practice of not nominating key positions directly before an election.

The Polish judiciary has historically wielded tremendous, unchecked authority largely free of government oversight, and there are no impeachment procedures for judges. “Judges recruit judges into the judiciary. Judges then elevate judges to higher positions in the judiciary. And judges are supposed to hold other judges accountable for their misdeeds,” noted economist Pawel Dobrowolski and journalist Matthew Tyrmand in 2018.

Moreover, many of these judges were connected to the Communist Party prior to 1989. Many argue that PiS’s judicial reforms would actually make Poland’s separation of powers more like America.

It’s true that Poland’s ruling party has sought to curb immigration from Muslim countries, but not from elsewhere in Eastern Europe, especially Ukraine. In 2016, Poland issued 586,000 first residence permits to nationals from non-EU countries. As Mazurczak observes, “Poland issued more such permits that year than did any other EU member-state except Britain — and more than Germany (505,000), which has more than double Poland’s population.” Poland has also been receptive to immigrants from the Philippines, another predominantly Catholic nation.

PiS Emulates Soft Socialism

On economics, PiS is not exactly a supporter of unfettered capitalism. “The party’s economic policies are closer to the democratic socialism of Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren than to the laissez-faire approach of the GOP,” notes Mazurczak. PiS has also pledged to increase the minimum wage and has increased social spending since it came to power.

The “500 Plus” program, in which families receive about $125 per child each month, has been quite popular among Poles. The program has reduced child poverty and increased Poland’s fertility rate from 1.32 in 2015 to 1.48 in 2017. Granted, as statistician Lyman Stone has noted, this is fairly small potatoes (or placki ziemniaczane, as it were), but when nearby nations experience demographic collapse, Poland’s efforts are a rare and remarkable feat.

It’s the prominent opposition party, led by Trzaskowski, that is pro-business. It’s true that the Warsaw mayor is both more socially liberal and more pro-EU than Duda, but his Civic Platform party is best characterized as centrist, if not center-right. “There is no left in Poland. The ex-communists had about a 10-year run, and they ran the damn thing into the ground,” one Polish-American intellectual said recently.

Media Is Missing the Real Story

Nevertheless, if prominent Western “experts” on Polish politics are to be believed, this is a battle between the forces of authoritarianism and democracy, regress versus progress. Journalist Anne Applebaum, whose husband Radosław Sikorski held prominent positions in previous Civic Platform administrations, has authored innumerable op-eds accusing PiS of destroying democratic norms and promoting autocracy. Yet Civic Platform under Sikorski and his allies suffered several high-profile corruption scandals, which resulted in top leaders resigning.

All this is to say that a center-right party that favors deregulated markets and strong integration with the EU (Civic Platform) lost to a pro-life, pro-family, pro-social-safety-net party with some socialist leanings (PiS). That’s not exactly as earth-shattering as the scaremongering media would have us believe.

As a friend of mine who studies Polish politics told me, “Western elites cannot hear PiS’s arguments because they cannot comprehend anything other than ‘rights.’” In its current manifestation, “rights” talk reduces to paeans for the country’s anti-Catholic LGBT movement. Unfortunately, English-language media seems largely incapable of telling this story.

Tasteless LGBT Activists Jeer At People Who Died From Coronavirus,"Where is the line between encouraging public health and public shaming? For LGBTQ Nation and many on the left, it seems to depend on your cultural and political views. The publication’s headline, “A transphobic veteran returned from war & refused to wear a mask. He died on the Fourth of July,” illustrates the mindset entirely.

The veteran in question, 37-year-old Richard Rose, was diagnosed with COVID-19 July 1 and passed away three days later from complications. He had no other pre-existing health conditions. Rose served in the U.S. Army for nine years, did two tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, and helped homeless vets and worked to prevent veteran suicides.

None of this, however, was important to LGBT activist ToddThaGod, who researched Rose’s Facebook and created a slideshow of assorted posts he felt exposed the veteran as a bad person. The slideshow featured posts of Rose expressing skepticism of masks, criticism of the Black Lives Matter movement, and, most damning of all, a meme in which a child tells a teacher there are “two” genders.

This particular sin was of particular importance to LGBTQ Nation. Being deemed “transphobic” is enough, it seems, to wipe away whatever good a person does in life. The slideshow currently has 3.6 million views.

A friend of Rose stated, “We should still be compassionate whether we agree with someone’s beliefs or not. Someone has passed away, and we should have some compassion towards that.”

“Conley did not explain why people should be compassionate about someone’s deliberate decision to endanger others,” LGBTQ Nation responded. ToodThaGod replied to his slideshow tweet, “Remember y’all: Mask it or casket.”

Another LGBT activist, John Aravosis, engaged in similar public humiliation in a tweet, saying, “78 y.o. Alabama man staunchly refused to wear a mask or social distance. He’s dead now.” Air Force veteran Joe Hinton was diagnosed with the Wuhan coronavirus and died five days later from complications. During the crisis, his family said he refused to live in fear. But as Aravosis announced to his 107,000 followers, Hinton did not wear a mask during his daily routine.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing masks, saying, “Cloth face coverings are recommended as a simple barrier to help prevent respiratory droplets from traveling into the air and onto other people when the person wearing the cloth face covering coughs, sneezes, talks, or raises their voice.” The CDC also states, “A cloth face covering may not protect the wearer, but it may keep the wearer from spreading the virus to others.”

Explaining why medical and public health experts did not recommend wearing masks early in the pandemic, the CDC says, “At that time, experts didn’t yet know the extent to which people with COVID-19 could spread the virus before symptoms appeared. Nor was it known that some people have COVID-19 but don’t have any symptoms. Both groups can unknowingly spread the virus to others.”

The assumption that Rose and Hinton were infected because they didn’t wear masks is just that, an assumption. It is also unfair to assume they infected anyone else. What is puzzling is how a person can become infected and even die while all those around him can remain uninfected.

But left-wing activists seem to be particularly thrilled at the prospect of people they already do not like becoming sick and dying of this illness, calling it a “punishment.” LGBTQ Nation presented this particular view in an article titled, “If HIV was God’s punishment for gays, then coronavirus is punishment for conservative Christians.”

Of course, these writers are the ones engaging in the behavior to which they are alluding. While many in the early days of AIDS blamed gay men for becoming infected with HIV based on their behavior and refusal to engage in safety measures, today this immoral position is the one these LGBT activists hold over those who have died from COVID-19.

The pandemic has been wildly political, the causes and prevention methods have widely shifted, and the rules of public gatherings have depended on the political position of the expert being interviewed. It is not unreasonable for average people to question these things.

The families and friends of both men have asked for others to take precautions, and it is important that we all do not become complacent and ignore precautions due to the politicized nature of the pandemic. But we also cannot indulge cruel and sociopathic public shaming of politically convenient victims.

No one deserves to be infected with coronavirus, and no one deserves to die from it. No family deserves to be exploited as a cautionary tale for society, and a person’s value should not be reduced to a few cherry-picked social media posts.

You Won't Believe What Kind Of Sex Ed LGBT Activists Want In Texas,"For the first time since 1997, Texas education officials are reviewing — and potentially revising — health standards for all Texas public schools. While this should be an opportunity for strengthening the current factual, biological standards, leftist LGBT advocacy groups are calling this review process a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” to attack Texas’s abstinence-focused approach and teach medically inaccurate, highly sexualized LGBT programming as early as kindergarten.

In Texas, the State Board of Education recently took public testimony on recommendations for new sex-ed standards compiled by health and education experts. Thankfully, the current standards before the SBOE are abstinence-focused, so opponents face an uphill climb. But that didn’t stop radical organizations such as Texas Freedom Network and SIECUS, who recruited witnesses to bombard the SBOE members with more than 12 hours of radical, pro-LGBT propaganda.

Witnesses urged SBOE members to include “sexual orientation and gender identity” or abortion rights in the Health portion of Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills state standards with vague exhortations to “be on the right side of history.” Their testimony contained many outrageous claims that are worth exploring to show the general outrageousness of the subject matter being pushed.

One teen pregnancy prevention coordinator claimed, “Youth who are taught abstinence-based or abstinence-only education are more likely to contract an STD, become a young parent, partake in other risky behaviors and even face incarceration.” A woman who wants LGBT sex to be taught in school proclaimed, “I was 15 when I wanted to have sex with my girlfriend but, we did not know how to because we were never taught.”

A representative from the Texas Is Ready Campaign told the board to ignore the more than 4,000 emails from their constituents opposing “comprehensive” (i.e., far-left) sex education and instead consider a recent survey that polled only 600 Texans. On the topic of supporting teaching “gender identity” in sex education, a woman testified that students should not be worried about defining people as male or female.

At another point, a Community Organizer for NARAL Pro-Choice admitted she favors teaching young people about abortion and wants kids to know that abortion is a “safe,” “common,” and “normal medical procedure.” Several abortion activist groups such as Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice Texas, and Jane’s Due Process testified for abortion to be taught in schools. Although it is illegal for minors to receive an abortion without parental consent in Texas, abortion activists argued that Texas public schools need to teach minor students that abortion is “safe” and “legal.”

The last time we saw such egregiously radical examples of LGBT style sex-ed was in local Austin public schools. Parents overwhelmingly came out against comprehensive sex-ed LGBT indoctrination last year when Austin considered changing their local curriculum. What the Austin proposals advocated are fairly shocking.

The Austin plans sought to promote a full-on LGBT agenda, including students being told to attend pride rallies, be advocates for the LGBT political agenda, and “denounce inequality.” Presumably, this would include teaching students to denounce other children who hold to the biblical view of marriage and sexuality. The plans sought to falsely teach children their gender is not determined by biological sex, and inaccurately allege that doctors “decide” a baby’s sex.

Students in 6th grade (12-year-olds) would have been read a scenario where an 8th grader (14-year-old) enters a romantic and physical relationship with a 17-year-old boy who lives alone and the 8th grader keeps it secret from her parents and friends.

Among a list of several different “sexualities” labeled as “common,” heterosexuality is not mentioned, although homophobia was cited in the list of definitions. Indeed, children would have been told to directly “challenge homophobia,” which is merely described as discrimination. Other images depicting sexual acts are too graphic to share.

This type of radical sex education encourages exploring sex at any age, with any gender, that gender is “fluid” and has nothing to do with biological sex, and that birth control and abortion are basic rights which should be unapologetically promoted. Failure rates of contraceptives are ignored, and STDs are promoted as trivial medical conditions that can be treated.

As a result, children face tremendous pressure to engage in sexual activity. As explained by Monica Cline, a former Planned Parenthood sex education coordinator, a group of students she was teaching told her no one ever explained to them that they didn’t have to have sex.

At the SBOE, comprehensive sex-ed supporters touted a 600-person poll taken by a local research firm indicating support for their version of radical sex-ed. Yet, in the March 3 Texas Republican primary election, more than 1.7 million people voted in support of parents being the sole decision-makers over their child’s sex education.

Texas Values also presented written and oral testimony with more than 20 specific recommendations for keeping the abstinence-focused education currently in place, and we will track the standards throughout the rest of the process.

LGBTQ Blog Publishes Female Athletes' Names After Asking NCAA To Protect Women's Sports,"Outsports, an LGBTQ sports and activism blog owned by Vox Media, published the names of over 300 women athletes who stood their ground by signing a letter addressed to the National College Athletic Association Board of Governors asking for the preservation of women’s sports “without permission.”

#MartinaNavratilova is the first name on a list of 300+ women athletes who signed a letter from an anti-trans group to the @NCAA https://t.co/PYsCJESnTT — Outsports (@outsports) August 3, 2020

In the letter, hundreds of women athletes urge the NCAA board not to participate in a boycott organized by the American Civil Liberties Union and transgender athlete Lindsay Hecox against Idaho for passing the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act, which necessitates participation by student athletes according to their sex.

“Fairness for female athletes should not be a political or partisan issue,” the letter read. “We athletes have diverse views on many topics, but stand united on this fact: protecting the integrity of women’s sports is pro-woman, pro-fairness, and consistent with the purpose and promise of Title IX.”

While many of the signatories were “afraid of the backlash that they might get on social media of being labeled a transphobe or a hater” if their names were released, Outpost published screenshots of all of the names claiming that it was “in the public interest, because those who stand in favor of discrimination ought to be held accountable.”

Save Women’s Sports, the organization that helped collect signatures for the letter, released a statement condemning Outpost as an “extremist activist group” and “disreputable organization.”

These petty attempts to silence female athletes are the very reason we needed to write this letter to the NCAA: bullying and harassment must not be tolerated. It is disgraceful that Outsports and other like-minded extremist activist groups, are bullying and harassing women simply for standing up for fairness in the sports they love. Rather than engaging in peaceful dialogue, Outsports is on a witch-hunt to silence women for respectfully advocating for fair competition. We at Save Women’s Sports, along with hundreds of female athletes, choose dialogue over doxing and we reject these bullying tactics from fringe, petty, and disreputable organizations. We will not be silenced.

Christiana Holcomb, an Alliance Defending Freedom attorney who is representing Idaho State University athletes Madison Kenyon and Mary Kate Marshall as well as some of the other women who signed the letter, called Outsports’s article “a witch-hunt.”

Just last week, Holcomb told The Federalist that some “activist organizations” would try “telling female athletes that they need to be silent.”

“Anytime you allow a biological male into their category and allow them to take away spots and push female athletes down in the rankings, that is discrimination against female athletes because Title IX was designed to give them those opportunities,” Holcomb said. “There’s a lot of loud activist organizations out there that are striving to tell the American public that this is the way that sports should look and telling female athletes that they need to be silent.”

Linda Blade, one of the signatories of the letter and a former NCAA All-American heptathlon athlete, also expressed her disapproval with Outsports calling them “bullies” for pushing a “hateful agenda.”

Hey @outsports:

I am honoured to be on this list🏆

By trying to shame us you and your little @ncaa #ncaa minions who released the letter are showing us PRECISELY WHY we needed to write the letter.

Because you are bullies.#IStandWithMartina @martina and all the women listed. ✅ https://t.co/voFYx1f2QX — Linda Blade (@coachblade) August 3, 2020

“If @outsports has its way, #sport opportunities for #female #athletes will be greatly diminished,” she tweeted.

If @outsports has its way, #sport opportunities for #female #athletes will be greatly diminished.

Let’s hope that @ncaa #ncaa leadership sees this letter and the possible damage to women of bowing to #outsports hateful agenda.#SexNotGender for preservation of women’s #sports. — Linda Blade (@coachblade) August 3, 2020

No California Shouldn’t Decriminalize Adult Sex With 14-Year-Olds,"LGBT activists have pushed reasonable notions of equality to its limits with obscene perversions. State Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco — the same lawmaker who co-sponsored a bill in 2017 to remove the felony penalty for knowingly exposing another person to HIV — has introduced a bill, Senate Bill 145 to give judges more flexibility in sentencing gay men who abuse minors.

Under current law — which Wiener, who is gay, describes as “horrific homophobia” — a straight 24-year-old male who has sex with a 15-year-old girl can avoid being put on the sex-offender list if the judge feels the situation does not deserve it, but a gay man in the same scenario with a similar-aged boy would not be given the same option.

Wiener’s argument is one of evolving social standards. In 2015, the California Supreme Court upheld the long-standing separation of vaginal sex from other forms of sex-based on the misguided idea that if pregnancy occurred, placing the father on the sex-offender list could ruin his chances of providing for his family. The extreme of the scenario would be an 18-year-old man with a 17-year-old girlfriend.

Wiener’s bill, however, is not so straightforward. He argues all forms of sex should be treated equally under the law.

The Law Will Protect Exploitation of Minors

Moreover, while there is room for flexibility in a ruling in which a boy turns 18 while his girlfriend is still 17 and her father presses charges, the bill defines the age minimum at 14. Recognizing that minors cannot legally consent to sex, Wiener argues that if a minor age 14 to 17 voluntarily has sex with an adult who is less than 10 years older, the judge should decide based on the individual facts of the case whether the adult should be placed on the sex-offender registry. Data provided by Wiener’s office states, “[A]t least 2,400 people on the [CA] sex-offender registry, and potentially hundreds more, have been convicted of non-vaginal sex with a minor age 14 or older.”

The argument on its own sounds like a simple proposal for equal treatment under the law. As Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Bradley McCartt told state lawmakers, “Remember, it’s not the punishment for the crime. It’s a public safety issue that has to do with crime-solving and keeping track of predators.”

But it is the mindset behind the age issue that is most concerning. “We need to stop criminalizing teenage sex,” Wiener said. “At a minimum, we should not be forcing these kids onto the sex-offender registry and ruining their lives.”

The problem is that it isn’t about teenagers having sex. It’s about adults exploiting minors sexually and being legally protected in doing so. What possible justification would there be for a 24-year-old to have sex with a 15-year-old of either sex? The rational answer, of course, is there is none. Rather than addressing this reasonable concern, however, left-wing and LGBT sites decided opposition was homophobic and hateful.

Left-Wing Media Smears Conservative Detractors

Mother Jones, for example, titled an article, “A California State Senator Introduced a Bill Pushing LGBTQ Equality — and a QAnon Mob Came for Him.” The article begins by arguing, “Scott Wiener is used to being targeted for his legislation. The California State Senator represents San Francisco, and has long championed the kind of progressive reforms that have attracted the ire of right-wing culture warriors and their online trolling.”

But what is progressive about decriminalizing the intentional exposure of HIV to innocent victims and now pushing legislation to reduce the crime of sexually abusing 14-year-olds?

LGBTQ Nation also jumped on the victim story with an article titled, “Rightwing launches disgusting attack on ‘pedophile’ gay lawmaker over equality legislation.” Making it sound as though the only opposition boils down to anti-LGBT hate from right-wing extremists, the article says, “A gay lawmaker in California has been targeted by rightwing media as part of what they believe is a pedophile conspiracy because he introduced a bill to treat LGBTQ sex offenders the same as straight sex offenders.”

As has become far too common, opposing perceived right-wing attacks is more important than critically addressing dangerous legislation.

When It Comes to Sex, We Can’t Treat Minors Like Adults

This all comes down to the LGBT fixation on treating minors as adults capable of adult decision-making. Yet there is simply no reason for someone between the ages of 14 and 16 to be in a relationship with an adult. This should be non-negotiable, regardless of the sexes involved.

The only gray area involves teenagers on the edge of lawful adulthood who might cross over just enough to fall into legal issues. For example, McCartt provided a story of a 17-year-old girl whose mother did not want her dating a girl and pressed charges against the daughter’s 18-year-old girlfriend.

Providing reasonable legal accommodation to this very specific and narrow experience should not be an open invitation for adults to exploit young teenagers by engaging in sex with them. Unfortunately, Wiener and other California lawmakers, who have had no formal pushback on this legislation so far, are more interested in pursuing grand social ideals rather than writing simple, rational law. Left-wing media is all too happy to use labels of “hate” and “conspiracy theories” to dismiss legitimate concerns.

Airline Eliminates Sex-Specific Greetings To Passengers. Why It Matters,"Starting this October, Japan Airlines will no longer address passengers as “ladies and gentlemen.” A company press release announced “gender-based honorific titles … will be abolished,” replaced with gender-neutral greetings like “everyone” and “passengers” for English-speaking travelers on all flights and throughout their terminals.

JAL spokesman Mark Morimoto told The New York Times, “We aspire to be a company where we can create a positive atmosphere and treat everyone, including our customers, with respect.” It certainly marks a strange turn when referring to others as “ladies and gentlemen” is disallowed because it’s disrespectful. After Air Canada and EasyJet, JAL is the third airline to adopt such a policy.

Even though this is a seemingly insignificant, token bow to ubiquitous LGBT sensitivities, it is a policy change that is worthy of contempt. Why? Because of basic logic and the essence of what it means to be human.

Every person boarding a Japan Airlines plane is either male or female, a boy or a girl, a lady, or a gentleman. Every. One. There is no third option. “Non-binary” is not a thing, and no amount of wishful thinking can change that.

The LGBT construct itself proves the point as it requires the binary. The “L” and the “G” are ladies and gentlemen who are attracted to ladies and gentlemen of the same sex. What other players from the supposed rainbow spectrum of genders are included among the “L”s and the “G”s? None. And the B? It’s not called “Bi” for nothing. And then the T? Transgenderism is a binary, two-way street running from male-to-female and female-to-male. There are no other options.

The new JAL policy denies the human essence of every customer that boards their planes. Each JAL passenger has a birth certificate clearly marked male or female and no other. (Yes, a minuscule few have certificates noting them as non-binary, but they have done so only recently after exerting significant political pressure to change what medical professionals had previously determined. They are a dramatically rare exception that proves the rule.)

As each passenger passes through airport security, if he or she requires additional screening, it is carefully conducted by highly trained professionals who are very much attuned to whether they are processing a lady or a gentleman.

The files at their doctor’s office are carefully and correctly noted either male or female. If any of their travelers undergo surgery, the medical professionals are extremely careful to note whether the patient is a lady or a gentleman. Why? Because these two types of bodies are very distinct from each other in remarkably important ways and these differences will demand a distinct medical approach. And this is not just reproductive. Men and women have different and distinct cardiovascular systems, neurological systems, and respiratory systems.

If, heaven forbid, a JAL passenger were to die, his or her death certificate will be marked either male or female. The insurance documents processing the death dividends to next of kin will be listed as either male or female. Humans are one of the two sexes. Period.

There is no such thing as a non-binary person. If you ever have the pleasure of meeting anyone who claims to be such a person, you will be meeting someone who is simply a male or female who doesn’t see their maleness or femaleness in the typical fashion.

Sometimes they will identify as the other sex, like these two. Or they will merely identify in a more androgynous manner, presenting with some form of gender-neutral clothing, hair, and personal grooming like this individual. They are not, however, some new kind of gender or sex. Their non-binarity exists in their head, in their own self-conception. For the human species, non-binariness does not objectively exist in nature.

This points to one of the great ironies of contemporary gender theory. Its dominant tenet is that “males” and “females” do not exist but are merely social constructs. You learn that in the first 15 minutes of your first gender studies class. That is unless you are trans. Then, and only then, are you actually, truly the woman or a man nature made you to be.

Thus everyone else is required, through the threat of law and public shaming, to recognize and honor you as such. It is such a serious thing that referring to such people with the wrong pronoun can sometimes get you fired from your job.

So, in the wacky world of gender theory, you are a woman, not if you actually are, but only if you believe you are. This is the make-believe game that Japan Airlines and so many other companies are playing along with.

But, you might ask, “Aren’t intersex people non-binary?” No. Being intersex is a whole other thing. A non-binary identity exists in the mind. Being intersex is an objective, physiological condition where one’s body does not develop regularly in terms of clearly indicating one’s male or femaleness — either externally, internally, or both. The person’s male or femaleness is there. It’s just that body is sending some unclear signals as to what its sex is.

The Intersex Society of North America, an advocacy group for intersex individuals and their families, does not believe that intersex is another gender beyond the binarity of male or female. And they expressly do not support degendering society. Intersex people are exceedingly rare in human experience. Furthermore, The Journal of Sex Research reports that it encompasses only 0.018 percent of the human population.

Now, if a person wants to believe he or she is not the male or female that his or her body is, that person has that right. We all have the right to believe nearly anything about ourselves. While objective medical science will refute them readily, someone can even believe they are neither male nor female.

When, however, society at large — be it a local, state or federal government, a school, place of employment, or a multi-national corporation — dictates that we must all play along and that the words we use must align with that person’s alternative reality, we have moved into very problematic territory. It is reasonable — even virtuous — to resist such efforts.

Policies that impose belief in a false reality violate the beauty and essence of humanity and society. Male and female are biological terms. Ladies are gentlemen are elegantly human, societal terms. They are aspirations, ideals for what we would like males and females to become, and for how they should conduct themselves.

Would you rather the seatmate on your 13-hour flight from Tokyo to NYC to be a man, or a gentleman? A woman, or a lady? You know the difference, and each subsequent hour of your trans-Pacific flight will reveal it soon enough if you aren’t sure. One is someone you might have to endure. The other will be someone who will make your journey all the more pleasant.

There is everything worth celebrating about being a lady or a gentleman. Talking about such distinctions in public places — like airports — is a good thing and hurts no one. Words matter, and we abolish them to our great peril.

"Amy Coney Barrett Is Not A Threat To Obergefell, The Constitution Is","Is the nomination and potential confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett an existential threat to gay rights in America? The fear campaign set off by LGBT media after comments from Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito regarding the consequences of the Obergefell decision has convinced many this is the case.

On Oct. 5, 2020, the Supreme Court decided not to hear the case brought by Kim Davis, a former Kentucky county clerk, who refused to issue a marriage license to a same-sex couple in 2015. In comments on the case, Justice Thomas argued, “Due to Obergefell, those with sincerely held religious beliefs concerning marriage will find it increasingly difficult to participate in society without running afoul of Obergefell and its effect on other anti-discrimination laws.”

He continued, “It would be one thing if recognition for same-sex marriage had been debated and adopted through the democratic process, with the people deciding not to provide statutory protections for religious liberty under state law. But it is quite another when the court forces that choice upon society through its creation of atextual constitutional rights and its ungenerous interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause, leaving those with religious objections in the lurch.”

In response, multiple LGBT sites declared, as Queerty expressed it in a headline, “Two Supreme Court Justices just said they want to overturn marriage equality.” Former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg tweeted, “So much for precedent and judicial restraint. Two justices now openly call for an end to marriage equality—knowing reinforcements are on the way. The stakes could not be higher.”

The Human Rights Campaign echoed the sentiment, tweeting, “The alarming statements from Justices Thomas and Alito regarding marriage equality are a clear sign that LGBTQ rights still hang in the balance with the Supreme Court. Our love is valid, our love is equal and our rights must be. #LoveWins”

Queerty highlighted this quote from the court document signed by both Justice Alito and Justice Thomas: “By choosing to privilege a novel constitutional right over the religious liberty interests explicitly protected in the First Amendment, and by doing so undemocratically, the Court has created a problem that only it can fix. Until then, Obergefell will continue to have “ruinous consequences for religious liberty.” They followed up with, “Did you catch that last part about how same-sex marriage is a problem that only the Supreme Court can fix?”

The hysteria, however, appears to have missed the point. The justices, who dissented in Obergefell v. Hodges on these same grounds, were commenting on the legal consequences such a broad ruling has on issues larger than same-sex marriage. Neither justice commented on the nature of same-sex marriage or its validity, and neither implied it was the cause of religious liberty concerns. Neither came close to even hinting at overturning “marriage equality.”

What they did speak to was the consequences of how LGBT activists have abused the ruling to attack Christians ever since, under the flag of constitutional rights. As the Masterpiece Cakeshop case illustrated, the LGBT left has dedicated its energy and activism towards targeting Christian business owners for harassment and financial ruin in the name of “equality.” Had they not so aggressively threatened religious liberty, this would not have been an issue.

That really is the argument the justices are making here. When they say the court created a problem only it can fix, they are not talking about same-sex marriage. They are referencing the fact that Obergefell ignored its probable effects on religious Americans and their rights, which are being infringed upon, and that is something the court must address under its duty to protect constitutional rights.

This in no way requires overturning Obergefell to accomplish. The hysteria is over nothing.

Obergefell did not make same-sex marriage a constitutional right, it simply stated that states could not restrict marriage based on sex. Bostock v. Clayton County Georgia also argued that sex, as understood in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, includes sexual orientation.

What, however, if Obergefell were to be overturned? Currently, 67 percent of Americans support same-sex marriage, with nearly half of Republicans agreeing. States would once again be free to define marriage based on the will of the voters. Due to legally married same-sex couples living in every state in the nation, as well as fully recognized throughout the federal government, refusing to recognize same-sex marriage or outright banning it would be exceedingly difficult.

This is a situation the LGBT left has placed itself in. Had they continued to fight for same-sex marriage recognition at the state level, they would have had a much stronger foundation to stand on. By forcing the issue through an activist Supreme Court that fabricated a “right” through creative interpretation of the law, they have made themselves vulnerable to new justices recognizing this flaw as unconstitutional.

By giving one branch of government this much power over their lives when it suited them, they risk that power acting against their wishes when it no longer does. Despite the hysteria, there is nothing to substantiate the claim that Obergefell is on the agenda to be overturned, even with Barrett’s potential confirmation. This should be evidenced by the court’s rejection of Davis’s case.

Webster’s Redefined ‘Sexual Preference’ After Amy Coney Barrett Used It To Match Leftist Talking Points,"The online version of the Merriam-Webster Dictionary changed the definition of “sexual preference” on the same day that senators scolded Judge Amy Coney Barrett for her use of the word during day two of her confirmation hearings.

When questioned by Democratic senators on the judiciary committee on Obergefell v. Hodges, which decreed a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, Sens. Mazie Hirono and Cory Booker reprimanded Barrett for using the term “sexual preference,” claiming that is was outdated and offensive.

“You use the term sexual preference to describe those in the LGBTQ community,” Hirono said. “Let me make clear: ‘sexual preference’ is an offensive, an outdated term. It is used by anti-LGBTQ activists to suggest that sexual orientation is a choice. It is not.”

While Barrett apologized for the alleged error, saying that she meant no harm to anyone by using the widely adopted terminology, the leftist senators complained that Barrett’s use of the word indicates her personal beliefs about the case ruling.

“I certainly didn’t mean and would never mean to use a term that would cause any offense in the LGBTQ community. If I did, I greatly apologize,” Barrett clarified.

It was shortly after this public scolding that internet archives show Webster’s made a change to the page for the definition of “preference,” adding that when used as “sexual preference” the word is “offensive.”

As recently as last month, Webster’s Dictionary included a definition of “preference” as “orientation” or “sexual preference.” TODAY they changed it and added the word “offensive.""

Despite Democrats’ claims that Barrett gravely misspoke and that her words warranted an apology, many Democratic politicians including Presidential Nominee Joe Biden and Senate Judiciary Committee members Dick Durbin and Richard Blumenthal recently used the word in public settings and received no pushback.

Many news outlets also recently published stories using the term “sexual preference” and did not qualify or label it as offensive.

While this Orwellian addition shocked some on Twitter, it follows a pattern of the institutions guarding the language guidelines in society backtracking on their definitions to match what the mob is demanding.

In late September, the Associated Press Stylebook which guides most newsrooms’ grammar, punctuation, and terminology, exercised its authority in the journalism world to qualify the term “riot” and discouraged media outlets from using it, despite the apparent violence in many cities across the nation.

“Use care in deciding which term best applies: A riot is a wild or violent disturbance of the peace involving a group of people. The term riot suggests uncontrolled chaos and pandemonium,” said the AP Stylebook.

“Focusing on rioting and property destruction rather than underlying grievance has been used in the past to stigmatize broad swaths of people protesting against lynching, police brutality or for racial justice, going back to the urban uprisings of the 1960s,” the announcement continued.

Biden Bases His Transgender Policies On Fake News,"During Joe Biden’s latest town hall, the former vice president and current Democratic nominee repeated something that has become pervasive in LGBT and media reporting: “Too many transgender women of color are being murdered.” He went on to cite 33 murders of transgender women, noting that, this year, most have been persons of color.

In a recent LGBTQ Nation op-ed, Biden pledges, “As President, I will put forward comprehensive solutions to help empower the transgender and gender non-conforming community and prioritize the prosecution of anti-transgender violence.” Biden writes that he was inspired by the mid-October murder of Sara Blackwood, a transgender male from Indianapolis, Ind., who was shot while walking home from a shift at a fast-food restaurant.

Biden’s website provides a longer statement regarding this widespread belief, arguing, “These deaths don’t exist within a vacuum.” He goes on to list everything from “dehumanizing” government actions to the alleged ban of transgender people from the military to a “failure to address risk factors like domestic and intimate partner violence.” Among the list of alleged contributing factors is “underemployment and unemployment and poverty, housing insecurity, and health disparities put this community at risk.”

Here Biden tacitly admits a major weakness in the left’s repeated claims of an “epidemic” against transgender people: The issue has nothing to do with hate crimes. As with the majority of reported lethal violence since 2015 where the victim has been transgender or gender non-conforming, there is no evidence Blackwood was targeted for gender identity. Contrary to the narrative, nearly all crimes against transgender individuals are not related to their transgenderism.

Further, when Biden says he will “prioritize” prosecution of anti-transgender violence, what more is he arguing could be done? Biden argues, “President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have fueled the flames of transphobia in our nation while refusing to acknowledge the epidemic of violence” and demands that “solving the epidemic” will require a president who not only recognizes the epidemic as fact but who “believes” in the “humanity and dignity” of transgender people.

What is Biden’s solution? He vows:

My administration will enact the Equality Act to end legal discrimination against LGBTQ+ people, expand economic opportunities for LGBTQ+ people, reform our treatment of transgender and gender non-conforming individuals in our criminal justice system, ensure access to accurate identification documents, and improve government data collection to better track violence against the transgender community.

Consider what he is arguing here. The Supreme Court case Bostock v. Clayton County already solidified the legal status of LGBT people in the workplace. The Equality Act does little to nothing more than Bostock already achieved by arguing sexual orientation and gender identity fall under the umbrella of the word “sex” in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that bans employment discrimination.

What the Equality Act does demand, however, is further degradation of religious freedom. For example, under the Equality Act, religious adoption and foster care services would be required to adhere to “affirming” LGBT placement and standards.

The legislation would also ban limiting sex-segregated spaces to biological sex and discrimination related to “public accommodation,” including in “Any establishment that provides a good, service, or program, including a store, shopping center, online retailer or service provider, salon, bank, gas station, food bank, service or care center, shelter, travel agency, or funeral parlor, or establishment that provides health care, accounting, or legal services.”

Of course, the left has aggressively demanded prisons accommodate individuals based exclusively on their gender identity, regardless of the risks to either the individual or those they are housed with. Fighting housing insecurity? Improving government tracking of violence against transgender people? Addressing health disparities and domestic violence? “Expanding” economic opportunities for LGBT people? Biden seems to be demanding action on “issues” without any compelling evidence such matters are problems in the first place — all through imposing a nationwide transgender policy via federal authority.

To understand the “violence epidemic” against transgender Americans, a recent incident is enlightening. LGBTQ Nation reported the following headline, “Police cracked jokes about a transgender hate crime victim as she bled on the floor.” The incident occurred in Philadelphia in August of this year.

The Human Rights Campaign tells of a black transgender male who was home alone with a spouse and two goddaughters when a mob broke into their house and beat the transgender person. A local TV report claimed it was, “because she was transgender.” The mob allegedly used racial and transphobic slurs.

The victim, Kendall Stephens, insisted as a consequence that transgender people fear for their lives every day and now are not even safe within their homes. Stephens even reported, as the headline implies, that at the police station officers mocked Stephens.

The reality is far from this narrative. Security footage and the victim’s report show a group of unruly people drinking and fighting outside of Stephens’s home on a city street. Stephens went outside to ask them to quiet down and called 911, to which one woman shouts at Stephens and pursues Stephens inside, beating Stephens.

Rather than ignore Stephens, the police insisted Stephens file a criminal complaint, which Stephens failed to do immediately. The case is being investigated. While Stephens was certainly the victim of a crime, there is no current evidence it was a hate crime.

The issue at hand is the dishonesty with which Biden, LGBT advocacy groups, and corporate media portray such incidents to serve as the basis for their government policies and far-reaching legal standards. As in the above example, what is told by the media simply doesn’t reflect the truth of what transgender Americans face as challenges, nor is it evidence that government intervention is even required in the first place. What policy could Biden put in place to prevent a person walking home late at night in a city from being randomly shot, or a person being targeted by an angry drunken mob on a city street outside his house because he called 911 on them?

It is the exploitation of fear by the Democratic Party, LGBT advocacy, and the media that is fueling this false sense of urgency. If all lethal violence towards transgender people is considered, including accidental deaths, police shootings, domestic violence, and even victims of mass shootings, 0.001 percent of the transgender population, less than 1 percent of the U.S. population, is affected.

We don’t need a president that easily falls for the misleading information presented by LGBT media or who agrees to perpetuate false narratives to pander to a voting bloc.

"After Trans Activists Try To Ban Book, It Becomes A Bestseller","It seems the battle about the rights and privileges of transgender Americans has come down to what other people are allowed to say about them. The controversy over Abigail Shrier’s book, “Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters,” demonstrates how far this battle has come.

Shrier’s book, which explores the phenomenon of many teenage girls suddenly and impulsively insisting they are now boys and how this affects their families and futures, has come under fire from transgender activists. Chase Strangio of the American Civil Liberties Union tweeted, “Abigail Shrier’s book is a dangerous polemic with a goal of making people not trans. I think of all the times & ways I was told my transness wasn’t real & the daily toll that still takes. We have to fight these ideas which are leading to the criminalization of trans life again.”

Several anonymous transgender Twitter users also expressed this belief and reached out to Target, demanding the retailer remove the book from its shelves. Target promptly did. After a heavy backlash that sent Shrier’s book into the best-seller category on Amazon, including No. 15 in all books, Target reversed its decision, also quietly doing the same for its removal of Debra Soh’s “The End of Gender: Debunking the Myths about Sex and Identity in Our Society.”

“I dream of and fight for a world where Abigail’s book isn’t the #1 seller on Amazon under ‘LGBT,’” Strangio lamented in response, “Where there is no market for ideas fueled by fear of our existence and the possibilities we make possible in the world.”

Tucker Carlson highlighted one of Strangio’s recent tweets, which said, “Also stopping the circulation of this book and these ideas is 100% a hill I will die on.” Strangio later complained it was meant to be a joke and deleted the tweet, but what else would an objective observer walk away with after a lawyer for the ACLU declared a book dangerous, fueled by “fear of our existence,” and articulated a belief in wanting such books to have no market at all?

Strangio tweeted, “What these people are doing to me is going to put me in danger. They think its [sic] all fun and games but have no idea what its like to actually be trans in the world they are creating.”

Strangio might fit the traditional understanding of gender dysphoria, a persistent and distressing discomfort in one’s biological sex from childhood forward, but what Shrier explores in her book are stories of young girls who suddenly and in groups of friends announce their new trans identity and begin pursuing permanent physical changes without parental knowledge or consent.

Shrier did not write a “dangerous polemic” criticizing or dismissing transgender identity. She wrote a book on the effects of a social contagion and how it has destroyed the lives of young women and their families, explaining how LGBT and transgender activists silence any discussion of this.

It seems the core of Strangio’s complaint is viewing personal experiences through the perspective of how others view him. Using fear and urgency, Strangio positions transgender people’s lives as though they hang in the balance of how other people think about transgender issues and the negative influence Shrier’s book could have on them.

Strangio was born female and transitioned, adopted a new name and a new legal gender, pursued a legal career, and achieved a successful position fighting for Strangio’s beliefs for the largest civil rights group in America. Yet as Shrier points out in the Carlson interview, we’re supposed to believe Shrier’s one single book, the only one in existence on this specific subject, personally threatens Strangio’s “transness”?

A movement that can marginalize and silence viewpoints it finds threatening is not a victimized group. More to the point, what Strangio is effectively arguing here is that the personal identities of all transgender people cease to exist when directly observed without a lens of gender-affirmative theory.

In “Irreversible Damage,” Shrier speaks with transgender people, their families, both conservatives and progressives, and medical professionals, and comes away with a clear understanding of what gender dysphoria is and what it is not. For a movement that struggles to define itself and its wants, this book is a positive development.

This debacle is profoundly disturbing and frustrating. The passion of a person’s insecurities should not dictate what other people read and share. Activists must stop constantly portraying themselves and thus the transgender movement as mentally fragile and emotionally unstable.

Whether Strangio and other LGBT activists like it, a huge market for critical thinking and honest discussions surrounds these issues. Meanwhile, they continue bullying businesses into removing content through fear tactics and threats of persecution rather than by countering the message with their own better one.

'Transhood' Shows Parents Brainwashing 4-Year-Old Into Transgenderism,"A new HBO documentary, titled “Transhood,” is pushing the limits of what America understands as the transgender rights movement. Following four so-called transgender children, aged 4, 7, 12, and 15, the documentary’s description says it demonstrates “how the kids are challenged and transformed as they experience the complexity of their identities.” While through the lens of leftist LGBT advocacy this might sound empowering, from a rational point of view, it is far from a positive development.

In a scene shared by Matt Walsh, the family of the 4-year-old attends what looks to be a progressive church. The religious leader opens the floor for anyone in the congregation to “claim their identity publicly” as LGBT, rattling off a long string of other identity options, and for the group to celebrate them together.

A mother brings up a little boy, dressed in girl’s clothing, who shyly holds the microphone as his mother prompts him, “Do you want to tell them if you’re a boy or a girl?” The boy looks up at his mother for reassurance as he says quietly, “I just want to tell them I am a girl.”

The boy, still too shy to speak for himself, hands his mother the microphone, and she confidently announces that the child would like everyone to know he is a girl and prefers female pronouns. The religious leader and a helper hand the child a flower as the congregation says together, “May you be well, safe, and whole. We honor you exactly as you are.”

In another scene, the little boy is sitting in a dress as his mother reads to him, surrounded by typical girls’ toys and decor. Walsh tweeted, “This is from HBO’s ‘Transhood’ documentary. A mother puts her 4 year old son in a dress and reads him LGBT propaganda. You’re literally watching her brainwash the child into thinking he’s a girl. It’s no mystery how children end up ‘trans.’ This is it. Right here.” Walsh is not far from the truth — and the majority of LGBT and medical authorities on the subject seem to agree with him, yet in a roundabout way.

Trans Activists Say Affirmation Is the Only Option

In a guidebook for schools, titled “Schools in Transition,” the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT organization, warns, “The consequences of not affirming a child’s gender identity can be severe.” One 2018 article published by the American Psychological Association, titled “Embracing a gender-affirmative model for transgender youth,” argues, “The new research has a simple message: When transgender children get support affirming their gender identities, their mental health difficulties go down; when they don’t get support, they go up.” The article says the “pathology” of gender dysphoria is our culture and that nothing is “wrong” with the child.

To illustrate this argument, the author tells the story of a 14-year-old autistic girl who suddenly fell into a depression, hated her body, began binding her breasts, and attempted to lose weight. “When Samantha told her pediatrician she wanted a mastectomy, the practice urged the family to consult a gender specialist,” the article says. Astonishingly, the article boasts that after one meeting with the gender specialist, “the psychologist concluded that Samantha was transgender and should proceed to transition.”

Despite her parents expressing concern that this was simply an issue involving her diagnosis of autism and the fact that autistic children often irrationally fixate on very specific things and refuse to move forward, the experts claimed this was normal. Transgenderism and autism frequently co-occur, the article states.

The parents concluded, “It was a process of saying goodbye to a daughter and welcoming a son.” Samantha began testosterone therapy and had an elective double mastectomy, which allegedly brought her joy, despite her continued fixation on her weight.

‘Transhood’ Parents Rob Children of Choice

In a 2016 document, titled “Supporting & Caring for Transgender Children,” the Human Rights Campaign, the American College of Osteopathic Pediatricians, and the American Academy of Pediatrics propose an even more concerning variable. Introducing the term “gender-expansive children” to account for the wide variation in gender expression, the document states, “Sometimes a child’s gender expression, or what they say about their gender, seem to be in flux.”

Their gender identity might be conditional to their environment, and they recognize it might “take time” for them to “figure it out.” The authors admit, “Although what a child says about their gender at a young age can hint at whether they’ll turn out to be transgender, there’s often no way to be sure.”

They introduce the separation of transgender children, who are distressed over their “assigned sex,” and gender-expansive children, who are not “gender-typical” and might be transgender or grow up to be nonbinary or perfectly normal. The American Psychological Association insists, “As puberty and the irreversible change it brings approach, transgender and gender-nonconforming youth may not be ready to make a decision about their ultimate gender.”

In other words, if a child is not quite one gender or the other, or is possibly both or neither, the medical experts and LGBT activists believe intervention is necessary, which parents must affirm and support. As a result, parents frantically attempt to interpret how a child feels about himself before the kid has any chance to live in his natural body.

To Walsh’s point, what other path would a 4-year-old take after announcing to his community, at the encouragement of his mother, that he is in fact a little girl? He lives as a girl, dresses in stereotypical clothing, and will likely take puberty blockers until he reaches his early teenage years, when adults will again affirm him and tell him castration, estrogen, and plastic surgery will finally make him “exactly who he is.”

What choices does this child have, based on whatever his mother thought proved he was “really” a girl when he was 4 years old? According to the experts, this all depends on his parents. For many who are highly critical of gender-affirmative therapy, this is the most important question of all, especially considering how wildly varied and fluid the experts are on even defining the condition. We simply cannot afford to ignore their influence and the influence of the parents involved.

Chuck Schumer Endorses Biden’s Plan To Force Public Schools To Allow Males In Female Bathrooms,"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer supports former Vice President Joe Biden’s plans to force schools receiving federal funding to accommodate students’ who want to use bathrooms, locker rooms, and play sports with students of the opposite biological sex.

“Joe Biden said that on his first day of office, he will give transgender students access to sports, bathrooms and locker rooms in accordance with their gender identity in federally funded schools,” a reporter stated. “Do you think he has the ability to do this and do you agree with his decision?”

“I agree with the decision and I know he’ll check things out thoroughly, legally,” Schumer responded.

In addition to granting transgender students’ privileges in the bathroom and on the field, Biden has promised to use “executive authority” to “immediately reverse” the Trump administration’s policies that he believes are discriminatory and implement an agenda to “advance global LGBTQ+ rights and development.”

Some of his proposed changes include enacting the House Democrats’ Equality Act to legally cement pro-LGBTQ actions including allowing incorporating “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” into federal anti-discrimination law, cracking down on the “broad exemptions to discriminate” through religious freedom, and expand and funnel federal funding to programs meant to support LGBTQ communities.

In October, Biden told a mother during his televised town hall that he supports young children choosing to “transition” and reaffirmed his promises to “flat-out just change the law” to accommodate his agenda.

“The idea that an 8-year-old child or a 10-year-old child decides, you know, ‘I decided I want to be transgender. That’s what I think I’d like to be. It would make my life a lot easier.’ There should be zero discrimination,” he said.

Biden’s comments at the town hall followed his pledge to sign the Equality Act to combat the “epidemic” of violence “against transgender and gender non-conforming people.”

“My administration will enact the Equality Act to end legal discrimination against LGBTQ+ people, expand economic opportunities for LGBTQ+ people, reform our treatment of transgender and gender non-conforming individuals in our criminal justice system, ensure access to accurate identification documents, and improve government data collection to better track violence against the transgender community,” Biden said.

Why Other Queers Are Stuffing Lesbians Back In The Closet,"“[L]esbian as a category” is vanishing, warns lesbian journalist Katie Herzog over at Andrew Sullivan’s Weekly Dish. She laments that being an out and proud lesbian is no longer cool and notes how women who like women are increasingly “coming out as nonbinary or as men” instead.

Herzog noted this just days before “Juno” and “The Umbrella Academy” star Ellen Page announced on December 1 that she is no longer a lesbian because she’s now a “he” named Elliot. She explained, “I can’t express how remarkable it feels to finally love who I am enough to pursue my authentic self.”

Ellen is still married to dancer Emma Portner. Thus, it is unclear what that makes Emma now. PinkNews reported that someone “clumsily” asked her this very question on Instagram, to which Emma curiously replied, “I hope you know my sexual preferences and gender identity are none of your business.”

But it does appear Emma is no longer a lesbian, explaining, “Release your labels of me. I am as fluid as can be.” It certainly was not the questioner who brought up labels. Emma throws them out like candy, describing her new husband (?) as “trans, queer and non-binary” and herself as “genderqueer.” Lesbian is no longer in their lexicon.

It’s more than celebrities. This is a nationwide trend. Lesbian bars are drying up at such a rapid clip that the Lesbian Bar Project is here to save them. While there are more than 63,000 bars across America today, only 15 of them are the lesbian type.

Alabama has precisely as many as California: one each. Texas is the only state with two. New York has three, all in Gotham. This is a dramatic decline from the roughly 200 lesbian joints that dotted our nation in the late 1980s.

LGBT Unfolds as an Attempt to Erase the Sexual Yin-Yang

Each of the lesbians Herzog spoke to for her article asked to be kept anonymous for fear of reprisals from their supposed allies in the queer community. One confirmed, “It’s not cool to be a lesbian in the same way that it’s cool to be queer or trans or nonbinary.” Another expressed that most of her peers now see the term “lesbians as stodgy, old-fashioned, and uncool, whereas queers were hip, edgy, and inclusive.”

Non-binary and queer are the cool new things. Anything that smacks of being a genuine woman is not. The stubborn fact that male and female each have an objective nature will ultimately be the end of contemporary gender theory, and it looks like lesbians are the canary in that coal mine.

Herzog tells of a professor friend who mentioned to a campus colleague that she was lesbian. The woman “reacted like I’d confessed to being a Confederate Lost-Causer.” She was scolded that “the term is outdated and problematic, and I shouldn’t use it.”

The problem is it’s a bit too bio-essentialist and exclusive. So this professor now keeps quiet about her sexuality among her leftist peers. In fact, she added ironically, “it’s like living in a second closet” now.

Lesbianism Is Not What Leftists Say It Is

What’s at work here is about much more than lesbianism simply losing its cool. It involves two fundamental problematic realities inherent in LGBT dogma and practice.

First, lesbianism never was the “thing” its promoters claimed it was. It is certainly not “just the way some people are.” This has been made clear in various ways in the academic literature over the last two decades.

Would it surprise you to know that people who identify as lesbian have much higher pregnancy rates than heterosexual women? It is true. One study among many explains, “Again, bisexual and lesbian teens were more likely in each region to report pregnancy histories than heterosexual peers.”

Another study examined the pregnancy rates of adult sexual-minority women [SMW], revealing the same thing: “In our supplementary analyses, we found that both unintended pregnancies ending in abortion and unintended pregnancies with other outcomes (e.g., birth, miscarriage) were more common for SMW than heterosexual women.”

In fact, the abortion and birth rates of non-heterosexually identified women is roughly twice that of the heterosexual population. That is a whole lot of baby-making sex going on among women who were supposedly “born lesbian.”

Leading gender theorists have long established that female sexuality, contrary to that of males, is extremely malleable. Professor Lisa Diamond is a giant in this field. In an important TEDx Talk, she explained, “The plain truth is that gender and sexual development show a lot more variability than most people realize, and that variability often leads to change over time in sexual attraction. . . . Sexual attractions show a fair amount of fluidity.”

This is because, Diamond explains, “women are . . . more likely than men to say that they become attracted to—or fall in love with—the person and not the gender.” As such, “women typically report that their unusually strong emotional feelings spill over into sexual desire— . . . even desires that contradict their sexual orientations—as a result of falling in love.” Diamond’s most notable publication is her book “Sexual Fluidity: Understanding Women’s Love and Desire,” published by Harvard University Press.

Another leader in the field, Northwestern University’s J. Michael Bailey, infamously asked in a classic paper whether women even have a sexual orientation as we typically think about it. He explains, “There is an emerging consensus that women’s sexual partner choices are sometimes made for different reasons than men’s.”

“Men,” Bailey adds, “but not women, have a category-specific sexual arousal pattern, one that is usually directed more strongly to members of one sex than to those of the other.” He and his peers in the field conclude that, in general, men have a sexual orientation toward certain body parts. Women have a romantic orientation to the person. This understanding has gained near-universal consensus and explains the high pregnancy rates of so-called lesbians.

Women Must Kneel to Men in Lesbian Bars

Still, lesbianism, such as it is, is also being smashed by the intolerant patriarchy of transgenderism. This is no small thing. The lesbian bar is no longer a women’s space because, the Lesbian Bar Project claims, “the label Lesbian belongs to all people who feel that it empowers them.”

This is lesbian sisterhood being forced to submit to men under the patriarchal guise of trans inclusivity. In the good old days, any self-respecting lesbian could tell a man who insisted on buying her a drink where he could go and be cheered a feminist hero for doing so. Today, if that same man wears a pencil skirt and claims to be trans, that lesbian becomes the worst person in the world.

Herzog bravely and correctly observes, “Oddly, these fights only seem to occur around women’s space, not men’s.” That is because women who believe they are men know better than to sidle up to the gay bar insisting they are just one of the guys looking for a good time.

U.K. lesbian writer Claire Heuchan warns, “Everywhere you look, there are reminders of how little the safety and wellbeing of lesbian women is valued. We can’t seem to escape violence and vilification. Especially since, in recent months, a lot of it has come from within the LGBT communities we helped build. …[E]ven within LGBT spheres, where we are – at least theoretically – part of the community, lesbians are now being vilified.”

Women being forced to bow to the needs of men. Who saw this happening when gender theory tried to convince us that men and women are all just the same?

"Chris Pratt's Character Came Out, Renewing Bigotry Against Christians","Corporate media, especially LGBT media, seem to have a special hobby of attempting to make conservatives, particularly Christians, as uncomfortable as possible in public. This becomes more apparent when they consider their target to be especially deserving of harassment and bullying, such as actor Chris Pratt.

Popsugar, for example, gleefully declared, “Guardians of the Galaxy’s Star-Lord Is Bisexual, and All Eyes Are on Chris Pratt.” The article imagines and mocks a hypothetically scared, sad, and outraged Pratt finding out his most famous character has come out, and he can barely contain himself. Pratt has yet to comment on the revelation.

With a cover photo of Pratt sneering in disgust, LGBTQ Nation headlined its take with, “Guardian of the Galaxy’s Star-Lord revealed as bisexual. Will Chris Pratt have a religious issue?” Again fantasizing about the actor’s personal beliefs, the website pondered, “Will … the actor who famously attends an anti-LGBTQ church be able to effectively play the character?”

As implied, every report on the development seems to feel it necessary to include that same characterization. Pratt is a member of Hillsong Church and has long been the target of mockery, anger, accusations, and public shaming for his Christian beliefs.

Hollywood Lashes Out at Pratt

In 2019, then-Ellen Page lashed out at Pratt without cause, demanding: “If you are a famous actor and you belong to an organization that hates a certain group of people, don’t be surprised if someone simply wonders why it’s not addressed. Being anti LGBTQ is wrong, there aren’t two sides. The damage it causes is severe. Full stop.”

Pratt had not said anything homophobic nor made fun of transgender people nor participated in any campaigns for legislation considered anti-LGBT. He had done nothing more than be a Christian and continue working in Hollywood without being ashamed of his faith.

Despite not doing anything to warrant the abuse from Page, Pratt responded in defense of his church, saying: “It has recently been suggested that I belong to a church which ‘hates a certain group of people’ and is ‘infamously anti-LGBTQ.’ Nothing could be further from the truth. I go to a church that opens their doors to absolutely everyone.” Nevertheless, the imaginary version of Pratt existing in the heads of left-wing and LGBT activists is still considered homophobic and bigoted to such a degree that they have even begun recasting the character.

Actor Daniel Newman, for example, demanded, “If Star-Lord is Bisexual now, then an Out Bisexual actor should be playing him!” Jon Cooper and Debra Messing, who recently faced backlash for wishing President Trump would be the victim of sexual assault in prison, agreed, with Cooper gleefully declaring, “If Star-Lord is bisexual now, then there’s no actor who’s better suited to play him!”

Pink News argued, “With Marvel Comics confirming that the legendary Star-Lord is bisexual, fans are hoping a future iteration of the character could be played by a bisexual actor.” Despite the film series “Guardians of the Galaxy” breaking records in revenue, with the first in the series being the best August release of all time in 2014, many seem ready to kick Pratt out of his iconic role.

The Revelation Is No Big Deal

Pratt is scheduled to portray the character again in two upcoming movies, and it’s unclear whether the new revelation will surface. In fact, in context, the revelation isn’t particularly groundbreaking.

The character, who has had a long-term relationship with one of the female main characters finds himself in a parallel universe for 150 years with only two other people, one man and one woman. After 12 years, he decides to enter a relationship with both of them. The story appears in the latest issue of the comic book, and there doesn’t look to be any prior history to it.

As an actor, Pratt pretends to be things he is not. Right now, he plays a character in an imaginary world where he is in love with a green, alien woman — it’s all fictional. There is also no indication that Pratt as a straight man would have any issues playing a gay or bisexual character, something only LGBT activists seem to be outraged over these days.

He is a married Christian, yet he portrays a sexually roguish, half-god character who has never been married to the character his character frequently has sex with. This isn’t a Bible story.

Why the Mockery?

More frustratingly, the left is obsessed with proper representation and ensuring actors of differing faiths or who belong to the LGBT community have a say in the characters they play. Zeeko Zaki, who stars in “FBI,” is Muslim and wrote of how he grew up with negative Muslim stereotypes. He says this influenced the role he took, which was meant for a Latino character, to be inclusive of Islamic and Egyptian heritage. Marvel has taken care to ensure Muslim actors have a say in their characters, as Faran Tahir discussed, saying he helped prevent negative stereotypes from being used in his portrayal in the 2008 film “Iron Man.”

These actors are accommodated personally, so why is Pratt so freely mocked by people who want to force him into potentially uncomfortable positions in his own career just because he is a Christian? The simplest answer is that the left believes he deserves it because of his religious affiliation, their stereotypical prejudices, and the fact that he belongs to a popular church that views sexuality in a way they believe to be abhorrent.

Their joy in attacking Pratt comes from a place of petty vengeance and bigotry, and they feel completely justified. Pratt always responds respectfully to this kind of hateful ignorance, and I am sure he will address this issue perfectly fine.

We should recognize these bullies for who they are, however. It is the LGBT activists who are mocking a man for possibly being forced to choose between his personal beliefs and his career for their own amusement.

"Nasdaq Wants To Push Companies To Hire Fewer White, Straight Men","Wall Street has always hated Main Street. Never before, however, has it been so open and brazen in wielding that animus. Take, for example, Nasdaq’s recent pronouncement that it plans to delist any company from its exchange that won’t appoint board members based on how they look, whether they have sex with the “right” people, or identify as a letter in the LGBT lexicon.

Nasdaq’s dictate is wholly unconstitutional, panders to minority groups and women, and would financially strain many American businesses. Still, it’s pushing forward anyway because it thinks no one will have the courage to stand up and stop it.

Specifically, Nasdaq is seeking permission from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to delist any American company from its platform unless the company puts two “diverse” individuals on its board of directors. One position must be given to a female. And one position must be given to a racial minority or a member of the ever-broadening definition of LGBT.

This is the definition of racism and sexism, which are illegal in U.S. employment, but it’s also the state of play in corporate America: Follow the leftist political directives of the Wall Street and Davos crowds, or lose the ability to finance your business in the public marketplace. Where can we begin to unpack this wholly backward plan, and how did we get here?

For starters, this scheme has precisely nothing to do with financial performance. In its petition to the SEC, Nasdaq doesn’t claim minority or female board membership leads to increased corporate performance. It simply cites debunked studies claiming that such board diversity is “positively associated” with better financial performance. This confuses causation with correlation, a logical fallacy known as post hoc ergo propter hoc (“after this, therefore because of this”).

Nowhere does Nasdaq say that financial performance improves because a company increased the surface-characteristic diversity of its board, only that in some cases, financial performance improved after a diverse board member was added. You could just as easily conduct a “study” showing that companies that instituted Pizza Fridays or Ice Cream Wednesdays saw improved financial performance after the fact. For such a study to have any validity, it must show that the first action caused the subsequent result. In short, Nasdaq failed to prove its work.

Yet it gets worse. Another likely illegal aspect of Nasdaq’s plan is that a company can bypass the minority requirement by appointing to its board a white male who identifies as LGBT. It is entirely against the law, however, to ask any job applicant for his or her sexual orientation.

So, if a company complies with Nasdaq’s demands, and ends up with a board comprised of one female and the rest all white males, the company just potentially (and publicly) outed one of those men LGBT. Surely not every single member of those groups wants that information made public.

Let’s be clear-eyed about what Nasdaq is doing, beyond expressing its ideological commitment to identity politics. It is trying to set up a system similar to tenure for professors in higher education. Whatever its possible noble origins and designs to protect academic freedom, tenure has become nothing more than a means to blackball conservative academics from college campuses.

The left has been so successful at blocking conservative thought in academia that, according to the National Association of Scholars, “faculty political affiliations at 39 percent of the top-tier liberal arts colleges … are Republican free — having zero Republicans … and 78.2 percent of the academic departments … have either zero Republicans or so few as to make no difference.” This is exactly what is already occurring in corporate boardrooms and what Nasdaq is trying to accelerate.

A 2019 survey conducted by Barron Public Affairs compared the ideological makeup of the board members of the Fortune 100 companies with any prior political experience. In the Fortune 1-10, the split was 100 percent Democrat and 0 percent Republican.

Among the financial companies in the Fortune 1-100, the split was 83 percent Democrat and 17 percent Republican. Nasdaq is trying to fast-track the left’s complete takeover of corporate America by ensuring that board seats are now rewarded to leftists — thereby keeping any businessmen with conservative or traditional values out of the club.

Because in today’s environment no CEO would dare challenge the liberal mob, Nasdaq expects its request will go unchallenged. Therefore, it’s up to the Americans who prioritize business success over virtue signaling to do something about it.

And you can. The SEC is accepting public comments regarding Nasdaq’s request until January 4, 2021. We at the Free Enterprise Project just submitted our comment blasting Nasdaq’s gambit. You can submit your comment here. Don’t let the mob win.

How Biden Will Open The Floodgates To Transgendering Public Schools,"The next several years are likely to reopen the floodgates to leftists’ long repurposing of public schools to indoctrinate children with lies about sex. According to leftist reporting, once in office Joe Biden plans to quickly use executive power to push transgenderism in schools, farther than President Obama did. In Congress, Democrats plan to prioritize legislation to do the same, potentially with Republican support, with the so-called Equality Act and more.

On Nov. 7, Biden was reportedly the first candidate to mention transgenderism in his speech claiming he had won the presidency. This is only the tip of the iceberg. On the campaign trail, Biden promised to reinstate President Obama’s requirement that public schools put boys in girls’ sports and showers, and push this issue much more.

“I will flat out just change the law, eliminate those executive orders. There should be zero discrimination,” Biden said of Trump’s transgender policies in October to the mother of an eight-year-old child she claims is transgender.

“Joe Biden said that on his first day of office, he will give transgender students access to sports, bathrooms and locker rooms in accordance with their gender identity in all federally funded schools,” (emphasis added) a reporter said to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer after the election, in December. “Do you think he has the ability to do this and do you agree with his decision?”

“I agree with the decision and I know he’ll check things out thoroughly, legally,” Schumer responded.

In its “LGBTQ Policy” document, Biden’s campaign states:

On his first day in office, Biden will reinstate the Obama-Biden guidance revoked by the Trump-Pence Administration, which will restore transgender students’ access to sports, bathrooms, and locker rooms in accordance with their gender identity. He will direct his Department of Education to vigorously enforce and investigate violations of transgender students’ civil rights.

Many Ways to Screw Children When Adults Don’t Care

Now let’s refresh what we’ve already seen in schools with the encouragement of the Obama administration and leftist judges, which Biden has openly promised to revive. Some of this would happen without federal pressure, but there is no doubt that federal pressure accelerates and expands this publicly funded assault on children.

If you don’t think this is twisted, you are. If you believe in the legitimacy of any politician, institution, or school that is willing to countenance any of this, you are a morally bankrupt fool.

All of this will be accelerated under a Biden administration. This is not conjecture. He and his campaign have publicly pledged to do it.

I would like every “principled” whitewashed tomb of a pundit who told us Biden was “the moral choice” to stick all this up their pipes and light it on fire. They are willing to sacrifice girls’ bodies for their pride. That is beneath contempt.

Creepy Obsession with Naked Kids

Since Democrats are used to zero effective pushback from their neutered political opposition, they make many of their insane plans quite public. So we can predict quite clearly how Biden’s administration plans to expand upon the above track record.

In his policy document, Biden pledges to use federal agencies to prosecute schools that do not completely fulfill LGBT demands for putting naked children of both sexes together. He promises to apply the Obama administration’s suspension of school discipline for children of favored racial identity groups also to children of favored sexual behaviors. He promises to use schools to punish teachers and children for saying the truth about the sexes, and indoctrinate them to believe the left’s depraved views of sexuality that conflict with the views of all major world religions.

Biden also promises to excuse minors who identify as LGBT from penalties for committing crimes (yes, that’s really in his plan). He plans to create federal orphanages for LGBT youth who run away from their homes, and put transgender males into shelters for women. This would also be accomplished via the Equality Act that Biden supports and congressional Democrats plan to prioritize immediately upon him taking office.

All schools that receive federal funding, Biden’s plan says, will be required to treat people as the sex they claim to be. This would apply to not just K-12 schools but also preschools and higher education programs that receive federal funding, which is nearly all the nation’s higher education institutions.

This means your freshman daughter could be placed with a male as her college roommate and the Biden administration could prosecute the school if it allows her to switch. It means athletes staying overnight for away games could be forced to room with a kid of the opposite sex without even being informed of that in advance.

Remember, in its “Overnight Housing” section in the Obama Title IX regulations Biden pledges to reinstate, “a school must allow transgender students to access housing consistent with their gender identity and may not require transgender students to stay in single-occupancy accommodations or to disclose personal information when not required of other students. ”

Leftist Religion Makes War On Ancient Religions

If the Biden administration truly does apply this to all institutions that receive federal funding, these transgender diktats will apply to most private and religious institutions as well. Numerous private K-12 schools participate in federal programs such as school lunch. Numerous religious institutions that deal with children, such as foster and adoption agencies, camps, after-school care, and preschools, could also be affected.

Another avenue a Biden administration could use to force-feed children sexual confusion is the accreditation process. Colleges cannot receive federal funds, including student loans, which are now essentially nationalized, if they are not accredited through a federally approved agency. The accreditation process is already used to control colleges’ curricula and campus atmosphere by requiring institutionalized racism and sexism such as through quotas. It can also be used to force schools to transgender students.

Leftists have already been exploring this avenue. A California bill “would have pulled state and federal college subsidies from students who attend religious colleges unless those colleges strip their distinctive religious practices, especially in the areas of human sexuality and theology instruction.” The Obama administration also considered accreditation and personnel regulations that would have forced religious colleges to lie about God or lose federal funds.

The LGBT organization Human Rights Campaign recently made policy recommendations to the Biden administration that included pulling federal funds from all faithful Christian, Muslim, and Jewish institutions by banning their beliefs through the accreditation process. If a school is not accredited, its students may not benefit from the GI bill, transfer credits, or apply for graduate study, noted Southern Baptist Theological Seminary leader Al Mohler.

“This would mean abandoning biblical standards for teaching, hiring, admissions, housing, and student life. It would mean that Christian schools are no longer Christian,” he wrote.

Leftist activists have spent the Trump administration projecting their bigotry onto religious schools, starting controversies over the fact that parents use vouchers to pick schools for their children that don’t subscribe to leftist sexual ideology. A year ago, Wells Fargo and Fifth Third banks pulled millions of dollars in donations from scholarships for poor black children because those children’s parents had chosen to use them in Christian schools. Numerous “journalists” have been using their platforms to get Christian schools defunded this way by slandering their religious beliefs as “bigoted.” Expect all this to intensify and get federal assistance.

Many More Kids Are Going to Need Lots of Therapy

Don’t forget, the Supreme Court handed Biden another accelerant to this entire agenda by rubber-stamping the Obama bureaucracy’s garbage interpretation of the word “sex” as including the ridiculous concept of “gender identity.” The evil consequences will be applied to all religious and reality-based institutions possible over the next generation — unless Americans refuse to comply with this obviously insane and destructive lie. Any backup from politicians half of us elect would help, but none has so far been forthcoming.

In the absence of moral courage among most parents and politicians, American children continue to suffer. As I’ve noted before, “both earlier and increased exposure to sexual material increases children’s risky behavior — such as unprotected sex, multiple partners, and violence — and damages their mental health.” We’ve seen that in the past several years with growing mental health problems among the young and the unnatural spike in claims of gender dysphoria, especially among teenage girls. They are told to cut off developing breasts and take off-label drugs with life-altering destructive effects.

It seems all even the most energetic parents are willing to do about the prospect of their daughters being forced to be naked in a room with a penis, or encouraged to cut their breasts off and take drugs to assist HIV-positive sex, is impotently complain at school board meetings, after which the board votes against them and their school keeps getting its usual tax funding. The majority of parents don’t even do that. All of us continue to pretend institutions that countenance this assault on human nature have any moral legitimacy whatsoever.

It’s no wonder politicians don’t believe parents and grandparents care about little girls’ and boys’ innocence and safety when so few do anything to protect children except maybe yell at Fox News once in a while. Our politicians are just like we are: If they say the right things too many of us excuse their lack of follow-up, and everyone marches home to watch Netflix.

If parents pulled their children from any school where seeing penises and breasts was even a possibility by someone who doesn’t have the same equipment, or where trans ideology was treated as a reasonable or legitimate point of view, this issue would resolve within three months. Democrats would never truly jeopardize their mind fog factories.

But too many Americans are lazy cowards who point fingers about problems instead of doing what it takes to solve them, because solving problems is hard and whining on Facebook is easy. Too many Americans want a nice car, comfy house in the “right neighborhood,” high school sports nostalgia, and frequent eating out more than they want to protect children from being mind raped by sweetly smiling kindergarten teachers and gawked at by emotionally disturbed peers and teachers.

Most likely, there will be backlash. But also most likely, Biden and Democrats will get away with most of this. In fact, they’re counting on it. They’ll all be dead when today’s generation of emotional wrecks grows up and gets nuked by China because the only things they know how to handle are a vibrator, cell phone, and lipstick.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/01/18/how-joe-biden-will-open-the-floodgates-to-transgendering-public-schools/,2021-01-18
PA Transgender Health Official Who Flopped COVID Response Is Elevated To Biden's Assistant Health Secretary,"President-elect Joe Biden nominated Dr. Rachel Levine, a transgender health official in Pennsylvania, on Tuesday to serve as assistant Health and Human Services secretary.

In the announcement, Biden praised Levine for the “steady leadership and essential expertise we need to get people through this pandemic.” He also noted that Levine is “a historic and deeply qualified choice to help lead our administration’s health efforts” and assist abortion extremist Health Secretary Xavier Becerra.

Before the pandemic, the GOP-controlled Senate in Pennsylvania confirmed Levine to multiple positions including secretary of health. Despite these confirmations, Levine has been criticized for failing to properly address the COVID-19 pandemic.

During massive outbreaks in nursing homes and assisted care facilities across the states, Levine’s own mother was removed from a personal care home, a decision that received criticism from many people, including those who still did not have access to their family members who remained vulnerable inside similar facilities.

Levine also received criticism after telling the press in November that people in Pennsylvania would likely have to wear masks through 2021, even after the vaccine rollout.

“We anticipate we’re going to be rolling this out through the winter and then into the spring and into the summer,” Levine told Penn Live. “It could take a significant amount of time to immunize everyone in Pennsylvania. I anticipate we’re going to be wearing masks well into 2021, maybe to the end of 2021.”

Choosing Levine as the first transgender federal official in the U.S. signals Biden’s commitment to an LGBT agenda push during his time in office. Not only did he pledge to sign the Equality Act to combat the “epidemic” of violence “against transgender and gender non-conforming people,” but the president-elect has also promised to roll back President Donald Trump’s executive orders concerning transgenderism.

“I will flat out just change the law, eliminate those executive orders. There should be zero discrimination,” Biden said at a town hall in October, speaking to a mother concerned about her 8-year-old’s ability to live as transgender.

Biden’s current agenda for the LGBT community, which has earned the approval of soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, opens the door for the incoming administration to force schools that receive federal funding to accommodate students who want to use bathrooms and locker rooms and play sports with students of the opposite sex.

“Joe Biden said that on his first day of office, he will give transgender students access to sports, bathrooms, and locker rooms in accordance with their gender identity in all federally funded schools,” a reporter told Schumer. “Do you think he has the ability to do this and do you agree with his decision?”

“I agree with the decision and I know he’ll check things out thoroughly, legally,” Schumer replied.

Outrage Over Max Lucado Shows There Is No Room For Dissent In LGBT Church Politics,"If a “nicest guy in the world” award was given to famous American pastors, few would disagree New York Times best-selling author Max Lucado should find himself toward the front of that line. He’s the consummate cuddly bear whose central message is God’s boundless and unmerited grace for all people, regardless of their story. This is the hallmark of his ministry and life. It oozes from his pulpit and the pages of his books. He speaks of it in a thousand different ways, always seeking to help people understand this glorious truth from yet another creative, illuminating angle.

Lucado’s message is clear: No one is too far from God’s inexhaustible love. No. One. If you are human, this includes you. Full. Stop. All you have to do is accept it. It was this very message that earned him the prestigious invitation to preach this past Sunday to the congregation of the celebrated Washington National Cathedral in D.C. This is the church where our national leaders hold their largest and most solemn official religious gatherings.

But Lucado’s invitation to preach was surprisingly controversial and his cancelation was publicly demanded, according to the Episcopal News Service. Why? Because he has publicly stated that God instituted marriage between a man and woman and only condones married sexuality. And his great “sin” was not so much how he said it, but that he said it. This was enough to spur calls for his cancelation and for the National Cathedral’s leadership to say letting Lucado speak was a “mistake.”

When the Washington National Cathedral announced on their Facebook page Lucado would be preaching their Sunday service, calls for him to be disinvited flooded in. Someone on the Cathedral’s Facebook page baselessly explained, “This man’s theology makes some people want to kill themselves.” The director of faith outreach for the highly influential LGBT lobbying group Human Rights Campaign made their thoughts known about the invitation to church leadership. Activists started an online petition to have Lucado’s invitation rescinded.

Pastor Lucado’s message was delivered to the congregation on February 7th. But only after retired Bishop Gene Robinson, the Episcopal Church’s first ordained openly gay bishop, was recruited to preside over the Sunday morning service as a calming device. Robinson provided a meticulously worded eight minute-long explanation for why Lucado’s was invitation was not revoked. To his credit, Robison’s speech was a thoughtful and a classical liberal explanation for why inclusion “sometimes … includes people we don’t agree with much at all.” But he put his explanation to the congregation in the simple and binary context of good over bad, right over wrong, us against them.

Let me just say this carefully to those of us who are LGBTQ. …We’ve won. We’ve won! We know how this is going to end. This is going to end with the full inclusion of gay and lesbian, bisexual, transgender, queer people, non-binary people, all kinds of people. We know how it ends.

He concluded his side the zero-sum victors, “good” over “evil.” That pulpit is their pulpit and they will manage it according to their ascendent beliefs. And Rev. Randy Hollerith, dean of Washington National Cathedral, was also compelled to distance himself from his gentle guest during the Sunday service and did so in his carefully threaded introduction to Lucado’s sermon.

Max and I differ on many issues, but I know him to be a person of goodwill and deep faith. …He has said things in the past that have caused the LGBTQ community great pain. Let me be clear. I don’t agree with those statements. And the Cathedral does not agree with those statements. Our LGBTQ brothers and sisters and siblings are the beloved children of God, just as they are.

Lucado’s basic position on the nature of marriage and sexuality is what made his invitation a bridge too far for the LGBT political class. This incident demonstrates it is no longer possible to hold a belief contrary to LGBT orthodoxy, even in the most genuinely kind and gracious way, and still be considered a decent person by those on the left. It is no longer a matter of how you disagree, but simply that you disagree. That is the take-away here. And every person involved in this decision got the message loud and clear.

Washington, D.C.’s Episcopal Bishop Mariann Budde told the Episcopal News Service, “I would do it differently now” regarding Lucado’s invitation. “My biggest mistake,” she explained, “was not reaching out to some of my colleagues who are LGBTQ.”

Budde, who certainly didn’t rise to her position in that denomination without being acutely mindful of and dutiful to LGBT concerns, confessed, “It took me a while to appreciate the magnitude of the issue and the magnitude of the concern” from those who protested the invitation. Hollerith said, “In my straight privilege I failed to see and fully understand the pain he has caused.” Gay activists’ most faithful allies have a hard time keeping up with their demands.

It is critically important for all Christians, and any informed observer of religion in public life, to take note of what this incident marks. Two of the most powerful Episcopal clergy in the nation had to carefully explain, within minutes of his talk, why an evangelical preacher whose whole message is God’s limitless kindness and grace to everyone should be allowed to address the Sunday morning congregation of one of our nation’s great cathedrals. They admitted Lucado’s sermon that morning titled, “How God Helps Us Through Our Trials,” was not controversial in any way.

This pastor is not political, nor a culture warrior, and their concern was with what he wrote 17 years ago. His singular message is God’s unending love for everyone. He has sold over a hundred million books explaining that very truth. His disqualifying feature was not greed, arrogance, graft, sexual misconduct, or abuse of power. It was not ugliness toward any person. It is simply and singularly that he holds to the historic and clearly scriptural teaching of what marriage is as God’s clearly stated plan for human sexual expression, that which is held by nearly all major religions through the millennia and most clergy today.

To this, all orthodox Christians, Jews, and Muslims, as well as any other traditionally-minded individuals, should ask their LGBT neighbors this question: Is it possible for me to not agree with what you believe about sexuality and gender and still be considered a decent person in polite company?

Max Lucado got the answer to those questions this week in a dramatically stark fashion. Yes, Pastor Lucado was permitted to speak, but only by the skin of his teeth. And only with very public and deft distancing from the very people who invited him. Even the liberal clergy of the Episcopal Church received the message loud and clear: Don’t invite his kind ever again. No matter how nice and inclusive they might be. It’s not how you disagree. It’s that you disagree.

This turn should jolt everyone who values civil society, the necessity of religious freedom, and the essential virtue of differing ideas. A new kind of fundamentalism is taking over liberalism, and it is doing so ironically, in the name of inclusion and free-thought. The Lucado incident is simply the latest dramatic dispatch in that story.

Activists Try To Ban Researchers From Studying Transgender People,"LGBT activists previously argued gender dysphoria may be affirmed by discoveries about individuals’ genetics and brain development. Harvard University researchers, for example, explored this viewpoint in depth in a 2016 article titled “Between the (Gender) Lines: the Science of Transgender Identity.”

In studies published in 1995 and 2000, researchers looked at specific areas of the brain in both transgender adults and those who accept their sex. They found that male to female transgender people had specific brain areas more closely resembling that of gender-natural women, and the same for transgender men (females living as men).

The researchers also studied transgender people not taking hormones, and found similar results. They argued this indicates transgender people may be born with brains somewhat akin to those of the opposite sex, either due to genetics or hormone exposure as a fetus.

Further exploration into questions like this should greatly benefit medical personnel in helping effectively treat transgender patients. However, LGBT activists seem to have made a drastic ideological shift towards opposing efforts.

The University of California at Los Angeles’s Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior was preparing a National Institute of Health-backed study to better understand brain structures and responses among people living with gender dysphoria. The study was titled, “Gender identity and own body perception – implications for the neurobiology of gender dysphoria.” Its researchers were seeking transgender participants when LGBT activists demanded the study be shut down.

According to the physicians attempting to conduct the study, “We want to understand the neurobiology of gender dysphoria and the interactions between sex hormone therapy treatment, the brain, and the body phenotype.” However, the executive director of the local activist group Gender Justice LA objected, claiming the study “opens the door for advancing the highly disregarded and dangerous practice of conversion therapy.”

Gender Justice LA claims the study is designed to “trigger” gender dysphoria in those who have not begun treatment and therefore would be psychologically harmful to the participants. They asserted that because the study could be used “for the creation of therapeutics to treat gender dysphoria as one would treat anorexia” it could be used as a method of conversion therapy.

The California LGBTQ Health and Human Services Network circulated a letter to local LGBT communities urging transgender and gender-nonconforming people to stay away from the “dangerous” study.

“We object to the view that transgender people have an aberrant body image condition or that brain imaging of traumatic response could ultimately ‘help’ trans people,” the group wrote in the letter. “It is suggestive of a search for medical ‘cure,’ which can open the door for more gatekeeping and restrictive policies and practices in relation to access to gender-affirming care. At a time in which trans lives are under attack, we find this kind of research to be misguided and dangerous.”

Seemingly shocked by the backlash, the leading physician has paused the study until meetings with local LGBT groups can be conducted to better understand the objections and adapt the study to address their concerns. However, this is unlikely to be effective. The California LGBTQ Health and Human Services Network named the lead doctor, Jamie Feusner, M.D., in their press release.

They complained that Feusner primarily studies eating disorders and body dysmorphic disorder, which is offensive to LGBT ideology, which wholly rejects the idea gender dysphoria is problematic. The organization claimed this study is proof all similar studies must first go through research review boards by TGI (transgender, gender-nonconforming and intersex) organizations.

Part of their demands of the university is to, “Create clear research guideless that include the participation of transgender researchers and policy advocates on scientific advisory boards and community advisory boards for any trans related research.” This would ban any independent research that transgender activists do not wish to be conducted. Rather than open research as broadly as possible to better understand the condition, LGBT activists want to carefully control and monitor research to ensure preferred outcomes.

How would understanding the chemical responses in the brains of people living with gender dysphoria, with or without hormone therapy, be harmful to transgender people? It appears to come down to LGBT movement stances about the erasure of biological sex distinctions in favor of gender identity.

The American Civil Liberties Union’s list of “facts” about transgender athletes argues, “There is no one way for our bodies to be. Women, including women who are transgender, intersex, or disabled, have a range of different physical characteristics. Biological sex and gender are not binaries. There are no set hormone ranges, body parts, or chromosomes that all people of a particular sex or gender have.”

The movement seems to be focused exclusively on pushing affirmation and transition rather than understanding the cause or nature of gender dysphoria any longer. The Daily Wire helpfully debunked the ACLU’s “facts.”

Additionally, more and more emphasis has been placed on early and aggressive social transition with the use of puberty blockers in children. As LGBTQ Nation reported, “A new study found that transgender teens who are prescribed puberty blockers want to take them and then later undergo hormone replacement therapy.”

Many critical of gender-transition therapy have observed that early social transition causes later physical transition, especially once puberty blockers are introduced. The messaging from these groups is clear that identity matters more than biology.

Based on the arguments being made and opposition to a better scientific understanding of gender dysphoria, it is clear LGBT activists worry that science may become a barrier to gender identity advocacy. A reliable brain scan demonstrating a female brain in a male body, which was once used as evidence of the inborn nature of gender dysphoria, could become a test for the condition. In the eyes of activists, this could restrict or limit access to transition if research suggests gender dysphoria should be medically diagnosed before transition can be justified.

Rather, the LGBT movement prefers the argument that gender is, quite literally, what the individual says it is. The assertion that a transwoman is a woman requires no evidence, and is expected to be accepted at face value. Scientific research narrowing the causes or nature of gender dysphoria could upset this argument.

Rather than evaluate their views based on what science finds, LGBT activists instead are simply shutting down study that threatens their beliefs. The influence of this population over medical science and study should be greatly concerning to everyone interested in pursuing scientific truth wherever it leads, rather than using it solely as a tool to obtain a preferred outcome.

Wisconsin's Capital City Is Trying To Ban White People From Police Board,"When Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. took to the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in 1963 to deliver his famous “I Have a Dream” speech, he offered Americans, of all races, a compelling vision of a society no longer prejudiced by race. He envisioned a country where citizens are judged “by the content of their character” and not “the color of their skin.”

But to listen to today’s most prominent “antiracists,” King’s dream is what stands in the way of racial justice in 21st-century America. The result is the return of legal racial discrimination.

In Madison, Wisconsin, the famously leftist city government recently established a Police Civilian Oversight Board in response to activists concerned with police relations. The board’s mission is rather vague: “provide input,” “engage in community outreach,” and “make policy-level recommendations.” What the board is not vague about is who is allowed to participate.

Six of the board’s 11 members must be black. No Asians, American Indian, Hispanics or Latinos, or Whites can sit in those six seats: “Blacks Only,” to use the terminology of the City’s Alder Workgroup, which explicitly mandated “50 percent Black members.”

Furthermore, one board seat is reserved for an Asian; one board seat is reserved for an American Indian; one board seat is reserved for someone identifying as “Latinx.” Finally, one board seat is reserved for a “member of the LGBTQ community,” although the city presumably would allow someone to be both a minority and LGBTQ at the same time.

Heralded as a serious effort at “equity” and “inclusion,” Madison’s Police Civilian Oversight Board intentionally discriminates based on racial categories—a practice with an ugly and pernicious past. This is also the vision of America’s most prominent “antiracists.” For example, in his 2019 book, “How to be an Antiracist,” best-selling author Ibram X. Kendi is explicit that, “The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.”

Unfortunately, Madison is not alone in this kind of legal racism. California now imposes racial quotas on private companies’ boards. NASDAQ is following suit. Many private companies, such as Delta Airlines and Wells Fargo, are promising to impose quotas.

Regardless of the intent or the current zeitgeist on racial justice, intentional race discrimination remains illegal, unconstitutional, and contrary to basic American values. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has written that “racial paternalism and its unintended consequences can be as poisonous and pernicious as any other form of discrimination.”

Our Constitution’s aim of a colorblind society, embodied in the Equal Protection Clause, was “[p]urchased at the price of immeasurable suffering,” and any racial classifications, whether for good intentions are not, “have a destructive impact on the individual and society” and “demean[ ] us all,” according to Justice Thomas, who is black.

Since 1978, the U.S. Supreme Court has struck down racial quotas every time they have reared their ugly head. Given the energy and momentum to establish new racial quotas, however, the courts can expect to be tested in new ways on their commitment to justice and equal protection.

In Madison, seven residents, represented by attorneys from the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, have challenged the unconstitutional racial quotas. If the city does not withdraw its ordinance and re-constitute the board with legal criteria, the city can expect a lawsuit. If the current cultural climate remains, it won’t be the last.

This all adds up to a treacherous moment for King’s dream. While slavery and Jim Crow’s legacy have not been undone easily, America has made important progress, although halting and stumbling at times, since the 1960s.

But resurrecting legal racial discrimination in the name of progress is no progress at all. It may be the preferred strategy of the “antiracists” who have rocketed to fame and credibility among many in elite American institutions, but it represents a dead-end for a diverse country still committed to equality before the law and the proposition that “all men are created equal.”",https://thefederalist.com/2021/02/19/wisconsins-capital-city-is-trying-to-ban-white-people-from-police-oversight-board/,2021-02-19
Snapchat Is A Transgender Propaganda And Grooming Machine,"Warning: This article includes sexual content that is inappropriate for children.

During a Thursday Senate confirmation hearing, Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul pressed President Joe Biden’s transgender nominee for assistant Health and Human Services secretary, Rachel Levine.

“Do you believe that minors are capable of making such a life-changing decision as changing one’s sex?” Paul asked. Levine wouldn’t answer.

Why would it be controversial to make sure people are of consenting age before they undergo irreversible plastic surgery? Answer: the culture.

The number of transgender Gen Zers is about 10 times higher than that of their parents in Generation X. In a tweet Wednesday, The Daily Wire’s Matt Walsh pointed out that the uptick in gender-dysphoric children is not a “natural or organic development.” It is the result of popular culture and our corrupt school system “actively recruit[ing] children into the LGBT ranks.”

The number of kids who identify as LGBT, especially trans and bisexual, has absolutely skyrocketed. If you think this is a natural or organic development, you're deluded. The media, Hollywood, and the school system actively recruit children into the LGBT ranks. pic.twitter.com/xqzZ5OaJ8U — Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) February 24, 2021

Walsh is absolutely right, and Snapchat is the transgender lobby’s greatest ally for indoctrinating and recruiting young people. A 2020 study found Snapchat is the most popular social media among U.S. teens (TikTok is a close second).

Snapchat’s content is short-lived and always disappearing, so parents have no way of keeping tabs on what their kids are seeing. It tends to fly under the radar because older conservatives give more attention to Twitter and Facebook, but because Snapchat is dominated by young people, it is arguably the most influential and dangerous app.

In 2015, Snapchat introduced “Discover,” a feature for publishers such as CNN, Complex, The New York Times, Mashable, People, Vice, and Vox to showcase short, ad-supported content. Snapchat also offers smaller brands and content creators a platform, such as the famous left-wing podcast “Pod Save America.”

There is no free marketplace of ideas in the Discover section. Snapchat’s editorial team has total control over its content. Millennial editors in Silicon Valley carefully hand-select radical leftist propaganda to give straight to children.

LGBT content is very prevalent on Snapchat, and transgender content is specially common. Below is some of the trans propaganda on Snapchat.

‘Twin Sisters Become Twin Brothers’

One of the biggest promoters of transgenderism is the Snapchat series “My Extraordinary Family.” The latest episode is titled “Twin Sisters Become Twin Brothers.”

‘We’re Judged For Letting Both Our Kids Transition’

A past episode from “My Extraordinary Family” is titled “We’re Judged For Letting Both Our Kids Transition.” The oldest child, James, born a girl, asked to go transgender at eight years old. This past year, the daughter changed her name to James and started hormone blockers.

Olivia, their other child, born a boy, said he was trans at four years old. The parents let him socially transition at five. “As of right now, we just follow her lead,” says Olivia’s mother.

‘Queer Icon’ and ‘Drag Makeup’

‘Drag My Dad’ and ‘Guys Try On Extreme V-day Lingerie’

Degrading and undermining masculinity is a common theme on Snapchat. “Drag My Dad” is an MTV Snapchat series featuring “Bob the drag queen,” who “is bringing families together by taking your typical macho, goofy dad and transforming him into the ultimate drag fantasy.”

And here is a recent episode called “Guys Try On Extreme V-day Lingerie” from “The Try Guys,” a group of straight millennial men who are famous for trying on women’s clothing.

“Guys Try On Extreme V-Day Lingerie” pic.twitter.com/xvnsQWLK0I — Evita Duffy (@evitaduffy_1) February 26, 2021

The content on Snapchat is calculated. Snapchat “news” only includes left-wing publishers. You won’t find Fox News, Newsmax, OAN, or The Federalist on Snapchat. “The Ben Shapiro Show” is the only conservative series featured on Discover, and that was a very recent addition.

Gender transitioning is a growing multibillion-dollar industry and the radical left and their corporate lobbyists want to continue capitalizing on it. Just like other Big Tech giants have decided to partner with the corporate media and Democratic Party, so has Snapchat. There is a strong pro-trans theme on Discover, making Snapchat a propaganda machine for the young people who scroll its feed.

Government is always two steps behind the culture. The reason Levine has been nominated and the reason it’s normal to refuse to recognize the inherent abuse in allowing children to mutilate their bodies is that the left has been rewiring Americans, especially American children, via the culture for decades. Snapchat is just one piece of the puzzle. There are many, many forces in the culture driving the same narrative.

Snapchat has undoubtedly contributed to the damaging uptick in trans children. This should concern everyone. Even the transgender advocacy organization World Professional Association for Transgender Health reports that the vast majority of gender-dysphoric children will ultimately align with their biology if allowed to go through puberty normally, without transgender treatments. Instead, grown-ups with an LGBT agenda aren’t allowing children to go through their gender-confused phase without inflicting permanent damage to their bodies.

Tragically, people like James, whose parents “let them lead,” might find themselves living with an irreversible sex change after they finally realize they want to live the rest of their lives as the sex they were born with.

How Ryan Anderson's Banned Book Helped Me With Gender Dysphoria,"In July 2017, I took a risk and submitted an article to a publication that I respected and read frequently, hoping to provide conservatives a perspective they may not have viewed before. I wanted to address why suicide was so high among transgender people and ask questions about transition I hadn’t seen asked by mainstream LGBT sources.

I wanted to present my voice as a person who experienced gender dysphoria, pursued transition, then later found myself grateful I didn’t go through with it. So with nervousness, I sent the article to Public Discourse, the online journal of the Witherspoon Institute.

I’d hoped for a positive reply, but I didn’t expect a response from Ryan T. Anderson, a conservative voice I had respected for a long time. He thanked me for sending my story. Ryan took a risk on me, an amateur writer, and offered me my first professional writing opportunity. He also published another personal story about my experience with gender dysphoria. Throughout both interactions, he was kind, generous with feedback and recommendations, and interested in what I had to say.

When his breakthrough book, “When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment,” was published, I excitedly downloaded it to my vast Audible library. To say his book was eye-opening is to provide a vague description. I had not heard the arguments he made before, nor read through the scientific research and other objective examinations of the condition and its effects the way Anderson presented it before. I also had not heard stories of other people who had gone through what I had until then.

I Thought I Was the Only One

I rarely discussed my gender dysphoria because I never transitioned, and I assumed something was unusual about me. I connected emotionally with most transgender stories right up until they began medical intervention and then I felt out of place and truly alone.

In many ways, I saw myself as a failure because the only transgender stories I encountered were those who accomplished what felt impossible for me. I was embarrassed to even bring up the topic because I didn’t want to have to answer the humiliating questions about why I stayed trapped in the “wrong” body all these years, or admit something inside me kept me from moving forward.

Anderson shared deep, rich stories by people just like me who did transition and then realized it was a mistake. Then they faced rebuilding the body and the identity they socially and medically altered in pursuit of some intangible goal of idealized gender.

Their understanding of discomfort in their bodies resonated loudly with me, even more than the initial concept of being transgender. I saw my struggle in their accomplishments, and I realized how truly grateful I was to have hesitated earlier in my life. When I wrote my story and sent it to Public Discourse, I thought it was unique because I hadn’t seen it before. I didn’t know I was among many friends.

I soon realized Ryan’s work offered me so much more than just a sense of personal validation in my journey. He also offered me answers. The book goes in-depth into the science behind biological sex and what we understand about the human body and how it functions.

Anderson moves through the development of a human fetus into brain development and what science tells us can affect that development. He answers the question, to the best of his ability and using the most pertinent science available, why the argument in favor of gender identity over biology is flawed.

The arguments he makes are positioned within the compassionate and empathetic interest of a scientist trying to understand what is causing a person so much pain and what can truly be done to relieve it. Without ever dismissing the experience of the transgender person, he asks the important question, one I struggled with for years, of whether a medical transition is genuinely the best option to alleviate gender dysphoria and all the pain and suffering associated with it. He bravely challenges the arguments supporting pro-transgender therapy in children and imbues the reader with the information necessary to understand why.

The Left Is on a Book-banning Crusade

For years I have championed this book to those interested in fully understanding the transgender movement, its arguments, and how to challenge them on the science, especially regarding public policy. When I saw that Amazon had removed Anderson’s book without so much as leaving the listing, complete with its history of valuable commentary from other readers, my heart sank. When I found out that LGBT activists were cheering on the decision, I sighed with frustrated disappointment.

Anderson’s “When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment,” is not an anti-LGBT or anti-transgender work. Ryan is not anti-LGBT, and he was never dismissive or cruel to transgender people. His work is certainly a far cry from anything resembling “hate speech.”

Like Abigail Shrier’s, “Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters” and Dr. Debra Soh’s, “The End of Gender: Debunking the Myths About Sex and Identity in Our Society,” also targeted by LGBT activists for banning, Anderson’s book asks necessary questions that deserve to be given fair consideration and debated, not restricted from public view.

For people like me who may have gone years feeling alone and completely ignored by the popular discussion of gender identity, Ryan’s book gives us hope and understanding of ourselves and the options we have for our future.

That, in its simplest form, is the best argument for keeping this book and others like it available for people to consider and decide for themselves how to respond. Instead, LGBT activists seem to feel entitled to decide what information we should have access to so that we only make the choices they believe are best for us.

We live in an era of absolute human potential and knowledge. We have access to information and ideas beyond anything most people who ever lived could have dreamed possible, yet we find ourselves restricted by powerful, ideological Puritans who believe this freedom is dangerous. I hope that Amazon corrects this mistake before it causes further damage to the free ability to decide for yourself what you want to believe.

You can purchase Ryan’s book, “When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment,” directly from the publisher, Encounter Books.

The Explosion In Queer Sexuality Among Kids Is Not A Natural Trend,"A new Gallup poll published on Feb. 24 shows 1 in 6 Gen Z adults identify as LGBT. These results represent a remarkable jump from 2017, when 4.5 percent of Americans identified as LGBT, a number that has now risen to 5.6 percent just three years later.

The number of kids who identify as LGBT, especially trans and bisexual, has absolutely skyrocketed. If you think this is a natural or organic development, you're deluded. The media, Hollywood, and the school system actively recruit children into the LGBT ranks. pic.twitter.com/xqzZ5OaJ8U — Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) February 24, 2021

The increase is indeed dramatic, yet it doesn’t fully tell the whole story. Why? While the population of Americans identifying as LGBT has risen steadily since 2012, last year the question was expanded from a simple “yes” or “no” to LGBT identity to include specific categories to choose from. Only one identity group showed a dramatic increase: bisexual women.

Of the 5.6 percent of all adults who identify as LGBT, 3.1 percent identify as bisexual, making up 54.6 percent of all LGBT adults. When broken down to the Gen Z age group (those aged 18 to 23), 11.5 percent identify as bisexual. In contrast, 5.1 percent of millennials and only 1.8 percent of Gen X identify as such. Across the board, all other categories, which include gay, lesbian, transgender, and others, remained steady.

Phillip Hammack, a psychology professor and director of the Sexual and Gender Diversity Laboratory at the University of California, Santa Cruz responded with excitement to the survey:

The rigid lines around gender and sexuality are just opening up for everybody … Young people are just doing it. … they’re leading this revolution, and they’re forcing scientists to take a closer look.

The data, however, doesn’t quite argue that point. Women are more likely to identify as LGBT than men, with 4.3 percent identifying as bisexual and only 1.8 percent of men identifying the same.

One in ten high school students identify as LGBT. Of these, 75 percent are female, and 77 percent identify as bisexual. As detailed by the Washington Post, the Williams Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles has found that 35 percent of LGBT adults are bisexual women.

Further, Hammack argues that his research shows young women are more likely to identify as “non-binary” or “gender-fluid.” The Gallup poll didn’t provide the option to identify gender identity separately from sexual orientation, but more Gen Z adults identified as transgender than as lesbian.

So why are young women exceedingly more likely to identify as neither gender and bisexual? The argument that today’s society is more accepting and readily allows people to be their true selves doesn’t account for this exclusive, targeted change in women.

Neither does the argument for a genetic or natural human biological component. The poll does not indicate a rise in LGBT Americans — it tells us gay and transgender numbers are stable and, yet, very suddenly, there has been an increase in bisexual women who reject female identity.

If the breakdown of celebrities who came out in 2020 is any indication, men overwhelmingly come out as gay while women tend to come out as bisexual, pansexual, or simply queer. In practice, bisexual identity, similar to non-binary and gender-fluid identity, may not require as big of a social change or commitment as being gay or transgender.

According to a Pew Research Center survey from Stanford University, nine in 10 bisexual people in a committed relationship are with someone of the opposite sex. This does not mean bisexuality is invalid as a sexual orientation or to suggest bisexual people are simply “going through a phase,” but identifying as bisexual doesn’t necessarily alter their lifestyle the way being gay or transgender would.

As Abigail Shrier discussed in great detail with in-depth research in her book, “Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters,” the power of social contagion and peer group identity is important to consider:

Between 2016 and 2017, the number of gender surgeries for natal females in the US quadrupled; in the UK, the rates of gender dysphoria for teenage girls are up 4,400 percent over the previous decade.

Indeed, as 16-year-old Jasper Swartz — who identifies as non-binary — expressed to the Washington Post, all of her friends are “queer in some way.”

Rather than reflecting the natural progression of openness to human variation in sexuality and gender identity, it seems to better reflect a pop culture fad to be included in the LGBT spectrum in any way possible. This seems especially true for younger people, who are inundated with LGBT education, culture, and positivity and, as Abigail discusses in her book, find meaning in being different, unique, and rebellious, along with their friends. As indicated by the Gallup survey, as people age, their identities become more stable and bisexuality drops significantly.

Like non-binary and gender-fluid identities, bisexuality also offers an even more unique form of social oppression because both sides of the spectrum are suspicious of true identity. Jenny Granados-Villatoro, 18, told the Post that her parents struggle to understand her identity as bisexual and gender fluid.

She reported, “They always ask me, ‘do you think you’re going to end up marrying a woman or a man? If I were to have come out as lesbian it would have definitely been an easier concept for them to grasp.” Grey-area identities may offer more social clout and sense of rebellion and uniqueness than traditional gay or transgender identities, but with less dramatic personal changes.

For young women seeking identity and being part of a special or important group, all they have to do is cut their hair short, dress like a boy, and declare themselves non-binary or bisexual to gain instant victimhood status and self-validation. If it becomes too much and they still get the exciting thrill of being LGBT, they can always slip back into safer roles. For advocates of female identity and rights like Shrier, this can be a dangerous place to be:

Anxiety-ridden, middle-class girls who once engaged in cutting or anorexia were now wearing ‘binders’ (breast-compressing undergarments), taking testosterone and undergoing voluntary double mastectomies.

Layshia Clarendon, a non-binary lesbian who plays for the WNBA, shared her “top surgery” on social media:

It’s hard to put into words the feeling of seeing my chest for the first time free of breasts, seeing my chest the way I’ve always seen it, and feeling a sense of gender euphoria as opposed to gender dysphoria … Sighhhh … freedom … freedom at last.

For young women, queer identity can often mean hiding or even removing all aspects of natural female attributes, whereas young queer men are encouraged to decorate themselves and blend masculine and feminine traits in celebration of all gender expression.

While LGBT media and advocacy insist on projecting a narrative of anti-LGBT hatred oppressing vulnerable LGBT youth, the reality appears to be that LGBT identity is a highly desirable social status, a state of things both positive and negative. On the one hand, it demonstrates how far LGBT equality has come, but on the other, it diminishes and trivializes the experience of LGBT Americans.

Ultimately, for gay and transgender people, little has changed. For young women, however, queer identity may just be the newest fashion trend they are eager to show off on social media.

Huge Increase In LGBT Identification Casts Doubt On 'Born This Way',"According to its latest polling data, the Gallup organization reports 5.6 percent of U.S. adults are now “identifying as LGBT,” adding, “The current estimate is up from 4.5 percent in Gallup’s previous update based on 2017 data.” This number was only 3.5 percent in 2012.

Are a higher percentage of people gay than in years past? Given the growing political and moral significance of this topic in our culture, it’s essential all Americans ask what data like this truly means.

To begin, it is essential to understand “being LGBT” isn’t the thing most people assume it is. Being LGBT is not a clinical sexual attraction, nor is it a medical or scientific term. No one is simultaneously a lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender person (much less all of the other letters that seem to be added every year).

This designation is merely a socio-political mash-up — a broad and imprecise term of political or ideological identity. This is demonstrated in the very fact that Gallup employed the term “LGBT” in its investigation, rather than any of the ever-evolving longer strings of letters like “LGBTQ,” “LGBTQQIAA,” or the clumsy catch-all “LGBTQ+”.

If “being LGBT” were really a thing, a meaningfully precise measure of what someone is, we could reasonably ask what Gallup’s percentage would have been if they offered respondents additional lettered options. Would their number have been larger if they asked how many were either “Q” or “queer and questioning” or included any of the other many letters?

None of the many news stories on the report bothered to ask this important question. This shows the general media lazily accepts “being LGBT” is simply shorthand for being “experimental.” This designation is therefore clearly not an objective, scientific thing, but merely a loose identity grouping rooted in politics and self-perception.

For this reason, the new data doesn’t truly tell us much other than that people are becoming more elastic in how they view their sexuality and gender. Unfortunately, this doesn’t reveal anything reliable about what people objectively are.

That’s because how people identify and what they actually do are often different. So research on how people behave sexually rather than just how they “identify” is well documented among scholars as famously complicated.

Gallup’s report backs up this fact, showing that young adults today are more than three times more likely to report “being LGBT” than even Gen Xers are. Gen Xers are certainly not so traditional that they would be reticent to admit any alternative sexual practices to pollsters or their peers. It is simply becoming increasingly fashionable to be seen as sexually experimental today, evidenced in the fact that 55 percent of those who told Gallup they were “LGBT” said they were bisexual. Most of those are coupled with opposite-sex partners when they do have a romantic partner.

Queer advocates and their media partisans regularly tell us that “being LGBT” is a normal, natural thing. But the data is beyond dispute that young people are far more likely to identify as being LGBT than are all other age groups. Also, that identity is often at odds with their actual sexual behavior, as evidenced by the fact that women who openly identify as lesbian tend to have stunningly high unwanted pregnancy and abortion rates.

We have been carefully and secularly catechized to believe that being “gay,” “lesbian,” or “transgender” is an actual biological thing. But as catchy as it might be, Lady Gaga’s pop song “Born This Way” isn’t science. Even the American Psychological Association still admits no one is quite sure how or why people come to identify as any of the letters in the LGBT alphabet soup:

There is no consensus among scientists about the exact reasons that an individual develops a heterosexual, bisexual, gay or lesbian orientation. Although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor or factors.

What’s more, leftist scholars in the field of gender studies have increasingly been questioning if sexual orientation really is what our current cultural script says it is. Few journalists are aware of this fact.

Based on how the political and practical ideology of gender studies is shifting, other scholars hold that the concept of sexual orientation should be retired in favor of something called “sexual configuration theory.” That’s because, as one scholar holds, “sexual orientation as a term is increasingly seen as regressive.”

Why? Because it “belongs to the bioessentialist project” that doesn’t provide a chance for someone to “become” or “experience” something “other,” new, or emerging with equal legitimacy. Apparently, the idea that sexual orientation is “set” is so 2015.

Scholarship out of Cornell University explains the majority of people who identify as LGBT can simply be described as either “mostly straight” or “mostly gay” rather than fully one way or the other. The whole game is shifting right under our feet, while gender theorists reconceptualize what sexual orientation is, finding it’s quite different than what most leftists assume.

So, when you hear in the news “1 in 6 Gen Z adults are LGBT” like we did in the Washington Post — or as USA Today announced in a headline, “Society is Changing” — the wise and informed person must receive this information with the essential question of “What does it actually mean to be ‘LGBT?’” Tellingly, even the supposed “LGBT community” itself isn’t clear on the answer to this seemingly simple question.

So it really shouldn’t be news to anyone that an inherently imprecise political and ideological identity is growing in popularity with young people searching for purpose and identity.

Christians Who Think Gay Adoption Isn't Ideal Should Start Adopting Kids,"Bethany Christian Services, the nation’s largest Protestant adoption agency, made headlines this week when they began serving LGBTQ adults after years of rebuffing government pressure to place children with same-sex couples. To see which way the evangelical winds were blowing, Bethany commissioned the Barna Group to survey Christians on the question of LGBTQ adoptions. The report found 55 percent of Christians expressed some level of support for same-sex adoption.

Unfortunately, Bethany is looking to the wrong demographic to determine its placement policy. Criteria for adoptive parents should not be based on public opinion, not even Christian public opinion. Frankly, the demographic that should determine an agency’s placement policy isn’t adults at all, it’s the children in need of adoptive parents.

Who Is Adoption For?

Like so many other “marriage and family” issues, our culture gets questions about adoption exactly backward. Some states have forced Christian agencies to serve gays and lesbians, citing federal anti-discrimination laws. Op-eds have accused agencies that refuse to place children with same-sex couples of “resisting” LGBTQ rights. When we examine marriage and family issues from the adult’s perspective, we often arrive at the wrong answers, and that’s especially true in the adoption debate.

The reality is adoption isn’t about adults — it’s about the children. Thus answer to the question “Do gay people have a right to adopt?” is a hard “No.” Similarly, the answer to the question “Does a Christian married husband and wife have a right to adopt?” is also “No.”

No adult has a right to a child who is not biologically related. Thus, no adult has an inherent right to adopt. Rather, children who have lost their parents through tragedy have a right to be adopted.

When adoption is properly understood — as a just society’s response to children who have lost their parents, either to death or abandonment — it’s clear the child is the client, not the adults. Adoption is a critical institution that serves children in need. Whenever possible, children need a married mother and father.

Men and women are gloriously different, and those differences are most prominently displayed in the home. Yes, contrary to what you’ve heard, sex is not a social construct. In fact, so different are the ways that men and women interact with their children, many experts now believe there’s no such thing as “parenting” per se — there’s only mothering and fathering, and kids need both.

As an adoptive mom myself, I see that firsthand. All of our children — especially our adopted son — desperately need the distinct and complementary ways that my husband and I talk to, encourage, discipline, and interact with each of our children. My friend Samantha describes being raised by her dad and his boyfriend:

My formative years were almost entirely devoid of women. I didn’t even know that there was such a thing as a mother until I watched ‘The Land Before Time’ at school. My 5-year-old brain could not understand why I didn’t have the mom that I suddenly desperately wanted. I felt the loss. I felt the hole. As I grew, I tried to fill that hole with aunts, my dads’ lesbian friends, and teachers. I remember asking my first-grade teacher if I could call her mom. I asked that question of any woman who showed me any amount of love and affection. It was instinctive. I craved a mother’s love even though I was well-loved by my two gay dads.

Kids long for and benefit from both maternal and paternal love. Any adoption agency that fails to prioritize mothers and fathers in child placements is catering not to the best interest of the children, but to social pressure, adult desires, or ideological lies and is thus abandoning their true clients: the children.

The Ideal Isn’t Always Possible

With apologies to my fellow culture warrior Matt Walsh, I disagree that “it should be illegal for adoption agencies to place a child in anything but a stable mother and father home.” I certainly wish every child would be placed with a mother and father. But unless you’re talking about the years-long wait for white, drug-free infants (many of whom would be better served if we supported the birth mother in parenting her own child), there’s a shortage of mothers and fathers seeking to adopt.

Whether it’s children languishing in overseas orphanages or the explosion of opioid-orphaned or abandoned children who are older, have special needs, and often come in sibling groups, sometimes the married mother-father ideal simply isn’t available.

While working as the assistant director at a Chinese adoption agency, I experienced this up close and personal. Friends of mine — a lesbian couple — were made aware of a child overseas whose age and special needs had deterred several prospective heterosexual parents. Thus, their agency placed this little girl with my two friends, the only adults willing to take on her hard case.

Knowing my adoption background and expecting a difficult trip, they asked me to accompany them as they met their daughter for the first time. I gladly joined them for those two challenging weeks as they adjusted to their daughter’s significant medical and emotional needs.

Would this sweet girl have been better off in a home where she could experience paternal love as well as maternal love? Without a doubt. But she also could have died in that orphanage if my friends had not brought her into their home and provided her the medical care she desperately needed.

Unfortunately, that’s the unvarnished and unpopular reality of adoption. Especially with difficult placements, social workers can’t always match the child with parents who fit the idyllic best situation: a kinship connection, male and female parents, a stable and loving marriage, financial readiness, and the ability to cope with the child’s specific medical or behavioral needs.

For those conservatives or Christians who think children should not be placed with single or same-sex foster or adoptive parents, your first order of business is to become a foster parent or adoptive parent yourself.

Christian Agencies Should Act Like It

We can acknowledge the reality that the ideal isn’t always available without abandoning that ideal: orphaned and abandoned kids deserve mothers and fathers. If anyone should be elevating that ideal, it’s a Christian placement agency that follows the Man who insisted that sex is critical to your family of origin as well as to the family you create.

If 2020 census data stating same-sex couples are four times more likely than heterosexual couples to adopt is to be believed, plenty of agencies are already serving LGBTQ adults. There’s no need for Christian agencies to compromise on the child-centric reality that moms and dads matter, regardless of whether the state threatens to withhold aid and despite accusations of discrimination. Why? Because this sort of discrimination is precisely what sets adoption apart from the marketplace of reproductive tech.

When adoption is done right, every child will be placed with loving parents, but not every adult who wants a child will get one. All prospective parents’ background checks, screenings, references, and home studies exist specifically to discriminate against adults who have no business parenting an unrelated child.

Ultimately, Christian adoption agencies should be the most discriminating of them all. Indeed, it’s Christian adoption agencies who bear the greatest responsibility to elevate the importance of marriage and sex in parenting — especially when state-run agencies fail or refuse to do so.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/03/04/christians-who-think-gay-adoption-isnt-ideal-should-start-adopting-kids-themselves/,2021-03-04
Elliot Page’s Rapid Transformation Looks Like An Alarming Cry For Help,"Rather than advocate for taking time to fully understand who you want to be or addressing the long and careful journey most transgender people undergo, Elliot Page appears to be the model for rapid-onset gender dysphoria with almost instantaneous positive media reactions after transitioning within a few short weeks.

On Dec. 1, 2020, Ellen Page, star of “The Umbrella Academy,” declared herself “Elliot” Page. Nine weeks later, the announcement came that Page would be divorcing wife Emma Portner after three years.

Then, seven weeks later, on Mar. 16, 2021, Page graced the cover of Time magazine announcing the success of a top surgery — an elective double mastectomy — and declaring of the procedure, “It has completely transformed my life.” While much of this may have been ongoing in the background, at least to the public view this has been a rapid and dramatic change.

Several other things make this turn of events troubling. An adolescent or teenage girl struggling with gender dysphoria or simply not conforming to typical feminine stereotypes will look to Page and believe she only needs to announce to the world her new identity and in a moment’s time all of her anxieties, insecurities, and problems will vanish. She’ll be able to step out into the world as her new, “true” self.

Very few people, however, are willing to provide the genuine, hard, truth of this journey, its real-world consequences, or even of the likelihood of changing one’s mind later.

Page told Time that back in December she predicted “a lot of support and love and a massive amount of hatred and transphobia.” While the article positioned concerns about transgender body mutilation as hateful “vitriol” and stereotypical ignorance, Page was widely celebrated. As GLAAD took the opportunity to point out — along with the article and most reporting on the issue — Page is being positioned as a reluctant hero fighting against rightwing hatred and ignorance.

Just as the current legal battles over medical intervention for gender dysphoria in children and minors and protecting girls’ sports have nothing to do with bigotry towards transgender people, concerns about the rapid change from Ellen to Elliot is not an attack on the Page as an individual at all. Indeed, when Ellen announced she was now “he” and would be going by “Elliot,” within hours, every mainstream reference to the actor changed: suddenly the young girl who starred in “Juno” was labeled a young man named Elliot.

Huffington Post editorial director Noah Michelson celebrated:

So many people say and think so many awful things about trans people because they don’t know any trans people, so they know nothing about what it means to be trans. The more people like @TheElliotPage can tell their stories and the more we listen, the better things will become.

GLAAD, an LGBT advocacy organization, also championed the announcement saying:

Not only is Elliot Page a fine actor, he is also an advocate for equality and justice who continues to educate the world about who trans people really are and about why the current barrage of anti-trans bills promoted by fearmongering politicians are so harmful and unnecessary.

Yet many were astonished and concerned with how instantaneously the corporate media world reacted to affirm Page’s new identity, without question or hesitation. Many also wondered about Page’s thought process in making the decision.

Page had come out as gay in 2014. She said, “I am tired of hiding and I am tired of lying by omission,” declaring, “I suffered for years because I was scared to be out. My spirit suffered, my mental health suffered, and my relationships suffered. And I’m standing here today, with all of you, on the other side of all that pain.”

At the time she joked about how tabloid magazines loved to point out her masculine style, which she dismissed by saying she just preferred to be comfortable. She argued gender stereotypes “serve no one,” adding, “There are pervasive stereotypes about masculinity and femininity that define how we’re all supposed to act, dress and speak.”

After announcing her breast amputation, Page argued, “People cling to these firm ideas [about gender] because it makes people feel safe. But if we could just celebrate all the wonderful complexities of people, the world would be such a better place.” But Page’s actions tell a story of drastic changes of personality, identity, and plastic surgery to conform to a specific gender and sex norm.

So for many, seeing Page posing like an awkward teenage boy, fully embracing strict gender stereotypes, seems like a sudden and odd change. Page told Time, however, that she knew she was trans at age nine when she was allowed to cut her hair, explaining, “I felt like a boy … I wanted to be a boy. I would ask my mom if I could be someday.”

Page’s personal journey is not really in question or a concern. As an adult, you are free to make big changes and redefine yourself as you please. If medically changing one’s body and adopting a new identity is what brings Page happiness, then there is really nothing to discuss. If so, I and many others are happy for Page.

There is a legitimate concern, however, about the overall messaging of her transition and how LGBT media and left-wing activists exploit this general tolerance to bully for more aggressive and extreme politics. Page now says this has been a lifelong challenge of differing degrees. Formerly identifying as a lesbian, now Page identifies to Time as nonbinary and queer, with an identity that is an “ongoing process.”

But the rest of us saw a successful, happily married lesbian icon unexpectedly announce she is transgender, quickly file for divorce, and undergo top surgery shortly after. For the audience of young people Page claims to want to help, the entire transition happened in the blink of an eye.

It’s not as simple as picking out a new style of clothing and a nickname. It’s more than cutting your hair short. Medical intervention has permanent and life-altering implications that must be carefully understood by an adult mind capable of consenting to the risks involved.

The belief that personal fulfillment and happiness can only be achieved by hiding sex-specific characteristics and adopting the stereotypes of the opposite sex is deeply disturbing. Presenting all of this to kids as though it’s as simple as Page made it appear is downright dangerous.

"WaPo Writer Makes False Claim About Ryan Anderson, Won't Correct","Michelle Boorstein made a simple mistake. Boorstein, a religion reporter for the Jeff Bezos-backed Washington Post, tweeted, “Some religious objectors to the Equality Act say the issue isn’t exemptions — it’s that LGBT equality is akin to ‘what gave us the Holocaust,’ a concept that humans are trying to overrule God.”

She was partially quoting from a lecture Ryan Anderson gave in 2016. Boorstein’s attempt to paraphrase Anderson conveyed a verifiably false representation of his position on the legislation, which she has since refused to correct. Meanwhile Amazon, another powerful business owned by Bezos, outright refuses to sell Anderson’s popular book on transgenderism.

Called out on her false reporting, Boorstein engaged in a lengthy back-and-forth with critics—including Anderson—but refused to concede any misrepresentation of the quote. “Listen to his lecture,” she tweeted. “His perspective is plain: He thinks there is a distortion in the understanding of humanity that gave us the Holocaust and gay marriage and transgenderism; he is straightforward. There is no intent to misrepresent, nor a misrepresentation.”

What Anderson did not do, however, is say or even imply his objection to the Equality Act is based on the idea “that LGBT equality is akin to ‘what gave us the Holocaust,’ a concept that humans are trying to overrule God.” But that’s what Boorstein explicitly claimed he believes. (Note also that she frames the issue as “LGBT equality,” revealing a deeper bias we take for granted at this point.)

Anderson, president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center and author of “When Harry Became Sally,” interpreted Boorstein’s jab as retaliation for his criticism of her recent story on the Equality Act. “Why would a reporter manufacture such an inflammatory and offensive quote—and refuse to correct the record even after being contacted—unless damaging my professional reputation is part of the goal,” he tweeted on Wednesday.

The quote in question came from a 2016 lecture Anderson delivered at the Wheatley Institution. He was building off remarks from Pope John Paul II that argued mass tragedies of the 20th Century stemmed from, as Anderson described, “a bad understanding of the human person.”

“He said that as we’ve eclipsed God, we’ve denigrated man,” Anderson noted, listing the Holocaust among the 20th century’s large-scale atrocities connected to this change. He went on to argue (very compellingly) that “denigration of man” is also behind the rise of “abortion on demand, and embryo-destructive research, and the redefinition of marriage, and the rise of transgender ideology.”

Boorstein, however, quoted a tweet referencing that statement and said, “Some religious objectors to the Equality Act say the issue isn’t exemptions — it’s that LGBT equality is akin to ‘what gave us the Holocaust,’ a concept that humans are trying to overrule God.” Anderson’s point in 2016 had absolutely nothing to do with the Equality Act nor did he make the claim that “the issue isn’t exemptions.”

That is entirely Boorstein’s personal extrapolation, framed falsely as fact. It’s a misrepresentation of Anderson’s views, which is a disservice not only to him but to Boorstein’s readers, who deserve accurate information from those who purport to provide it.

Her false claim, it must be noted, comes just after the Post was forced to correct a horribly botched story that used anonymous sourcing to attribute an inflammatory quote to Donald Trump, which was cited in his impeachment trial, after audio emerged contradicting the article.

What’s interesting and disturbing is that the Post and Amazon have both smeared Anderson on the basis of the same false claim, that “When Harry Became Sally” characterizes “LGBTQ+ identity as a mental illness.”

“My book made no such claim,” Anderson wrote in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. “I contacted the Post asking them to quote a single sentence from the book supporting their contention that I had called transgender people mentally ill. They couldn’t, because it doesn’t exist. Within a day, the newspaper had entirely rewritten the story, removing the falsehoods and changing the headline.”

Two powerful entities backed by the same billionaire are using their own biased and misleading interpretations to smear and quiet the reach of one of the most prominent writers on a hugely important topic. It’s creepy, and should rankle the journalists employed at Bezos’s paper. Instead, they’re happy to participate in the pile-on because it comports with their cultural worldview.

LGBT Activists Haul Jack Phillips Into Court Again Over Trans Cake,"Hearings began Monday in a new case against the Masterpiece Cake Shop located in suburban Denver over a transgender male suing for the owner’s refusal to celebrate his transition.

Jack Phillips, a devout Christian who runs the cake shop in Lakewood, Colorado, is a defendant in court again this week after fending off discrimination charges in a more than half-decade-long legal battle that reached the U.S. Supreme Court when, based on his faith, he denied to bake a custom wedding cake for two gay men in 2012 but offered other items.

“I don’t make cakes for same-sex weddings, but I’ll sell you anything else in my shop, cookies, brownies,” Phillips told the couple, who, out of all the bakeries in the area, sought out the baker who would deny them the very specific service that compromised his faith.

The couple, David Mullins and Charlie Craig, filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission arguing Phillips violated the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act (CADA) which prohibits any business that offers services to the public from discrimination based on race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation.

The controversy went national, provoking harassment campaigns and death threats against the suburban baker that ultimately cost him 40 percent of his income when Phillips stopped baking cakes following a lower court’s decision against the shop. The case inspired another against Phillips after the Supreme Court announced in 2017 it would re-examine the lower court’s ruling, which it ultimately overturned on narrow grounds.

Autumn Scardina, a transgender female-identifying attorney in the Denver area, called Phillips to demand a custom cake celebrating his gender transition after he heard the Supreme Court would consider the initial case against the Colorado Civil Rights Commission. Twice, Scardina had already emailed Phillips to call the baker a “bigot” and a “hypocrite” while mocking his religious beliefs in 2012 when the controversy first arose.

A 2012 email presented as evidence in court also show Scardina offered to be a plaintiff in a discriminatory case against the cakeshop in the gay couple’s absence if they chose not to move forward with litigation.

The cake shop denied Scardina’s 2017 request for a pink and blue cake after he said it was to celebrate his gender transition. Scardina responded with a new complaint picked up by the Colorado Civil Rights Commission that was dismissed in 2019 by the group after Phillips filed a lawsuit against the state in federal court. Months later, Scardina chose to pursue charges of his own seeking damages, fines, and attorney fees to wreck Phillip’s finances rather than appeal the commission’s decision to drop the discrimination claim.

Represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, a legal non-profit dedicated to First Amendment cases, which also took the Masterpiece Cake Shop case to the Supreme Court in 2017, the defense has argued Phillip’s cakes constitute artistic creations of expression. Scardina’s demands for a cake celebrating his gender transition would violate Phillips’s First Amendment rights through government coercion.

In court, Scardina explained how at one point, while his discrimination claim was being processed by the state, he called the Christian cakeshop to request a custom cake that featured Satan smoking a joint, to test the store’s repeated claims he would be treated just as anyone else.

“They indicated that I was welcome back in their shop and entitled to the same treatment as every other customer that telephones or comes through its doors,” Scardina said. “I had filed the charge, I think, sometime in July. It’s now sometime in late fall. Nothing had been done as far as I was aware, and once again here they are saying ‘Sure, she’s [sic] welcome back, and come on in, and we’ll treat you just like everybody else.'”

Scardina continued.

I found it sort of offensive and wanted to see if that’s true too. So I called and spoke with who I believed to be Mr. Phillips. He answered the phone this time. I think I indicated — I asked: ‘Do you serve religious cakes?’ Because I noted in his several examples, they had nothing regarding religious cakes. Mr. Phillips indicated that he did. I asked him, ‘Well, could you prepare a religious cake for me that had’ — I think a picture of Satan smoking a joint is the religious cake I asked for.

Pursuant to his religious faith, Phillips also refuses to bake cakes in celebration of Halloween.

“I don’t create cakes for Halloween, I wouldn’t create a cake that would be anti-American or disparaging against anybody for any reason, even cakes that would disparage people who identify as LGBT,” Phillips said on NBC’s “Today” show in 2018 on his first major case in the Supreme Court over his objection to baking a gay wedding cake. “Cakes have a message and this one I can’t create.”

Kristi Noem Running Mike Pence Play To Help Leftists Control The Culture,"South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem has rightly made a national name for herself courageously standing, almost alone, for science, sanity, and constitutional rights during the COVID panic. Yet it appears she’s hoping to use the goodwill she earned through this courage to hide her cowardly and deceptive choices about transgender politics.

Like the governors who should have learned from her example on lockdowns and have instead doubled down on their leadership failures, Noem could decide to come clean, change course, and pursue common-sense policies about sex. Or she could continue to eviscerate her credibility and earned goodwill by selling out her own constituents on behalf of sexually debauched corporatists, as Mike Pence did when governor of Indiana.

Rolling over to leftists in the culture war is certainly what voters have come to expect from politicians with an R after their names not named Donald Trump. But it also would be what Trump taught voters we don’t have to put up with anymore. Any standard-bearer of today’s right must fight the culture war, not hide from it. Unless reversed, her capitulation has disqualified Noem from national leadership.

Based on her tweets, a Monday press conference, and media appearances, Noem appears to be insisting people believe she’s acting to “protect girls’ sports” while actually abdicating her power to do so. She appears to be expecting that the people listening are so easily fooled that she can say what she knows they want to hear while doing what undermines what they want done. Let’s look at her arguments and the context to see this is clearly the case.

Expecting People to Believe Plainly False Assertions

As Margot Cleveland detailed in these pages Monday, the South Dakota legislature sent Noem a bill that would have forbidden males from playing in female sports from kindergarten through college in South Dakota, including mechanisms for verifying student-athletes’ biological sex and allowing for legal redress against anyone who broke this would-be law.

Noem sent the bill back to the legislature, demanding significant changes in a veto message. Her desired changes would allow men to compete in women’s sports at the college level — and potentially K-12, based on birth certificate rules — and eliminate penalties for violating it. Essentially, Noem’s changes would make the law toothless.

In attempting to defend her actions to Tucker Carlson, Noem made false and misleading claims. At least three times in the Carlson interview alone, Noem tried to blame the NCAA for her refusal to sign a bill to protect women’s sports. Here’s one:

The entire point of this bill is to help women have legal recourse against being forced to compete against men. Noem says she's TERRIFIED to allow legal fights (?) much less spend time on them, and instead offers, and I'm not joking, a petition governors can sign. YIKES. https://t.co/cbEJMBoVYt — Mollie (@MZHemingway) March 23, 2021

Here’s number two: “This bill would only allow the NCAA to bully South Dakota, and it would actually prevent women from being able to participate in collegiate sports.”

Third, she also said: “It would put a law on the books that would allow the NCAA to take punitive action against our state. And we’re a small state, Tucker. We’ve had to fight hard to get any tournaments to come to South Dakota. When they took punitive action against us, we would have to litigate, and legal scholars that I have been consulting with for many, many months say that I would very likely lose those litigation efforts.”

It is deliberately misleading to assert the NCAA would retaliate for this bill’s passage when states including Idaho and Mississippi have passed similar laws and their college women still play NCAA sports. As Cleveland explains, Noem is attempting to make the public believe that the NCAA requires participating sports teams to allow transgender athletes, when this is false.

Nothing in NCAA policy is an obstacle to this bill, despite Noem’s attempts to portray otherwise. If the NCAA threatened her with legal action, she should show the receipts, and NCAA should be pressed to account for why they threatened South Dakota but not Idaho or Mississippi with legal action — not mean press releases, legal action.

Who Are These ‘Legal Scholars,’ Anyway?

Noem repeatedly claimed she was scared of lawsuits brought by the NCAA, parents of daughters forced to compete against transgender boys, and unnamed others over this bill. She attributed this alleged fear to claims from “legal scholars.” Did she consider competing legal opinions, or is this another misdirection? Because other legal experts are publicly disputing Noem’s claims of a lawsuit bonanza and offering free legal aid against such a specter.

By “legal scholars,” does Noem mean her chief of staff, Tony Venhuizen, a lawyer who also sits on the board of the Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce, which listed H.B. 1217 as a “tier 1” priority “of the highest importance” to oppose this legislative session? Or perhaps she means her “top advisor,” Matt McCaulley, a lawyer and lobbyist whose “clients include Sanford Health, which owns Sanford Sports Complex, a Sioux Falls arena that hopes to lure NCAA tourneys”?

Sanford Health also performs transgender treatments on minors, according to testimony before the South Dakota legislature in 2020. It therefore opposed a bill to ban transgender child mutilation last year, testifying and lobbying against it. Its lobbyist, McCaulley, is also getting hundreds of thousands of dollars to advise Noem, in an obvious conflict of interest state lawmakers have voiced concerns about.

“McCaulley is also the managing partner of Redstone Law Firm in Sioux Falls, which has been hired to provide outside legal counsel to the Noem administration,” noted in-state outlet Capital Journal shortly before Noem reversed her position on this bill.

Venhuizen is a former partner in McCaulley’s firm who left to work for Noem. Are these the legal advisors she’s talking about?

Even if NCAA is more than one of Noem’s intended fall guys for her refusal to sign this bill, the NCAA is not elected to control South Dakota laws. Noem and the state legislature are. South Dakotans don’t elect Kristi Noem to tell them she can’t sign laws their representatives want because some unelected leaders of private sports and business organizations insist their state indulge sexual insanity.

Culture War Capitulation Disqualifies Right Leaders

To Carlson, Noem also alleged, “The bill my legislature gave me is a trial lawyer’s dream. It creates more and more litigation and regulation that’s impossible to comply with for families and school districts and for people going forward.” Cleveland and the Alliance Defending Freedom, a religious liberty legal nonprofit, both say that is clearly false. The notification requirements of the bill are within the normal disclosures parents sign for students already.

A few minutes later, Noem wildly claimed of the bill:

If a child doesn’t make a team they up to a year later can come back and sue every member of that team and the K-12 system and the entire school district as well, and continue suing, so that they have an opportunity to play. If we put the collegiate athletics on there, then we will get punitively challenged by the NCAA and then we’ll have to continue to fight them, and a court district that is not friendly to winning. That’s what the legal scholars have told me for many, many months, that my chances of winning in court are very very low.

It is apparent that Noem is getting and spreading bad information about the potential consequences of this bill. In addition, this recent explanation contrasts curiously with her previous public statements.

If “legal scholars” have told her these terrible things about the bill’s consequences “for many, many months,” why did she pledge to sign just two weeks ago? She didn’t find these kinds of claims persuasive for “many, many months,” but now suddenly does? Why?

Noem Has a History of Pro-Trans Policy

It seems pertinent to note that Noem has not been a reliable ally of vulnerable women threatened by transgender politics. On July 13, 2020, the Noem administration okayed placing male prisoners in women’s prisons if the male claimed to be female. Signed by Noem’s secretary of corrections, a state cabinet member, the policy states:

“Inmate housing is not based exclusively on external genital anatomy of those housed in the unit or facility.”

“Requests by a transgender, intersex or gender dysphoric inmate to transfer to a facility inconsistent with the inmate’s external genital anatomy (sex), may be considered.”

“Inmates may contact unit staff to request to be addressed with gender-neutral forms of direction by staff (e.g. ‘Inmate Smith’ or ‘Smith’) or ‘he’ ‘she’ ‘him’ ‘her’, consistent with their identified gender.”

The basis for housing a male prisoner with female prisoners, the document states, could be solely the male’s “strong desire.”

The policy also allows male prisoners to demand to be physically searched — including genital “patting” — by a female prison guard: “Transgender, intersex and gender dysphoric inmates may contact the unit manager to request staff who are the same gender as the inmate conduct pat searches of the inmate. The inmate’s preference for same-gender staff will be accommodated whenever reasonably possible. Female staff may pat search male or female gender inmates.”

That’s bad enough, but there’s more. As Jon Schweppe of the American Principles Project notes of the 2020 attempt to ban transgender child mutilation in South Dakota, Noem kept quiet on the bill publicly but did “tell one media outlet that she had ‘concerns.’ (Sources within the state have told my organization that she effectively killed it.)”

State Rep. Fred Deutsch said of this bill, “The bill had strong support in the House with a 46-23 majority, but the behind the scene’s [sic] effort by Gov. Noem to kill the bill combined with Senate capitulation put the final nail in the coffin.”

So possibly more honest things came out of Noem’s mouth when she told Carlson, “I’m not interested in picking a fight” and “I’m not even going to let conservatives on the right bully me.” Her course of action will clearly end in denying protection to vulnerable girls while giving Noem the ability to shift the blame for it from herself to the state legislature.

Noem says if the legislature doesn’t pass her preferred version of this bill, she will call them into special session. But the legislature already passed the version of the bill they want, and if Noem had objections, like every other governor she could have made them known during the normal bill process. That is how passing a bill works — when governors actually want a bill they’re willing to sign.

She tweeted her promise to sign the bill with these provisions in it before it passed. A friendly Gov works with the Leg. to raise concerns before a bill passes. Then the Leg. can make changes. She said nothing. She could have easily cured the supposed technical problems. 2/4 — Kristen Waggoner (@KWaggonerADF) March 20, 2021

Instead, all this political theater with the celebrities at a press conference for the “coalition” she’s started are all aimed at making Noem look like a champion for “girls’ sports” while she effectively does nothing to protect girls or sports. She wants credit for talking big and signing no effective bills. She shouldn’t get it.

The Mike Pence Rule: Smile While You Sell Them Out

This would only be a better orchestrated political con than the one Pence pulled off as the first Republican governor to bend over and cry for his mommy when the LGBT left decided Indiana was the place they would start openly using private companies as political assault weapons.

In 2015, Indiana’s lawmakers accidentally became the test case for a new leftist political strategy. When big business threatened the Republican-run state if they did what their constituents wanted by passing mild protections for religious people sued by LGBT activists, the legislature, led by Pence, capitulated so far that they made Indiana “the most hostile state in the country to the conscience rights the original law was designed to protect.”

Ever since, Pence has gone around ridiculously proclaiming himself a “religious liberty” champion, when the truth is the opposite: Hoosiers had stronger religious freedom before he took office. Just like Noem, Pence told his legislature to “fix” the original religious freedom bill that made lefties who don’t vote for them angry, and his “fix” ended up being a corporate-designed crap sandwich. It was a complete lie designed to let them save face and go on TV proclaiming to still stand for principles and voters they had just shivved in the back over 30 pieces of corporate silver.

After his capitulation, Republican governor after governor after governor crumpled like doggie waste bags as LGBT activists accelerated what they had learned from his cowardice was a spectacularly successful tactic. It’s no stretch to say that if Pence had not been so weak, today’s oppressive cancel culture would not be what it is. It’s clear that refusing to bow to the mob is the most effective way to defeat them.

Noem shouldn’t be proposing fake “fixes” to this girls’ sports legislation, she should be calling a special session to demand that South Dakota immediately ban cutting off children’s breasts and penises and sterilizing them for life. That’s a human rights violation of monstrous proportions, and her own advisor works for people who profit from doing it. If she doesn’t, we’ll all know it’s because she’s something other than a “champion of girls” who “won’t be bullied.”

Bethany Decided To Feed Foster Children To The Leftist Mob,"On March 1, Bethany Christian Services sent shock waves through the adoption and foster care community with its landmark decision to place children with same-sex parents. There staring out from the pages of The New York Times stood the imposing figure of Chris Palusky, president of this historic Christian agency rooted in the Dutch Reformed world of Grand Rapids, Michigan.

The news of surrender hit hard. Bethany, the ten-ton gorilla of adoption and foster care, and the place Christians usually turn to first, caved to the pressure of the LGBT lobby.

Of course, everyone knew Bethany had been hit with lawsuits in Philadelphia and Michigan. But Bethany was not alone in the fight to allow Christian relief agencies, including adoption and foster care, to offer care for the vulnerable while also following dictates of their religious convictions. Bethany was but the largest, and most visible, Protestant group.

Everyone’s eyes have been focused on the upcoming June ruling by the Supreme Court, Fulton vs. the City of Philadelphia. Will Catholic Social Services, a vanguard of care in Philadelphia, be able to continue placing children as they always have, in father-mother families? Or will religious convictions be labeled “discrimination” and ministries like theirs cut off at the knees?

Catholic Social Services already helps same-sex couples find placements through 29 other nearby agencies. Like Bethany in the past, they simply request to operate their own ministry according to their conscience. That Bethany has capitulated even before this major verdict was rendered weakens everyone.

Faith-based agencies have counted on Bethany to stand strong. They know that if the Supreme Court decides against Catholic Social Services in June, many of the 8,000 faith-affirming providers and families they serve will be forced out of business.

Can This Be Called Compassion?

Bethany has succumbed to pressure from the left to redefine marriage and parenting. Gone from their website is any reference to the long-accepted binary of male and female. In its place is the all-inclusive, sanitized word “family.”

Bethany frames their historic pivot as “compassion.” Palusky, the organization’s president and CEO, says Bethany now wants “to offer services with the love and compassion of Jesus to the many types of families who exist in our world today.”

Implied, somehow, is that same-sex families are being excluded from the privilege of adoption and foster care. That’s not the case. Same-sex couples have always fostered or adopted children through any of myriad state and secular agencies.

The driving force for Bethany has been the threat of losing federal funding. If religious freedom becomes a second-class right, the federal tax dollars large adoption and foster care agencies like Bethany rely on will go away. Bethany read the handwriting on the wall. The bullseye of their surrender is the fear of losing federal monies.

The goal, which easily gets lost in this discussion, is to get as many children into safe and stable homes as possible. The opioid epidemic has produced a huge spike in the number of children needing care.

In the previous administration, the tension between faith-based agencies and secular ones was resolved by a determination to keep everyone at the table, every agency involved. Amy Stephens, a senior advisor for the Administration of Children and Families until 2021, says that “to undermine faith-based agencies by accusing them of “discrimination” for following biblically held beliefs “ultimately hurts foster children and keeps them in an already terrible place.”

This approach of keeping every agency fully onboard produced the first decline in history of “waiting children” who were eligible for adoption. More children found families.

Bethany’s surrender to the aggressive tactics of LGBT activists is a great blow to the effort to care for the country’s most vulnerable children. They become pawns in a social engineering experiment about what constitutes “family” and “parenting.” The demand to mainstream same-sex parenting comes at their expense. If the left cares about children, the worst possible approach is to politicize their placement. This isn’t compassion. It’s a cause for mourning.

Children Will Pay The Price

One great irony here is that Bethany has had the privilege of riding the wave of increased commitment to foster care and adoption among Christian churches for a decade. Saddleback Community Church in California began the trend. It was the first megachurch to make foster care an all-out goal. If church families opened their homes, county welfare agencies could throw away their lists. Other churches followed suit.

Rooted in the first-century biblical admonition to “care for widows and orphans in their distress,” this renewed call to help vulnerable children rings out from many pulpits now. Indeed, the response has been so great that groups like Promise 686 in Atlanta focus entirely on helping churches build “family advocacy ministries” to care for families who foster and adopt.

Promise expected to serve only churches in Georgia. Within three years, though, so many groups sought their help that they now have 33 affiliates in more than 20 states. Ty Bryant, Promise’s vice president, warns that a deluge of needy children is coming, as the pandemic has forced many into lockdown situations in poor placements. The abuse reports are the highest on record. The country can hardly afford to lose agencies and families willing to foster and adopt.

These families have relied on Bethany to have their backs and to stand by Christian principles. Motivated Christian couples have been Bethany’s bread-and-butter supporters. They are the constituency who feels most betrayed.

Darcy Olsen, who directs a major foster care reform effort in Arizona called Generation Justice, says that “without Christians providing foster care, the number of people fostering in this country would drop by half.” She advocates, as many do, that the state should let groups “come as they are.” We need everyone on board.

Capitulation Never Goes Well

Bethany’s surrender will empower the left in its grand march to coerce compliance around its moral code. A fake-unity of sorts is achieved. But it’s the kind that comes from treating partners as enemies if they think differently, then running them out of business.

There’s a high cost to this approach. Those “small platoons” of care and generosity that have marked western societies for centuries will slowly disappear. What will replace them? Only the work of a cumbersome, impersonal nanny-state that regulates every move from a thousand miles away.

If Christian organizations are undermined in the care of children, everyone will lose. Tragically, children will lose the most. The longer a child languishes in the system, packing his little bag for the next foster care placement, the greater his chance of never finding a lasting home. A full 60 percent of teenagers who end up being trafficked for sex were former foster care children. It’s a sin to increase the vulnerability of already vulnerable children.

When the state chooses to undermine faith-based organizations, and when a group like Bethany abandons any meaningful adherence to the word “Christian,” more children end up receiving less care. That’s the actual bottom line.

Bethany may renew their federal contracts. But in the bigger picture, more abandoned children will run the streets.

GLAAD: You’re A Bigot If You Don’t Eat Gay French Fries And Like It,"What makes a person anti-LGBT in 2021? Well, according to GLAAD, one of the oldest, most influential, and most prominent LGBT advocacy organizations in America, anything from simply commenting on McDonald’s introducing LGBT pride French fries to testifying before Congress on behalf of women and girls in sports is sufficient.

In the GLAAD Accountability Project, GLAAD maintains a list of more than 200 organizations, politicians, and individuals it believes demonstrate anti-LGBT bias. When I released my book, “Without Context: Evaluating the Anti-LGBT Claims Against the Trump Administration,” in 2020, I reviewed the GLAAD Accountability Project’s claims.

Unfortunately, the standards for inclusion on this list can range widely from supporting unquestionably anti-LGBT positions to remarkably petty and ridiculous accusations weighed down by significant political and ideological biases. For example, when they list President Trump endorsing Roy Moore in 2017, Moore’s history of legitimately anti-LGBT arguments form the basis for a reasonable evaluation. Yet when they cite President Trump’s 2017 Executive Order restricting Syrian refugees as an anti-LGBT policy because it could in theory affect LGBT refugees, clear bias and unreliable standards are afoot.

The real concern, however, is in GLAAD’s practice of targeting individuals in the public eye for these types of accusations, again refusing to distinguish between openly anti-LGBT advocates and political voices they simply disagree with. This was most recently illustrated by GLAAD adding center-left writer Jesse Singal to their list. Singal was marked for simply reporting the stories of transgender people who later regretted their transition and reporting on the research of physicians and other experts in the field.

Similarly, Abigail Shrier — author of the bestselling book “Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters” — was included on the list for referring to transgender girls as “biological boys” and referencing biological sex as a fact. GLAAD argues that in her testimony before U.S. Congress on the Equality Act, Shrier was “Falsely claiming women and girls are at risk if the LGBTQ civil rights legislation is passed.”

She also stands accused by the organization of “Falsely comparing being transgender to eating disorders, and falsely and baselessly claiming transition is akin to demonic possession and self-harm.”

As is common in these listings, GLAAD links to ideologically compatible activist sources like Media Matters as evidence. Yet in Shrier’s case, for example, she never compared being transgender to demonic possession.

In discussing the genuinely real concern of social contagion, she talked with Joe Rogan about issues for teenage girls, saying the majority of those going transgender currently are “the same population that gets involved in cutting, demonic possession, witchcraft, anorexia, bulimia.” This kind of important context and nuance is an ongoing problem with GLAAD’s reporting standards and evidence. They contort disagreement with leftist gender ideology into opposition to LGBT people, simply refusing to consider any opposing interpretations.

Unfortunately, the above two examples are not isolated. Describing the “worst anti-LGBT statements” from individuals who spoke at the 2017 Values Voter Summit, GLAAD includes Laura Ingraham for arguing medical transition in minors is “child abuse,” Dana Loesch for pointing out concerns regarding legally requiring schools to allow boys into girl’s bathrooms and locker rooms, and Kevin Sorbo for musing that Chick-fil-A has better fries after McDonald’s introduced rainbow-themed fries during LGBT Pride month.

Others included on their Accountability Project website are Ben Shapiro, Heritage Foundation President Kay Coles James, and Ryan T. Anderson, among many other conservative public figures. Mary Emily O’Hara, who works for GLAAD’s rapid response team, defended the list:

GLAAD has published similar lists for years as part of its media and policy monitoring mission. See: Trump Accountability Project, Commentator Accountability Project, and the Biden Equality Accountability Tracker that launched earlier this month.

Of course, GLAAD is perfectly within its rights to publish information illustrating its worldview and beliefs. The problem is that it positions itself as a universal LGBT advocacy group providing accurate information regarding public figures and their stated views on LGBT issues.

Yet, as Singal pointed out in a lengthy rebuttal correcting GLAAD’s easily disproven claims about him, the issue at hand is this: “Even more disturbing is GLAAD’s insistence that mere belief in gender dysphoria desistance constitutes a bigoted belief in 2021 — bigoted enough to get you put on a list.”

As I’ve demonstrated, failure to accurately report the actual words being referenced with a reliable citation is a major problem. They prefer to paraphrase to promote their ideological spin. Even left-wing LGBT activist Dan Savage has recognized the danger in this new Puritanism within powerful LGBT organizations. Unfortunately, this reckless approach to political shaming under the guise of activism is at the core of the problem.

After complaints that they published false information, GLAAD quietly took down all listings for their Accountability Project — aside from President Trump and Vice President Pence — during what they referred to as an “internal review process.” The organization insists none of the entries will be permanently removed and additional profiles will be added as they relaunch the project at a future date. This prompted Singal to ask the organization, “Can you tell us more about why your organization decided to publish this list before it had been vetted?”

The wider issue is that dozens of high-profile organizations partner with GLAAD, including Google, Facebook, Viacom, Coca-Cola, Disney, Sony, and others. Being included on a list identifying you as an “anti-LGBT activist” isn’t merely an online inconvenience, it could destroy a person’s career and reputation over what amounts to political disagreement.

This is, of course, the reason GLAAD organizes it in the first place: to shame and intimidate others from engaging in ideas and advocacy that could potentially get themselves labeled “anti-LGBT.” GLAAD has arbitrarily declared it’s the authority on what is and is not acceptable in polite society in LGBT debates, but rather than defend those positions, the organization is more than happy to simply duck the challenge, and put you on a public list as punishment for defying them.

How Activists Deliberately Amplified Transgenderism To America's Kids,"At 15, I cropped off my long hair. The result was exhilarating. Not long after, I rented a tuxedo for my high school dance, a first for a girl at my school. Excited yet apprehensive, I couldn’t wait to try it on. Any qualms I had were quickly swept aside by how much I enjoyed the feel of each suit piece and how it made me look.

I walked and carried myself differently. Wearing a tux and tails felt much more “me” than any of my awkward attempts at wearing a dress. I was secretly same-sex attracted, deeply confused about my identity, and more and more preferred a masculinized version of myself. I described myself as “androgynous” and papered over the pain I carried with a bravado of pride in being a “non-conformist.”

Fast forward 30-plus years to Time magazine’s cover story of Ellen Page’s transformation into Elliot, including top surgery, and my heart both resonates and breaks. Had my younger self been part of this generation, I could have easily gone from gender non-conformity to lost body parts, in search of an elusive self-transformation to escape the pain I was experiencing. Laying aside all else, even if the still beautiful Page finds improved happiness post-transition, the objective fact remains that most don’t.

Moreover, Page is making these decisions as a 34-year-old adult. Yet how many more people — most of them younger — will be influenced by the media’s unrelenting celebration of transgender identity? How many young women (and young men) going through the “hell of puberty,” as Page puts it, will look and find yet another famous herald for an alluring gender “journey” cure-all? In a single day after the transgender announcement, Page gained 400,000 Instagram followers.

Undoubtedly with good intentions, Page is speaking out to condemn bills meant to protect minors from these irreversible procedures. Yet the delayed transition in Page’s life preserved full fertility, bone density, and sexual function. As a famous actor, Page will get a cover story and a voice; Keira Bell, the brave detransitioned woman who won her lawsuit against a gender clinic for improper care of minors, will not.

A Generation Made, Not Begotten

How shall we describe this generation? First, they are a generation intentionally being made, and both social media and legacy media outlets are major players in the game — though certainly not the only ones, depending on the school district your child attends.

In May 2014, Time’s cover featured Laverne Cox and declared a “Transgender Tipping Point” (in her Time cover story, Page mentions Cox as an inspiration), which went on to win a media award from the LGBT advocacy group GLAAD. GLAAD has just republished its “accountability project” after admitting errors.

Less than three years later, in March 2017, everyday young people were featured in the cover story “Beyond He or She,” declaring that this generation was redefining gender and sexuality, pointing out that non-binary expressions are “increasingly moving from the margins to the mainstream.” The article noted Facebook having “about 60 options for users’s gender” to illustrate this trend. The bulk of the article goes on to give details of a GLAAD-commissioned study shared exclusively with Time.

GLAAD’s website includes a timeline of its accomplishments, including a meeting with Time seeking more LGBT coverage in 1999. There is also an entry for February 2014, highlighting “Facebook Gender Options: GLAAD works with Facebook to expand gender options, making the platform more inclusive of transgender and gender non-conforming users.” Thus, GLAAD specifically worked to multiply gender identity labels with Facebook and Time featured an article celebrating that Facebook “gender revolution” when it occurred.

Three years later, the Facebook expansion of the “gender lexicon” is cited as evidence this generation is “re-defining” gender and these identities are becoming more mainstream. This engineered social change, and subsequent reporting on it, deliberately drove yet more social change. As GLAAD’s motto reads: “Leading the conversation. Shaping the media narrative. Changing the culture. That’s GLAAD at work.” GLAAD has been hard at work indeed.

Thus, with 1.8 percent of Generation Z identifying as transgender and 1 in 6 self-identifying as under the LGBT banner, it should surprise no one the actor formerly known as Ellen Page now graces the cover of Time as a transman.

A Generation Unlike Us

We should indeed acknowledge how Generation Z is unique. Never before has a generation in the United States been raised so fatherless, born under more existential threat from abortion, had almost all forms of sexuality normalized and expressly promoted to them, and exposed to more explicit sexual imagery so young. This is the “iGen” — with smartphones that put porn at their fingertips and hook them to social media, like patients chained to a constant IV drip.

Crucially, no generation has ever had “the normalization of body dissociation” directly marketed to them for profit. Doctors use Instagram to market top surgery, and hormones are available essentially on demand. Similar to the ubiquitous commercials directing us to “ask our doctor about the purple pill,” the array of options for medicalized identity interventions are finding their target audience, primarily the young. The generation that tipped transgender has been, and is being given, a monumental and non-stop shove.

In all the discussions of coming to self-acceptance and celebrating self-determination, those who reject the material reality of male and female are inevitably at war with their own selves.

For those who choose to undergo any degree of medical alteration, even if they temporarily achieve the psychological results they desire, their bodies are objectively less healthy. The well-being of the mind pitted against the well-being of the body and mandating medical harm for mental wellness makes individuals houses divided against themselves.

Thus, in many tragic ways, Gen Z is a groundbreaking generation due in part to our sins. The whirlwind we now reap is filled with the fragmented identities of our sons and daughters who will acknowledge themselves to be neither.

For people of faith, let us begin with repentance: Acknowledging our own sins will enable us to respond to those of this generation. We will pray more effectively for the children of this age when we admit our own waywardness and contribution to theirs.

Amplify Voices of Reason

What else then shall we do? Predictably, the same media and tech conglomerates pushing the trans narrative suppress and vilify any balanced or nuanced voices of reason. Of the most egregious instances, GLAAD’s “Accountability Project” targets objectors so media can consider whether to “quote them” or continue to give them “unchallenged air time or ink.” Its initial release provoked understandable ire, and its updated edition includes J.K. Rowling.

Abigail Shrier’s name was listed, so please read her book, educate yourselves on the irreversible damage being done, and warn and inform others, such as the professionals at the Society for Evidence-based Gender Medicine and others are doing.

Read Walt Heyer as well as Ryan Anderson’s Amazon-banned book. Learn from Jennifer Bilek’s excellent writings and research into the profit motives. Beautiful reasoning can be found in psychiatrist Stephen Levine’s description of the complex process of consent, including a detailed discussion of 12 specific risks, that has been cast aside in favor of patient desire and autonomy as the sole requirement for accessing treatment (excellent and accessible summary discussions of Levine’s work are available here and here).

I wish Elliot Page all the best, but might even famous adults be casualties in this rush to affirm transition and lack of truly informed consent? As Levine writes, “There is much to suggest that the patient does not always know best — for example, post-transition depression, detransition, suicide rates both before and after surgery, and that researchers have concluded that postoperative patients need psychiatric care.”

Might a woman who experienced the constant spotlight on her body for the public gaze from girlhood have other motivations to remove her breasts and declare a male identity in a world where, as the Time article put it, “men’s bodies are less policed and scrutinized,” that at least deserve to be explored?

Among Levine’s overarching questions for truly informed consent are: “What do you understand about the common and rare, short- and long-term medical and health risks of hormone and surgical interventions?” and “What have you considered the nature of your life will be in 10 to 20 years?”

Recent research continues to show that it is often vulnerable minors with psychiatric co-morbidities and adverse childhood experiences presenting at gender clinics, and there is no Instagram filter to sift the influences directing them to the panacea for the emerging pandemic of being “born in the wrong body.”

Keep reaching across the aisle, as Scott Newgent and others are doing, to join with all people of goodwill for the sake of protecting children from medical transition to which they cannot consent. For those of faith, pray as never before for the body-soul integrity of your children and grandchildren to be preserved. “You have been a shelter, Lord, in every generation” — including this one.

What’s Inside The Gender-Bending Picture Books In Your Kids' Library,"Have you visited the children’s section of a public library or bookstore lately? You may be surprised by some of the books you find there. LGBT activists are aggressively presenting their ideology in books across the children’s genres: picture books, easy readers, and biographies.

For example, in “BunnyBear,” a cub feels like a bunny on the inside, so he is encouraged to embrace his bunny identity. In “Worm Loves Worm,” two worms get married. The dilemma? Guests wonder which will wear the tux and which wear the dress. And in “Jack not Jackie,” the message to readers is choose your gender, do what feels right for you.

The target age for these books? Ages 4–8. Surprised? It gets worse.

LGBTQ activists seek to indoctrinate even younger children in ABC books such as “The GayBC’s” by M. L. Webb. “B is for bi,” “G is for gay,” and “L is for lesbian.” The text that follows these entries explicitly supports LGBT behavior. After “B is for bi,” readers are told, “You can shout it out loud. I like boys and girls, and that makes me proud.”

The letter T “is for trans” and the text reads, “It’s a brave step to take to live as the gender you know is innate.” These explanations suggest that these feelings are not only normal but also admirable and desirable.

Think the books listed are exceptions? They’re not. When blogger and teacher Allison McDonald created a list of books in 2013 that promote LGBT families and their lifestyle, she named nine titles. In a 2020 post, she listed 72 books that promote the LGBT ideology.

She celebrates that her updated list contains titles for a broad range of ages, from board books to tween chapter books. She says, “LGBTQ children and their families deserve to be represented, celebrated, and included in all parts of life, including all bookshelves and storytimes.” I wonder if she equally supports traditional families and their values.

In the post, she shames those who “make these books ‘a sensitive subject’ to only be discussed at home.” She also asserts that if such topics are not promoted at school, we are teaching “our children that these topics are shameful, that these books are taboo, and in turn that the families and people portrayed in them are.”

Whatever happened to the conviction that parents know what is best for their children? Apparently, only professional educators can determine what children should and should not be taught.

McDonald is also not alone. Thousands of teachers across the nation are promoting LGBT ideology. Founded in 1990 by a group of teachers, the mission of GLSEN (Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network) is “to ensure that every member of every school community is valued and respected regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.”

With “43 chapters in 30 states,” this national network is “more than 1.5 million strong.” They declare that “it’s never too early for schools to set up a foundation of understanding and respect.”

Among best practices for classroom educators they recommend: “read LGBTQ-inclusive picture books” and “ensure that any lessons on families have examples of LGBTQ-headed families.” They also give guidelines for handling “pushback” from parents and community leaders.

GLSEN tells teachers to “avoid using to gender to separate students” and to promote “gender-inclusive language” by using their educator resources and pronoun lessons. As one New York preschool teacher said, “Everybody has the right to choose their own gender by listening to their own heart and mind. Everyone gets to choose if they are a boy or girl or both or neither or something else, and no one gets to choose for them.”

Why is it dangerous for our children to be exposed to these ideologies? Consider these sobering facts presented by Drs. Michelle Cretella, Quentin Van Meter, and Paul McHugh of the American College of Pediatrics:

Puberty-blocking hormones “induce a state of disease—the absence of puberty—and inhibit growth and fertility in a previously biologically healthy child.”

“According to the DSM-5, as many as 98% of gender confused boys and 88% of gender confused girls eventually accept their biological sex after naturally passing through puberty.”

Children who take puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones “will never be able to conceive any genetically related children even via artificial reproductive technology.”

For both children and adults, cross-sex hormones (testosterone and estrogen) are associated with dangerous health risks including but not limited to cardiac disease, high blood pressure, blood clots, stroke, diabetes, and cancer.

Our culture aggressively warns children and teens against substance abuse, yet it promotes behavior that can lead to these serious physical and psychological issues. Even besides these serious health consequences, we also know an overwhelming number of children outgrow gender confusion, so pushing confusion is both unhealthy and unnecessary.

The more children are exposed to a one-sided view of gender and sexual orientation, the less likely they are to approach these critical issues with a balanced, healthy viewpoint. For example, although the estimated LGBT population hovers around 4.5 percent of the total U.S. population, almost 16 percent of those aged 18–23 identify as LGBT. Why?

“Perhaps,” as Michael Brown suggests, “the disproportionate representation (and celebration of) LGBT characters on TV and Hollywood and comic books, not to mention the talking points in children’s schools, contributed to this misconception.”

Kids and teens long to be viewed as cool and popular. They want to stand out in the crowd. If you combine all the media attention showered on LGBT behavior with public education’s promotion, is it any wonder so many kids struggle with gender identity and express a desire to change their gender or sexual orientation?

What can you do? If your children attend public school, find out what curriculum your school district uses. Volunteer in your local public library or the library at your child’s school. Ask your child’s teacher if you can participate in storytime, then choose to read a book that promotes your values.

Check the recommended or required reading list for your child’s grade level. Read the books your children are reading at school and discuss questionable content with them. Ask open-ended questions about self-worth, gender, and identity. Listen to their thoughts and feelings, then express your values and why you hold them.

You’re still the most influential person in your child’s life. Don’t hand that privilege to anyone else.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/04/10/whats-inside-the-gender-bending-picture-books-in-your-childrens-library/,2021-04-10
"For Liberalism To Hold Any Meaning, Colleges Need Religious Exemptions","And then, they came for the Christian colleges. LGBT activists have launched a lawsuit seeking to deny federal funding to Christian colleges and universities that require students and staff to live according to Christian sexual teaching. In response, the Biden administration’s Department of Education, the ostensible defendant in the suit, may try for a quick “sue and settle” surrender to cut traditional religious colleges off from federal education dollars.

The legacy media has, of course, been sympathetic to the litigants, cheering what they see as the end of exemptions that let “anti-LGBT bigots” receive government funds. They view religious accommodations as antithetical to the rule of law — special privileges that allow believers to ignore the law. But religious accommodations are the price liberalism must pay for big government. The current lawsuit illustrates this truth.

First, the sexual orientation and gender identity non-discrimination regulations that religious colleges have sought exemptions from are not statutory laws. Rather, they are interpretations and rules created by bureaucrats and judges — not Congress — through successive rounds of regulation and litigation. They arise from the expanding administrative state, which regularly grants accommodations and exceptions for a multitude of reasons.

Indeed, the law at issue, Title IX, explicitly permits religious colleges and universities to retain their religious character while receiving federal funding. Thus, rather than unique exceptions to the rule of law, the exemptions granted to religious colleges and universities are the ordinary products of an expansive government responding to diverse circumstances.

This sort of legal and administrative discretion is important to effective government. Even the ever-growing Leviathan must retain some flexibility, and such elasticity is indispensable to big-government liberalism — at least if it is to remain liberal.

The promise of liberalism is that all are welcome in the liberal polity, and that sectarian conflict can be set aside within a common political framework. This promise has always been imperfectly realized, but the liberal claim is that it is not a joke for a priest, a rabbi, and a Buddhist monk to walk into a bar, or a courthouse, or a public university, as equal citizens.

The promise of everyone having a place in liberalism, however, means allowing associations in which not everyone has a place. To maintain their integrity and identity, religious communities and institutions must be able to exclude those who do not accept their beliefs or adhere to their rules.

Christian colleges and universities that seek to be communities of discipleship, as well as of mundane instruction, will necessarily insist that students and faculty try to live by Christian ethics, including sexual ethics. These restrain everyone, but concerning LGBT identities and actions, Christians believe that our essential identity is built on our relationship to Jesus Christ, not our sexual desires. It is rebellion to make temptation into an identity.

The obvious rejoinder, as illustrated by the current lawsuit, is that fomenting Christian identities should not be done with government funds. If orthodox Christians wish to run their colleges as they see fit, they should do so without taking federal money. There are several problems with this argument.

First, although a few Christian schools are proudly independent of federal funds, most are not, and would struggle to survive if suddenly cut off from them. While Christians have indeed built their own colleges, “build your own” is much harder when the government funds and controls everything, either directly or through extensive regulation. Many schools have a reliance interest on the promise that they would be able to access federal dollars without compromising their religious identity.

Second, when the government is a primary source of funding for higher education, requiring traditional religious schools to alter their beliefs to access it is a de facto punishment for their religious beliefs. To exclude these religious institutions for their authentic faith is to exclude religious citizens from liberalism’s promise of equality.

Third, it is naïve to think that avoiding federal dollars means avoiding federal interference. Federal funding isn’t why Jack Phillips and the Little Sisters of the Poor have been dragged into court again and again.

Eschewing government money might free Christian colleges from some intrusions under Title IX, but they will still be subject to other regulations by various governmental and quasi-governmental actors, from accreditors to athletic associations, which do not depend on accepting grants. For example, declining federal funds will not protect them from transgender mandates under Obamacare or the Bostock interpretation of Title VII.

By nature, big government imperils the liberal truce, in which citizens and institutions of disparate religious and metaphysical beliefs can live together in peace. The bigger the government, the more likely it is to impose or infringe upon the deeply held convictions of religious citizens and associations. Just as government-run health care will become entangled with religious hospitals, doctors, and nurses that refuse, for example, to commit abortions, government-funded higher education will become entangled with religious colleges that require students and faculty to adhere to religious beliefs and practices.

This problem is exacerbated because the presuppositions that underlay fashionable secular dogmas are often invisible to their adherents. For example, the claims of transgender ideology are not less metaphysical, or even mystical, for having been inculcated by the cultural osmosis of media saturation and peer pressure, rather than overt religious instruction and reflection. To insist that a man may become a woman, or that a man is, in some sense truer than biological sex, already a woman, is as bold a metaphysical assertion as anything proclaimed in religious teachings such as the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation.

Government enforcement of secular dogmas — e.g. by withholding otherwise-available funding from religious schools that do not accept claims of gender identity in place of biological sex — establishes an official orthodoxy. Under this regime, traditional religious believers and institutions will be systematically punished and excluded from equal participation in education, healthcare, and even from the market in general.

Even if the current lawsuit fails (full disclosure: my wife is an attorney with Alliance Defending Freedom, which is intervening on behalf of some of the colleges targeted by this lawsuit), there is still a powerful trend toward punishing religious believers and institutions that resist the sexual revolution.

Furthermore, the attacks on Christian institutions are accompanied by efforts to make participation in public, professional, and commercial life contingent on affirming ideas incompatible with traditional Christian teachings. Thus, believers may be pushed out of mainstream institutions even as our institutions are isolated and cut off from benefits that are available to everyone else.

This prospect may delight activists eager to punish those who do not embrace the latest demands of the LGBT lobby. But a regime that penalizes Christians who authentically live according to their beliefs is illiberal by definition, and thereby, by liberalism’s own standards, in danger of illegitimacy.

A more limited government would, of course, resolve many of these difficulties. But left-liberals must at least recognize that sustaining the bargain of liberalism in a time of big government and ascendant cultural leftism requires generous accommodations for traditional religious believers and their institutions. Without equality and tolerance for dissidents, both individually and within the community, there is no liberalism.

New California Law Could Put Male Serial Rapists Into Women’s Prisons,"On January 1, California’s SB-132, which mandates housing prisoners according to their gender identity, took effect. Since then, 261 transfer requests have been made under the law — nearly all men seeking transfers to women’s prisons.

To date, only a few transfers have occurred, with the Department of Corrections blaming COVID. While an evergreen excuse, in reality, SB-132 created a nightmare scenario, leaving prisons unable to protect female inmates if they actually do what the law requires.

Last September, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed SB-132 into law, declaring the statute represented another step forward in the march toward equality for LGBTQ people. Those championing the law, such as the bill’s author, state Sen. Scott Wiener, cheered the statute as supporting “the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation’s efforts to provide a safe, humane, respectful and rehabilitative environment for the incarcerated transgender, non-binary and intersex community.”

Instead, SB-132 creates unworkable mandates for the California prison system that place female inmates and correctional officers at risk. The only way to safeguard these women is for prisons to feign compliance with the law.

SB-132 consists of four sections, with Section 1 merely providing a marketable title for the bill, “The Transgender Respect, Agency, and Dignity Act.” Section 2 declares the legislative findings on which the state relied to enact the substantive provisions of the statute that follow in Sections 3 and 4.

Among other things, Section 2 explains what transgender, non-binary, and intersex mean, such as that “’transgender’ is broad and inclusive of all gender identities different from the gender a person was assigned at birth including, but not limited to, transsexual, two-spirit, and māhū.”

“Nonbinary” includes “individuals who may experience a gender identity that is neither exclusively male nor female or is in between or beyond both of those genders, including, but not limited to, gender fluid, agender or without gender, third gender, genderqueer, gender variant, and gender nonconforming.” Section 2 also highlights statistics of harassment and violence affecting transgender prisoners.

Section 3 then begins the substantive mandates of the law and provides that at the initial intake the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation shall ask for an inmate’s “gender identity of female, male, or nonbinary,” whether the individual “identifies as transgender, nonbinary, or intersex,” and “the individual’s gender pronoun and honorific.”

Inmates will Abuse the System

A prisoner cannot be disciplined for refusing to respond to these questions or for providing incomplete responses, but should a prisoner later decide to share (or change) this information, prison employees must again ask the inmates their preferred pronouns and honorifics. (The statute also defines gender pronouns with the ungrammatical explanation that “gender pronoun” mean a third-person singular personal pronoun, such as “he, she, or they.”) SB-132 then declares it illegal for a correctional officer to “consistently fail to use the gender pronoun and honorific an individual has specified.”

Anyone who thinks the prisoners won’t play up these supposed “protections” to harass prison staff or to file frivolous lawsuits is unacquainted with prisoner litigation and the penchant for those confined to pass time by filing meritless cases pro se, meaning without an attorney. In the federal court system alone, each of the 94 circuit courts is allocated “pro se law clerks” to screen cases filed by unrepresented individuals.

Further, according to federal statistics, prisoner petitions account for 69 percent of the pro se docket, and a whopping 91 percent of prisoner cases are filed without an attorney, with more than 900,000 such petitions clogging up federal courts between 2000 and 2019. While some prisoners have genuine claims, the overwhelming majority lack merit, which both wastes taxpayer resources and delays relief for prisoners presenting legitimate and potentially life-threatening complaints.

California’s promise of a pronoun-of-the-day will only further congest the courts’ dockets with frivolous claims. That negative does not address the real First Amendment violation the law inflicts on correctional officers when the state compels its employees to speak a falsehood — that he is a she, or she is a he.

SB-132 creates much graver problems than pronouns (although compelling false speech, especially in contravention to a person’s sincerely held religious beliefs, is a serious concern in its own right), with Section 4 mandating that prisoners be “housed at a correctional facility designated for men or women based on the individual’s preference.” Again, the plain language of Section requires prisoners to be housed based on their preference and not their sex. SB-132 thus gives male inmates the right to be housed in female prisons.

Zero Protections for Women

Supporters of the law suggest female prisoners will be protected because the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has the authority to deny a housing preference based on “management or security concerns.” But California has already transferred a violent baby killer to a women’s prison, and in Washington, a man housed in a female prison has been accused of rape. In short, the “management or security concerns” provision of SB-132 provides no protection for women, unless the Department of Correction ignores the mandates of the law.

Why? Because the language of the statute requires the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to accept an inmate’s self-defined gender identity, including a claim of a “non-binary gender,” and then prohibits the prison from denying the preferred placement “based on any discriminatory reason.”

While the statutory language provides some examples of inappropriate consideration for denying a housing placement, such as the inmate’s anatomy, genitalia, and other physical characteristics, the statute does not limit discrimination to those factors.

So, what happens when a lifer convicted of serial rapes declares himself transgender and seeks placement in a female prison? The Los Angeles Times reported that, according to one male prisoner who identifies as a woman, he “knows at least five inmates who have applied to transfer under false pretenses.”

The transgender inmate further claimed that staffers wanted him “in a confidential setting to tell them who is transgender and who is not, so they can block some of these guys from going to the women’s prison.” “I told him I don’t have a problem with it … We feel they’re climbing our backs,” the inmate added.

But the law, if followed, requires prisons to accept the inmate’s self-declaration. In fact, in an online Q&A, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation stated that it “does not determine an incarcerated person’s gender identity. Every incarcerated person self-identifies.”

If the prison is not allowed to determine a person’s gender identity, surely the law would not allow a fellow inmate to do so!

But what about the fact that the prisoner, after years of identifying as a male, “came out” as transgender (or non-binary?) Shouldn’t that matter? Nope. Discrimination based on the longevity of the gender identity. And haven’t they heard of rapid-onset gender dysphoria?

What about the prisoner’s underlying conviction? Nope. Discrimination against sex offenders.

Yet the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation pretends it can legally weed out security risks for women, stating that “all requests for housing based on gender identity will be reviewed by a multi-disciplinary classification committee” that will “review all case factors and the individual’s history to make a recommendation.”

But on what non-discriminatory factor could the committee do so, with the possible exception of the prisoner having engaged in violence while in prison? There aren’t any, which is why in practice the committee will likely deny male prisoners access to female prison based on the prison administrators’ personal view of the inmate’s professed gender identity — even though the law mandates otherwise.

Or the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation will rely on COVID or overcrowding or some other management issue to deny the transfers. But that will not end the matter because the inmate whose transfer was rejected may challenge the denial through the prison grievance procedure, and likely later by litigation, and he can later seek another transfer by raising new safety concerns.

There is truly no end to the harm the California legislature unleashed on the prison system and its female inmates (and guards) under the guise of protecting transgender inmates from violence, which of course should be done. But you don’t address violence against transgender inmates by risking the safety of female prisoners.

Unfortunately, the common sense answer of housing transgender prisoners with others of the same sex in designated wings or units, is illegal, as California explained in its Q&A section:

So, with federal law tying their hands and state law mandating the absurd, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation will talk the talk, while slow-walking men to the women’s prisons. If this solution is a step forward for LGBTQ people, it’s only because society cares not for the women stomped on during the march.

"To Combat HIV, LGBT Americans Need To Wrestle With Some Hard Truths","The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released a survey reporting that 4 in 10 males identifying as female who live in large cities are HIV-positive. Described as one of the most comprehensive surveys of the “transgender population,” approximately 1,600 Americans polled from seven major cities were asked a series of questions about their sex lives and experiences with HIV.

The CDC states, “These findings demonstrate the pressing need for scaled-up HIV prevention and care strategies for transgender women. CDC is actively working to address disparities through strategic program funding and partnerships throughout the nation.”

Commenting on the data, Demetre Daskalakis, director of CDC’s Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention argues, “These data provide a clear and compelling picture of the severe toll of HIV among transgender women and the social and economic factors — including systemic racism and transphobia — that are contributing to this unacceptable burden.” Daskalakis continued, “Reducing HIV in these communities will require that public health and other providers of social and prevention services design innovative and comprehensive status-neutral solutions to overcome barriers to whole person prevention and care.”

The data itself tells a remarkably different story than the one presented by the CDC, however, almost entirely debunking several of these claims. While the CDC’s commentary highlights popular narratives such as transphobia, poverty, and a lack of access to medical services, the vast majority of men identifying as women do not self-report these issues.

Between 30 and 39 percent of transgender males have graduated high school or attended college. Nearly 60 percent reported stable housing and nearly 90 percent reported having health insurance, with 96 percent having seen a doctor in the last year.

Ninety percent of those who were HIV-positive reported taking HIV medications and 89 percent had seen an HIV specialist in the last six months. Participants living with HIV also indicated they had access to transgender-related medical intervention as well with 78 percent undergoing hormone treatment.

The data shows that the vast majority of men identifying as women who wanted to transition and manage their HIV with medication had the ability and opportunity to do so. This was true regardless of race, with nearly 90 percent of black and Hispanic participants reporting access to medical intervention and 100 percent of white participants reporting the same.

Education and awareness also did not appear to be an issue, as nearly 70 percent had engaged in HIV-related interventions and nearly 90 percent had access to free condoms and HIV-prevention medication known as PrEP. More than 85 percent across all categories had been tested for HIV in the last year. Indeed, there don’t appear to be any disparities in education, access to education, awareness, or access to prevention methods in this population.

Despite the abundant resources available and used to prevent the spread of HIV, the survey provided insight into why the infection rate was so high. To begin with, around 36 percent of respondents self-reported engaging in high-risk sexual activities without using a condom and 34 percent reported engaging in prostitution. Around 60 percent engaged in substance abuse, which increases the risk of HIV infection, according to the CDC.

Equally as discouraging, despite access to and widespread use of transgender medical intervention with surgery and hormones, overall, 18 percent had seriously considered suicide in the last year and 4 percent had attempted self-harm. As for living in violent environments, 26 percent of 18 to 24-year-old participants reported abuse from their intimate partners. This supports another recent survey by the UCLA Williams Institute that indicated 43 per 1,000 transgender people were victimized by their intimate partner.

Despite the CDC narrative suggesting a lack of resources, awareness, and education about HIV testing and treatment, it seems transgender males are more than sufficiently knowledgeable on the risk factors, and a prominent segment simply chooses to engage in them anyway. This significantly challenges the overall LGBT narrative of HIV as being a disease of poverty and oppression in the United States, one that requires further government funding to address through more and more programs and outreach efforts.

The data tells a different story, and it’s an important one to pay attention to. While the discussion is not around blame, there is a significant component of personal and social responsibility at play here that needs to be addressed.

As has been true since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the largest contributing factor to the spread of the disease has been leftist cultural influences that encourage reckless sexual and drug use practices as normal and accepted, particularly among LGBT Americans. The refusal to acknowledge this reality is perpetuated by leftist social policy, such as California lowering the criminal consequences for intentionally exposing others to HIV.

The truth is, LGBT and transgender Americans don’t as a population need more education and awareness about HIV, nor do we require more government-funding services for outreach, free prevention materials, and even more options for access to medical services at low or no cost . As the data show, these are in abundant supply and are widely used by LGBT Americans.

No, what this segment of the American population needs is an uncomfortable conversation about the consequences of encouraging and even celebrating prostitution, reckless sexual practices, and recreational drug use. Perpetuating victim-messaging and highlighting meaningless disparities will do nothing but allow the underlying problems influencing the spread of HIV amongst LGBT Americans to continue.

Pricey Manhattan Catholic Prep School Promotes False Gender Ideology,"One of the most prestigious private schools in the nation, based in Manhattan, hosted an LGBTQ+ “Ally Week” for students last week.

Marymount School of New York, a pre-K through 12 all-girls Catholic institution with a tuition near $54,000 per year in the elite Upper East Side of New York City, hosted four days of leftist gender theory indoctrination. Each day had a theme. The themes, in order, were “Sexuality & Gender,” “LGBTQ+ history and important figures!” “How To Be An Ally,” and a “Day of Silence.”

Ally Week was hosted by “Prism,” a campus group that hosts “Bias Awareness Day” in addition to Ally Week and “aims to increase awareness about sexuality and gender diversity within Marymount and in the greater community.” Jacqueline André, a French teacher who serves as an advisor for the group, did not respond to a request for comment.

One father who is pulling his eighth-grade daughter out of the school due to disagreeing with the week, among other administrative decisions, told The Federalist “the school is veering too hard left of its core mission of teaching students to be great critical thinkers with good values.”

Indeed, the school’s founding mission statement written in 1926 by Irish nun Marie Joseph Butler bears no relation to the attempts by the administration to bring politics into the classroom while not providing students a dissenting viewpoint. The mission statement reads: “Marymount School is an independent, Catholic day school that seeks to educate young women who continue to question, risk, and grow—young women who care, serve, and lead—young women prepared to challenge, shape, and change the world.”

The school has come under pressure lately. On Tuesday, Daily Mail broke a story that found Marymount hosted an exclusive welcome reception for “parents of new students of color” as part of its “anti-racist” initiative. “Marymount is one of many posh private schools that has recently been roiled over progressive platforms,” the New York Post said.

An alum who spoke to Daily Mail on condition of anonymity asked a simple question: “Where is the protection of innocence?”

Ally Week, Day One

Ally Week began with the theme “Sexuality & Gender.” The email sent out to students attempted to explain the supposed differences between sexuality and gender, noting that “[t]ypically people incorrectly conflate the definition of sex with ‘sex assigned at birth'” and that “[g]ender is associated with how a person expresses themself.” The school also claimed there are “upwards of 46 different sexes.”

Dr. Yajun Wu, assistant department head of biology and microbiology at South Dakota State University, said in an interview that “when we talk about biology, we talk about female and male.”

“That’s [what] everyone knows,” Wu added.

Yet, included in the Marymount email was a diagram called “The Genderbread Person.” The diagram implies identity is associated with the brain, while sex is related only to one’s genitals. It also goes so far as to say masculinity and femininity are part of “gender expression.” See below:

Mary Hasson, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and the director of the Catholic Women’s Forum, said the above diagram is frequently used to promote gender ideology.

“This image and its variations (gender unicorn, gender elephant, and earlier iterations of the genderbread person) have been used for years now by activists in government, education, and elsewhere to promote a flawed understanding of the person,” Hasson said. “The idea of the person, as presented in this diagram, is incompatible with the Christian understanding of the person. It does not belong in a Catholic school. Ever.”

“It is brainwashing,” the father of the eighth-grade daughter concerning the diagram. “It’s the equivalent of giving drugs. They’re normalizing bad behavior in sweet, innocent tones for things that are very weird and very complex.”

Students were instructed to answer the following questions after reading the day one material:

“Can you explain the difference between sexuality, gender, and sex?”

“Why is gender not a binary concept?”

“Why are using affirming pronouns important? If stuck here, read this Guide to Pronouns for LGBTQ+ Allies from UC Davis!”

Ally Week, Day Two

On Wednesday, Ally Week focused on “LGBTQ+ history and important figures.” Students read in homeroom about figures including drag queen Marsha P. Johnson, Danish transgender artist Lili Elbe, National LGBTQ task force co-founder Bruce Voeller, and transgender actress Ellen Page. All were celebrated because of their perceived gender identity.

“Elliot Page is an actor and activist who has been working in film for many years, and in December 2020, he came out as a transgender man,” the email said. “Throughout his career, Page has campaigned for LGBTQ+ representation and has starred in and produced films that highlight the community.”

Students were told to purchase the music of artists mentioned because they are “LGBTQ+.”

“There are also SO many musicians who are part of the LGBTQ+ community,” the school said. “So many that we in Prism can’t decide on the best ones to recommend to you! So we will let you explore on your own. Ultimately though, the best support you can give is to buy their music!”

Ally Week, Day Three

On Thursday, the theme was “How to be an Ally.” Marymount told students they must “confront your own bias, even if it is uncomfortable.” The school claimed straight people “have a different kind of privilege.” Just as critical race theory communicates to students that silence indicates racism, Marymount claimed “[t]here is no such thing as a silent Ally.”

Marymount linked to a video by Lifehacker instructing students on “how to be a better Ally.” One of the speakers argued that straight people need to stop talking over LGBTQ+ peers.

After watching the video, students played a game in homeroom called “Put a Finger Down.” The object of the game was for students to reaffirm the points outlined in the email by raising their fingers if they agree with the controversial sentiments put forth by the school. For example, students gained points in the game if “[y]ou work to normalize gender inclusive terminology (having your pronouns in your instagram bio, using partner or significant other at times).”

However, students were awarded negative points in the game for things like if “[y]ou consider yourself an Ally but haven’t taken any concrete steps for that statement to mean anything” or if “[y]ou rely on your LGBTQ+ friends for education on LGBTQ+ topics.” Below is the document The Federalist obtained from Marymount explaining the game.

Ally Week, Day Four

The final day of Ally Week was in regard to the “Day of Silence.”

“The Day of Silence is a national student-led demonstration where LGBTQ students and allies all around the country—and the world—take a vow of silence to protest the harmful effects of harassment and discrimination of LGBTQ+ people in schools,” the email to students read.

In addition, students discussed “coming out” and Prism advised students on the “Do’s” and “Don’ts” of gender theory. One of the things the school instructed students against is assuming a student’s “identity,” even though of course one can discern someone else’s sex by appearance.

Praying To Their Woke Version Of God

A parent who wishes to remain anonymous forwarded The Federalist an unlisted video published by a user named Alice Kearney Alwin of a school chapel service on April 12. Sure enough, gender ideology was heavily infused. The school subsequently made the video private.

The very first clip of the chapel service is a student placing an LGBTQ rainbow mask over a statue of Mary. Subsequently, students hold up various messaging posters — with one saying “Black Lives Matter.”

An educator who is employed in the Religious Studies department spoke for about 10 minutes. At around the seven minute mark, the teacher condemned the Vatican for its position that priests and ministers cannot bless same-sex marriages due to the biblical view that homosexuality is a sin. Note that in the Bible, (Leviticus 18:22) it says, “You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is abomination.”

The teacher cited an article by The New York Times on the topic, and used Jesus to condemn the church and society.

“After reading this article, I couldn’t help but to recall Jesus’s words to love your neighbor,” the teacher said. ” …As we embark on a journey to widen the circle of inclusion, we must also face the reality that we as humans need to do more than simply extend the circle. We need to dismantle and redefine the entire circumference of inclusion. Just as Jesus was doing 2,000 years ago.”

“We are humans who bear witness to systems of power and oppression on a daily basis, ” the teacher said at around 11 minutes.

The French teacher who helped organized Ally Week led a prayer at around 13 minutes. In the prayer, André said that “LGBTQIA+ people have been ostracized, oppressed, and marginalized.”

“We pray that humanity can grow and evolve to make space for all forms of love,” André said. “Let us work to see, respect, and appreciate everyone, in our community and to be inclusive in our thoughts, words, and actions. We pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer. For LGBTQIA+ people and for those whose sexual or gender identifiers make them feel set apart. That they may know they have allies in their struggle for full acceptance in the church and in the world …we pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer.”

At the end of chapel, students watched the music video for rapper Mackelmore and Ryan Lewis’s song “Same Love.”

‘Effectively Normalizing’

The father who is moving his daughter to another school said the purported Catholic school “is effectively normalizing [being LGBTQ] and making it cute.”

“When you’ve got girls that are just learning about all these things, which they really shouldn’t be doing at school anyway, it’s very confusing,” he said. “It’s very problematic to tell a girl that it is not just mom and dad, but that there are 46 sexes. What nonsense is this?”

The father added that the teachers are acting like “extreme political leaders.”

Administrators, including headmistress Concepcion R. Alvar, did not return emails or calls from The Federalist. The director of communications at Marymount, Jennifer Cyranski, did not respond.

“Schools exist to serve families, to assist in educating their children according to a shared vision,” Hasson said. “So, at least for private schools, parents are in the driver’s seat. Parents should question the administration and make their concerns known. If a school is unresponsive or insists on promoting this devastatingly harmful ideology, then parents should withdraw their children and find another school.”

“If enough parents do so, then I suspect some of these schools will rethink their attachment to gender ideology,” Hasson said.

"Ken Starr Is Right About Religious Liberty, But That Might Not Preserve It","A federal lawsuit filed on March 29 against the U.S. Department of Education cites 33 current and former LGBTQ students at federally funded Christian colleges and universities for what the nonprofit Religious Exemption Accountability Project refers to as “unconstitutional discriminatory policies.”

According to the class-action suit, the religious exemption status of the 25 listed schools allows them to maintain discriminatory policies while receiving government funding. This suit, perhaps intentionally, follows the recent passage of the Equality Act in the House — effectively adding gender identity and sexuality to the groups protected under the Civil Rights Act — which is now with the Senate.

The lawsuit and the bill represent a significant escalation of attacks on religious liberty within the first 100 days of the Biden administration. Religious Liberty in Crisis: Exercising Your Faith in an Age of Uncertainty, by former solicitor general of the United States, Baylor University president, and dean of the Pepperdine University School of Law is thus well timed. Indeed, Baylor is one of the 25 schools named in the class-action suit (perhaps surprisingly, Pepperdine, which also has strong evangelical chops, is not).

Starr’s book is an excellent introduction to the principles of American legal and jurisprudence as they relate to religious liberty, although lawsuits like the one mentioned above may make manifest the weaknesses of those very same principles.

‘A Moral and Religious People’

Certainly, the founders believed the American experiment would succeed only with a religiously inclined and moral people. As John Adams famously asserted: “Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.” That same generation also ensured that the goods of religion were explicitly endorsed in the nation’s early legal documents and traditions.

Congress’s 1787 Northwest Ordinance, for example, explicitly declares: “Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools, and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.” Or consider that among the liberties protected in the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights, religion is first, both in the rejection of establishmentarianism – which was as much about protecting churches from encroachment by the state as it was about rejecting theocracy – as well as in the prohibition of limiting the “free exercise” of religion.

One might then reasonably argue that religious belief and practice is the foremost freedom guaranteed by our constitutional government, as well as essential to republicanism. As Starr explains, “The First Amendment does not so much create a ‘wall of separation’ between the church and the state, but rather a ‘wall of protection’ so that faith communities can freely chart their own course without disrupting significant public interests.”

This points to one of Starr’s so-described fundamental principles: non-denigration, which holds that no practice can be used to denigrate minority or faith traditions. “Absent compelling reasons, the government cannot pass laws that target religious institutions in discriminatory ways; and government entities cannot interfere with religious institutions,” Starr observes.

Yet there are other principles at work in American law and jurisprudence affecting religious protections. The principle of neutrality, which flows out of the establishment clause, “requires the state to be a neutral in its relations with groups of religious believers and nonbelievers; it does not require the state to be their adversary,” in the words of Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black. In applying this principle, the courts have for example ruled that religious institutions can receive equal access to government programs, so long as those programs are not designed to directly promote religious liberty (see Aguilar v. Felton).

Yet another principle is that of accommodation, meaning that the U.S. Government “can and should accommodate the religious needs and expressions of the American people,” according to Starr. This principle is not necessarily in conflict with that of non-favoritism (there should be no deliberate exclusion of certain faith communities). Rather, accommodation is in play when the U.S. government respects and even sponsors the traditions, symbols, and practices of Americans.

So, for example, chaplaincies have been funded for the House and Senate since the very first Congress. Prayers are offered before congressional proceedings. The White House participates in a yearly Christmas tree decoration. And crosses, like the targeted one in Bladensburg, Maryland, are permitted on government property. “History and tradition, taken together, actually form a method of interpreting the Constitution,” says Starr.

Moreover, Congress and the courts have periodically recognized the “beneficial and stabilizing influence” of religious institutions in “community life,” to use the language of Walz v. Tax Commission. In the 1892 decision Holy Trinity v. United States, Justice David Brewer emphatically declared that America is “a Christian nation.”

Relying on the scholarly work of Robert Putnam and David Campbell in their book American Grace, Starr cites various examples of how religion operates as undeniable good for American society. Among other things, churches and religious institutions are responsible for food pantries, clothing banks, tutoring services, disaster relief work, prison ministry, and various forms of counseling.

The ministerial exemption — which protects churches from being sued for discrimination by their ministers and teachers, particularly if those ministers or teachers were fired for theological reasons — also reflects historic American appreciation of religious faith and practice. The purpose of the ministerial exemption is to avoid a scenario in which the state dictates to a religious institution who it can hire or fire, thus violating the principle of non-denigration. As Justice Samuel Alito explained: “Religious autonomy means that religious authorities must be free to determine who is qualified to serve in positions of substantial religious importance.”

Religious Liberty vs. Identitarianism

All of this might lead one to be as sanguine as Starr, who assesses that a robust, consistent tradition of protecting faith and practice over 200 years of law and jurisprudence provides a daunting bulwark against opponents to religious freedom. I agree that there is some reason for hope, not only because historical American jurisprudence has frequently been friendly to religion, but because the current composition of the Supreme Court is decidedly pro-religion. Yet I have perhaps more serious concerns, in part because of the character of the American founding as it related to religion, as well as because of broader socio-cultural trends affecting our nation.

As scholar C.C. Pecknold has noted, “the founders compromised on a vaguely philosophical conception of God, knowing that (a) the states were mostly confessional states, with thicker civil religions — Episcopalian, Baptist, basically Protestant; and (b) the pantheistic and deistic tendency could be placated this way.” Yet such an underspecification inclined to a Lockean view of religion, which in turn tended toward indifferentism regarding true/false distinctions in religion. This was and is inherently unstable, and we are increasingly witnessing its effects.

Take, for example, the lawsuit cited above regarding LGBTQ students at religious universities, which argues that religious exemptions violate the Constitution’s equal protection clause by singling out LGBTQ students as a “socially despised group for legal disfavor.” One might also cite the continuing controversy regarding Colorado cake baker Jack Philips, who has refused to participate in homosexual weddings because doing so would violate his religious beliefs. Starr defends people like Philips by claiming that such “honest, law-abiding Americans” do not intend to harm anyone.

But such reasoning is not particularly persuasive to LGBTQ leftists and their allies. Indeed, such persons view LGBTQ access to cake baking, wedding photography, or any other service to be just as important to an earlier black generation’s access to water fountains, bathrooms, and restaurants. The latter are protected under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, originally aimed at protecting disenfranchised black Americans. LGBTQ students at religious schools argue the former should be as well.

Imagine a businessperson refusing service to an interracial couple for their upcoming wedding, on the grounds of his religious beliefs (perhaps he believes that the “Sons of Ham” are cursed). Presumably no court in this country would honor such a religious exemption. Yet what makes race different from sexuality or gender? All, according to U.S. law, are now protected under the Fourteenth Amendment. So who, exactly, should win in a battle between the person flying the religious liberty flag and the person flying another identitarian flag?

The problem, I would submit, is that because the framers refrained from providing any definition of what represents good and true religion worthy of being defended, and what represents abhorrent religion unworthy of legal protection, the ultimate result are dilemmas like that described above. Those who adhere to the natural law think there are important distinctions between race and sexuality, ones that would necessitate protecting the former and not necessarily the latter as they relate to religious liberty. But the framers failed to sufficiently define what religions or beliefs are worthy of protection and which are not, deferring to states, many of which still recognized an established church.

Or consider Wisconsin v. Yoder, which protected Amish communities and the education of their children on the grounds that state interests must yield to a religious community’s “profound interest in preserving their religious way of life,” as Starr puts it. But what kind of criteria is “profundity”?

Are any and all religious communities worthy of legal protection as long as they demonstrate a profound interest in trying to protect their religious traditions? What about a religion that engages in Satanic worship, witchcraft, cultic prostitution, or the sacrifice of endangered species? Indeed, the state has often demonstrated its willingness to interfere in religion when there are compelling reasons, such as various criminal activities.

Moreover, one can easily imagine the principle of accommodation disintegrating in our increasingly post-religious American culture — a recent Gallup poll found that American church membership has fallen below the majority for the first time in almost a century. It is conceivable that anti-religious Americans may argue that just as constitutional and jurisprudence acceptance of slavery and discrimination (see the Constitution’s “Three-Fifths” clause, Dred Scott v. Sandford or Plessy v. Ferguson) represented an immoral, irrational tradition, so are those traditions representative of Christianity. No more chaplaincies or White House Christmas trees. Or perhaps there will be a demand that the next congressional chaplains are Wiccans!

Threats and Doubts

Starr recognizes these threats to religious liberty. His practical suggestions to combat them are threefold: get elected, vote your faith, and become a genuine friend of freedom. However, those with antipathies towards many forms of Christianity and other religious traditions believe it is precisely those religions that are the opponents of true freedom.

What is more important: one’s religious belief, which many characterize as simply a subjective choice; or one’s racial, sexual, or gender identity, which many define as a biological given? Or perhaps even more sinister, what if American civil religion finds its fulfillment not in some generic Judaeo-Christian ethic, but racial, sexual, and gender identitarianism?

As Pecknold observes: “The ‘Great Awokening’ is an attempt to give civil religion some real doctrines, real moral claims on lives. It’s both a parasite on the old underdetermined civil religion, and a brand new, bolder civil religion.”

Federal American law and jurisprudence have never sought to coherently and consistently define what constitutes legitimate religion — apart from such acts as once demanding that conscientious-objector emanate from belief in a “supreme being” — largely because of the influence of disestablishmentarianism and indifferentism. Perhaps that worked when the majority of Americans adhered to a shared, coherent ethical and cultural framework that owed its character to Christianity. Those days are increasingly behind us.

Classical liberalism, its adherents often argue, is designed to accommodate all religions and none. But, says Pecknold, “this amounts to a non-answer which insists on toleration while the Woke Hierarchy establishes its church.”

In an America increasingly antagonistic to many traditional forms of religious practice, especially those who are suspicious of the sexual revolution, it’s worth questioning the strength of our legal and jurisprudential levees against the progressivist flood. As a person of religious conviction, I confess I have my doubts.

Including Queer Sexuality Actually Means Excluding Women,"Things are certainly not all peace, love, and understanding in the world of LGBT activism, and no one knows this better than lesbians. Just like women’s locker rooms, their unique spaces are being erased by men who believe they are women. Indeed, The New York Times recently noted the death of the lesbian bars but delicately refused to connect the dots to why.

Also highlighted by The New York Times, The Lesbian Bar Project was founded last October to lament the fact there remains only a small handful of lady meet-up watering holes in the entire United States, where there used to be hundreds. Leftist California has precisely as many lesbian bars as backwater Alabama: one. New York tops the nation with three — all in Gotham. Most states, however, now have none.

So, what’s up? Are women losing interest in women? No, such spaces are dying because biological men who believe they are women are demanding full inclusion in lesbian spaces as unquestioned equals, insisting actual women put on a smile and adjust their plans accordingly.

This fact is unwittingly captured in the Lesbian Bar Project’s own definition of what a lesbian bar is:

We believe that what makes a bar uniquely Lesbian is its prioritization of creating space for people of marginalized genders; including women, non-binary folks, and trans men. … As these spaces aim to be inclusive of all individuals across the diverse LGBTQIA+ community, the label Lesbian belongs to all people who feel that it empowers them.

Yes, the capricious and unbending god of gender inclusion requires the Lesbian Bar Project to define “lesbian” right out of a lesbian bar because being lesbian turns out to be a bit too binary and “bioessentialist,” the new unpardonable sin in queer politics. The problem, however, is certainly not confined to lesbian bars.

Zoe, one of the largest lesbian dating sites, proudly declares itself “the World’s Best Ranked Dating App for Queer Women.” The word “lesbian” is quickly falling out of fashion and is only used once on the entire website. They favor the term queer instead.

Her, another popular lesbian dating site, goes even further, banning both the L- and W-word, explaining they exist “for queer womxn, by queer womxn” and exist “to connect womxn and queer people.” Users enter by clicking the de-gendered red button marked “Find your person.” Inclusivity now excludes women.

Lesbians and other feminists have properly excoriated this erasure. But they are being told to hush and go along. The Washington Post recently charged in a banner headline that saying lesbians are going extinct is “the latest form of transphobia.”

The article trains both barrels on gay rights trailblazer Andrew Sullivan because he had the temerity to ask plaintively, “Where have all the lesbians gone?” Drawing attention to this inconvenient fact in queer politics today, Sullivan observes, “The social justice revolution has space for … dozens of pronouns, but not so much leeway for women who love women and not men.”

Sullivan is dead right on. Before our eyes, the trans movement is eclipsing the women’s movement. Literally and explicitly, gender studies have displaced women’s studies.

Of course, the false and wholly manufactured claim that “trans rights are human rights” cannot peacefully coexist with the inherently true claim that “women’s rights are human rights.” Exemplifying the very strange fork that queer politics has brought us to, J.K. Rowling has been called out in the most violent and misogynistic ways by trans activists for simply reminding the world we have a perfectly lovely word to describe “people who menstruate.”

Another feisty woman who knows about this all too well is Kellie-Jay Keen, a delightfully opinionated British women’s rights activist who heads Standing for Women. She was forced to take down a billboard she paid to have erected in Liverpool because its simple message asserting the most basic biological fact was deemed transphobic. What was so offensive? Her minimalist advert merely stated the word “woman” means “adult human female.”

The BBC reported a man succeeded in getting the billboard removed by simply claiming it was a “symbol that makes transgender people feel unsafe.” Keen deftly explained to Sky News why this man and his buddies were wrong, “I have led as much a transphobic campaign as you have led a misogynist one.” Yet the men in dresses prevailed.

In the blink of an eye, it’s evident biological men who believe they are women are far more favorably situated in the LGBT power differential than actual women. Just consider how President Biden’s day-one groundbreaking trans activism unwittingly erased what a Hillary presidency was supposed to have gained for women.

Abortion supporters have long and proudly claimed they stand for “women’s health care.” But we’re now told such language is transphobic and to be avoided because “We do pregnant people a huge disservice when we imply with our word choices that cisgender women are the only ones who need reproductive care.”

Pregnant people? Of course, because as HuffPost informs us, “Women aren’t the only people who get abortions” as “men and other gender non-conforming folks get abortions too.” Even the academic Journal of Women’s Health declares “It’s time for OBGYNs to care for people of all genders.”

Like the lesbian bar, you would imagine La Leche League would be another ultimate safe woman’s space. Not so. The organization officially explains that trans inclusion requires, “All nursing parents need support and La Leche League is a great place to find it.” Staff, volunteers, and clients are now encouraged to use the term “chestfeeding” to “express support for parents of all gender identities and all family structures.”

Yes, the word “breasts” can make trans men feel uncomfortable, so Le Leche even allows trans men to lead “chestfeeding” classes. One of the most famous is Canadian Trevor MacDonald, a goatee’d trans man who has written instructional materials for La Leche League and “new breastfeeding parents.” “Mother,” you see, is now a naughty word in the breastfeeding world.

Even Piers Morgan scolded CNN last summer for their silly public service announcement that “Individuals with a cervix are now recommended to start cervical cancers screening…”

Clearly, as it now goes in the LGBT social justice economy, old-fashioned misogyny clearly ranks well below trans-misogyny as an intolerable offense. Worse, misogyny is not only tolerated but enlisted as a weapon of choice in the internecine LGBT culture war.

Again, the overarching troubling dynamic is this: Trans rights and women’s rights cannot coexist and are inherently competing claims. Thus far during the current cannibalization of the LGBT political construct, the “Ts” and “Qs” are rapidly consuming the “Ls.”

All of this should have been easily anticipated by anyone who took the truth claims of gender theory seriously. If male and female are merely social constructs and binarity is the new flat earth, then the spectrum — and every possible new gender and sexual orientation it can dream up — must always prevail.

Ultimately, in this terribly problematic turn for a movement that is supposed to be all about advancing human rights, lesbians are the canaries in the coal mine.

There Is No Way To 'Fix' The Equality Act. It's Harmful No Matter What,"On May 15, Fox News reported that three Republican senators would like to write caveats into the Equality Act that might give them the political cover to vote for the bill to criminalize free speech and Christianity in the United States.

“Representatives from the offices of Sens. Thom Tillis, R-N.C.; Rob Portman, R-Ohio and Susan Collins, R-Maine, met with groups including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), Concerned Women for America, the Family Research Council and American Principles Project, sources said.”

FRC President Tony Perkins says that wasn’t his group’s goal for the meetings at all. Orthodox faith groups don’t want to be bamboozled into appearing to support a “compromise” on a bill that legally advantages LGBT people to make Christians second-class American citizens and punish free speech, both constitutionally protected rights.

Discussing the myriad of threats contained in the Equality Act w. Senate staff isn’t the equivalent of crafting a compromise bill. There can be NO COMPROMISE on the 1st Amendment. It is for every American & cannot be limited to religious orgs or churches. https://t.co/bfvnZuuugk — Tony Perkins (@tperkins) May 15, 2021

The goal of these discussions, Fox’s sources claim, is to essentially pass a federal law that secures legal preferences for LGBT people while making carve-outs for religious groups. The Equality Act and its weaker competitor, The Fairness For All Act, both would permanently enshrine in federal law President Biden’s executive orders that transgender and de-gender everything the federal government touches, which by now is most of society.

The point of this maneuver is obvious: to fool the religious Americans who largely vote Republican into continuing to do so while Republicans actively undermine their interests and the Constitution.

Pretending a “compromise” is possible here is a fool’s errand in more ways than one. Fundamentally, it’s foolish because it’s not possible to both uphold the U.S. Constitution and the identity politics regime. The two are fundamentally irreconcilable, as Christopher Caldwell explains in detail. The only option is to choose which master Americans will be forced to serve: Ordered freedom or sexual chaos.

The libertarian-minded — or those who use libertarian-sounding arguments to provide cover for Republicans to collude with Democrats in destroying the Constitution — have always proclaimed they don’t care what people do in their personal lives. That’s been a strawman this whole time, and this discussion illuminates that fact.

Percentage-wise, essentially none of the modern LGBT legal enterprise has been about simply protecting what a tiny minority of people do in private. For one thing, natural rights don’t stop being legally enforceable once you enter a private domain. One’s natural right to life, for example, is justly protected also in the privacy of one’s home.

For another thing, none of LGBT political efforts have been about private matters. They have been about public matters, such as whether the state grants marriage certificates or will assign children to a certain home, or will allow people to manufacture children to order that they cannot generate with their own bodies.

Statistically speaking, nobody wants gay people forced to die alone without their families, or denied health insurance or a place to sleep at night. There are legal solutions to all such things that don’t involve erasing women’s sports and forcing Christian churches to be bankrupted by lawsuits from anti-religious cranks with axes to grind.

Nobody supports extreme caricatures like police bursting into gay men’s homes at night while they sleep peacefully. That didn’t even happen to known homosexuals in the “bad old” “repressive” Victorian days of Oscar Wilde, who was actually prosecuted because his sexual appetite started consuming children. He lived under an avowedly Christian regime and he was allowed to groom and molest minors with frankly mild consequences.

And some sort of revival of Victorian morality is nowhere near imminent. Anyone who thinks otherwise lives in the Upside Down. So all this “Handmaids Tale” hysteria about the “religious right’s” hatred for gay people is, quite frankly, a giant smear job designed to foment hatred.

Yes, there are inconsiderate and insensitive people in every group, but as a mass Christians love gay and transgender people just like we do every other sinner on the planet, which is every single person who exists, including ourselves. It’s part of our religion to do that, okay?

Kindness and goodwill are not the issue here, the issue is legalized discrimination designed to end Americans’ constitutionally protected rights to freely associate, speak, and worship. It is a question of which of two irreconcilable sexual regimes Americans will live within, and which is best for the whole of us. The more we can be distracted into arguing about alleged bigotry and meanness, the less we focus on this paramount question. For some that is a goal, and it’s worth pondering why.

Furthermore, if any side of this dispute has been invading privacy, it has been the LGBT activist side. LGBT activists aggressively use state power to invade others’ privacy, such as in forcing men into women’s showers and sports teams, conscripting people to bake cakes and express messages with flowers, and making people unemployable for privately disagreeing with their theology.

All Christians ask of LGBT representatives is what they claim to want from us: that we be allowed to live freely in accord with our beliefs. It seems that is too much for those using the LGBT issue to achieve larger goals of erasing what remains of Americans’ constitutional protections.

Enshrining legal preferences for same-sex masturbation, politically selected racial groups, biological sex, and the rest of the identity politics mess of pottage creates a direct and unresolvable conflict with the American Constitution’s promise of representative self-government with the sole legitimate purpose of securing our natural rights.

Why do natural rights matter? Because, like the description of humankind as male and female, they truthfully reflect and befit human nature and our ordered cosmos. To attempt to sidestep the truths they reflect is to war against human nature itself, like LGBT ideology. To do that makes people unhappy, no matter how much soma you hand out to try to make them feel otherwise.

When social conflict includes deliberately fomented sexual chaos that makes the majority incapable of living a coherent and self-governing life, you don’t have a country any more, you have an asylum. The more people feel as if they are living in an asylum, the less they will commit to ensuring its continued existence.

“Accommodation” of LGBT demands has already made religious and science-believing Americans second-class citizens. Passing any federal sexual orientation and gender preference law like the Equality Act would only increase legal discrimination in the United States against those who maintain centuries-old religious traditions.

I recently discussed with a long-time military officer who worked for years at the Pentagon the new U.S. military and intelligence agency ads promoting extremist identity politics. He told me it’s now difficult for Christians to be promoted even to low-ranking officer positions due to their religious and scientific commitments about what male and female are. Making a generalship is now completely out of the question. Last week’s ousting of Lt. Col. Matthew Lohmeier over his opposition to Marxism — an official U.S. government position! — only accents this reality.

In other words, because of its support for LGBT ideology, the U.S. military de facto discriminates against Christians. This is an open secret in the ranks. It’s not any kind of secret if you, like I, have occasionally read military press materials in the past decade. The U.S. military expends huge amounts of taxpayer resources to affirm and promote destructive identity politics. Making taxpayers pay for transgender treatments is only the tip of this existential threat to our nation that prioritizes PR over effectiveness and politicizes the military.

This same institution of glass ceilings and “don’t ask don’t tell” policies for Christians in the military is rapidly rolling out across other sectors of public life. If Democrats’ policies and cultural norms expand, Christian health professionals will also face systemic institutionalized discrimination. Christian educators and students already do. The end of creating and amplifying “protected classes” is government-enforced social Balkanization. I shouldn’t have to point out how deeply dangerous this is.

What we need is not further legalized discrimination against politically selected classes of people, but an end to legal preferences for “protected classes” altogether. Protected classes are at odds with the moral and political commitments the United States has no identity without: equality before the law, free speech, freedom of religion, freedom of conscience, free assembly, and the acknowledgment that there is a God, and He is not our government. The United States needs to scrape off these legal barnacles, and quickly, because they’re taking down a ship that carries 330 million people’s lives.

Especially in an era in which abominations like critical race theory have made the racism, sexism, and religious bigotry of identity politics fully apparent, Republicans must abandon these horrific political principles that work to dissolve the very country they desire to lead. There can be no compromise with those whose political program requires erasing American citizens’ constitutionally guaranteed rights to freely speak and freely worship.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/05/17/there-is-no-way-to-fix-the-equality-act-its-identity-politics-or-equality-before-the-law-and-republicans-must-choose/,2021-05-17
Transgender Activists Do Not Want You To Hear Of 'Transition' Regret,"CBS’s “60 Minutes” aired a segment Sunday night interviewing a number of individuals who, after undergoing hormone treatments and sex “reassignment” surgeries, decided to “detransition” back to their natural sex. Despite “60 Minutes” framing the story around transgender health-care access and critiquing a number of recent bills introduced at the state level to protect minors from experimental treatments, LGBTQ activists denounced CBS’s reporting as “ridiculous” “fearmongering.”

CBS correspondent Lesley Stahl interviewed individuals who all fully “transitioned” to the opposite gender, then “destransitioned” when they realized they still felt “incomplete,” or more depressed after they “transitioned” than before. They told Stahl they felt they were “blindly affirmed.”

Grace Lidinsky-Smith, who decided to transition in her early 20s, explained how she quickly and easily started testosterone treatments after just a couple of sessions with an online therapist. “I can’t believe I transitioned then detransitioned, including hormones and surgery, in the course of like, less than one year,” she said.

60 Minutes highlights transgender people who have decided to de-transition and I’m sure it won’t be seen as controversial in the least. pic.twitter.com/vetbQFe3Oo — Jason Rantz on KTTH Radio (@jasonrantz) May 24, 2021

Stahl spoke with a youth gender psychologist who admitted her colleagues are afraid to speak up about the short timeline in which minors are able to undergo treatment “because we are afraid of not being seen as affirming … or doing something to hurt the trans community.”

Indeed, that’s exactly how these stories of “blindly affirming” trans youth are treated by the LGBTQ movement. Compelling stories of people struggling with gender identity are too dangerous to be told, according to many LGBTQ activists, because they undermine the narrative that a person’s desire to “transition” should never be questioned.

GLAAD, which bills itself as “a protest against defamatory coverage of LGBT people,” immediately lashed out at “60 Minutes” on Twitter after the segment aired. The organization called the reporting “shameful” and claimed, “the majority of the story was devoted to ‘raising concerns’ about youth access that care.”

As the piece noted, every major medical association supports affirming, age-appropriate care for trans youth and the guidelines for that care are safe and well-established. And yet, the majority of the story was devoted to ""raising concerns"" about youth accessing that care. (2/7) — GLAAD (@glaad) May 24, 2021

Yes, the majority of the story was devoted to “raising concerns,” but not about preventing youth access to gender therapy. Producers were more than generous with the air time given to transgender activists who are concerned that state legislation could block minors from testosterone, estrogen, or undergoing the knife.

The very first interview, and featured throughout the segment, is with Erica Anderson, a transgender woman and gender psychologist Stahl labels as “highly respected.” Stahl leads the segment with letting Anderson establish that anyone fighting to protect minors from experimental treatment is “demonstrating their ignorance and prejudice.”

Furthermore, CBS anticipated such virulent pushback from the transgender community for even acknowledging the existence of people who “detransition” that they posted a story about their story on their website called, “Inside the 60 Minutes report on transgender health care issues.” In it, CBS attempts to appease activists by reiterating that they “wanted to keep it focused on health care and not make it a political story.” (Even though Stahl opens the segment stating the bill is “part of a new culture war.”)

In their story on their story, they even share the transgender activists’ anticipated talking points on how “dangerous” hearing stories of “detransition” could be. The report reads:

Alphonso David, an advocate for the transgender community, a LGBTQ civil rights lawyer, and the president of the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), told Stahl in an interview that he was concerned that reporting on those who choose to detransition could be ‘taken out of context [and] could further victimize and marginalize’ the transgender community.

Even with all the preemptive hand-wringing and caveats, “60 Minutes” could not prevent the pushback. GLAAD claimed reporting on this dramatic influence of internet culture on minors “wrongfully implied that trans YouTubers and online communities which affirm trans youth are somehow brainwashing kids and turning them trans.”

Chase Strangio, a deputy director at the American Civil Liberties Union who is also transgender, blasted “60 Minutes” for “overemphasizing the exceedingly tiny percentage of people who had access to care and regret it.”

And this Network and program chose to run a story that is part of the anti-trans playbook overemphasizing the exceedingly tiny percentage of people who had access to care and regret it. Like the “abortion regret” stories, this is the weaponization of personal pain to hurt others. — Chase Strangio (@chasestrangio) May 24, 2021

One activist even questioned the legitimacy of the “detransitoner” stories because “60 Minutes” would not tell him how they found the individuals.

When I spoke with @60Minutes about their “detransition” story and asked where they found the people to profile – they refused to tell me and became defensive. We still don’t know if they searched for people on TERF forums, and transparency would be appreciated. — Jack Turban MD 🏳️‍⚧️🧠🏳️‍🌈🩺 (@jack_turban) May 25, 2021

There is a reason the transgender movement unleashed such immediate and intense pushback for even a mild attempt at highlighting instances of disappointment and regret, and it’s because these stories are true. If “detransitioning” wasn’t a growing trend and did not undermine so much of the transgender movement’s message, then by their own logic, they would let them “live their truth.” Maybe even add another letter to the LGBTQQIP2SAA community that supposedly affirms all non-traditional patterns of sexuality and gender.

“Detransition” testimonies expose what so many parents suspect, but are too afraid to say – that maybe they shouldn’t allow their teen to chemically or physically castrate themselves at the first sign of confusion. As this issue enters more statehouses across the country, we need more journalists digging into what happens when we “blindly affirm” minors. These stories are not “dangerous” or “fearmongering,” they are crucial.

Hide Your Kids: 'Blue's Clues' Is Trans-Propagandizing Preschoolers,"If your approach to parenting in our post-sexual revolution hellscape isn’t what Antoine Dodson famously called for, you need to wake up, because they raping everybody out here.

A clip of a “Blue’s Clues” song celebrating Masturbation and Genital Amputation Month went viral over the weekend heading into June.

Words cannot describe how happy this makes me. Blue’s Clues was my favorite as a kid, and I cannot believe that it would continue to be important to me as an adult. “And P is full of Pride!”

pic.twitter.com/8RlUZmq8E3 — Clark (@clarksided) May 29, 2021

“Blue’s Clues” also released an episode in May celebrating LGBT identification.

“Blue’s Clues” is a long-running preschool TV show that has played on Nickelodeon Jr. since 1996. “Blue’s Clues became the highest-rated show for preschoolers on American commercial television and was critical to Nickelodeon’s growth,” Wikipedia says. The lyrics of its “Pride Month” song, which appears to be sung by a cartoon drag queen, include the following:

“This family has two mommies, they love each other so proudly.”

“This family has two daddies, they love each other so proudly.”

“These babas are nonbinary, they love each other so proudly.”

“Trans members of this family all love each other so proudly.”

“Some people choose their family, they love each other so proudly.”

“Ace, bi, and pan grownups, you see, can love each other so proudly.”

“All families are made differently, they love each other so proudly.”

This is clearly intended to catechize small children into false and damaging beliefs about the human person. Slogan repetition is a basic propaganda technique. So is incorporating radical ideas into non-threatening and cheerful contexts.

Neither of these is accidental on “Blue’s Clues.” “Sesame Street” is well-known as a pioneer in children’s educational television, using psychological and behavioral research to inform its structure and content. It has been so successful that research actually finds that kids learn as much from “Sesame Street” as from attending preschool, on average (that’s partially because most preschool is a low-quality life experience).

“Blue’s Clues’s” creators studied and built on “Sesame Street” and subsequent early childhood research. Articles about the show’s use of children’s psychology note that “Blue’s Clues” has been designed to use repetition to focus children’s attention on learning the content the show presents.

A 2018 New York Times article points out that the highly popular show for two- to five-year-olds is so dedicated to repetition to impress its messages on children that each episode of “Blue’s Clues” plays every day for an entire week. The producers also test each episode three times on focus groups of children before it airs.

The 2005 cover story for the Association for Psychological Science’s publication Observer discusses the psychological techniques preschool shows use to impress what they believe are socially beneficial attitudes on viewers. Verbal repetition is one. Repetition throughout a child’s environment — merchandizing a show’s characters to meatspace products like classroom math exercises or Tickle Me Elmo dolls — is another.

This repetition and saturation strategy has clearly been deliberately used to normalize certain sexual behaviors and attitudes, both in children and adults. We’ve recently seen everything from a cross-dresser on “Sesame Street” to a gay wedding on PBS’s children’s show “Arthur.” LGBT consciousness is so pervasive that Americans think six times as many people are LGBT as actually identify so, and each successive generation exhibits higher rates of LGBT identification.

The problem is that these sexual behaviors and attitudes are not normal. They are dangerous.

In the first place, the only thing that sets LGBT people apart from others is their sexual behavior. Therefore, to talk about the “LGBT community” with preschoolers is to talk about sex. And not “sex” as in age-appropriate basic human biology — men have certain body parts, women have others, and together those parts can make babies — but R-rated sexual techniques like anal sex, oral sex, and masturbation.

If you think any such things are appropriate for discussion with a three-year-old, please let me know so I can make sure you never get near my children.

It is well-proven by both research and common sense that exposure to detailed sexual information harms pre-pubescent children. It is obvious by the very fact that their bodies have not made themselves ready for sexual activity yet that this is not the right age for such information. Early sexual exposure is therefore not surprisingly linked with self-harming and risky behaviors such as early sexual activity, susceptibility to sexual predators, and porn addictions.

Pornography also drives extreme sexual behaviors like BDSM and transgenderism. It’s therefore no surprise that accustoming children (and adults) to our pornified culture, as all mass media like Snapchat now engage in routinely, results in earlier and weirder sexual behaviors becoming increasingly common.

Sexual acts, of course, are the final step of all this conditioning. Making children more sexually available to adults is a long process that starts with something that seems innocuous, like celebrating transgender and “nonbinary” “families” in the name of “love” while insisting people ignore that this kind of “love” involves sterilization, increased risk of heart attacks, higher risks of suicide, and genital amputation — as well as manufacturing the children for these “chosen families” in labs and with surrogates because these “families” can only reproduce through unnatural means.

In other words, this “Blue’s Clues” material is grooming, plain and simple. It is training children to be comfortable with things they should be uncomfortable with and remain unexposed to until puberty and following, for their own well-being. To allege otherwise is gaslighting.

Further evidence of this is the transgender activist response to a recent “60 Minutes” story highlighting numerous young people who regret experimenting with transgenderism, including irreversibly damaging themselves through hormones and surgery. These young people testified that media grooming of their psyches was a key component of being rushed into a devastating medical decision.

Such widely available testimony from many, many transgender regretters is further reinforced by an explosive 2018 Brown University study by a feminist researcher. It found strong evidence that social media grooming is a key component in fomenting and hardening youth gender dysphoria. That study concluded this grooming helps fuel the current transgender “social contagion.”

Transgender activists nevertheless insist that people set aside this kind of evidence, as well as plain common sense, to believe that psychological conditioning through media such as TV programming doesn’t affect children the way psychologists affirm in other contexts that they work to ensure it absolutely does.

The segment also wrongfully implied that trans YouTubers and online communities which affirm trans youth are somehow brainwashing kids and turning them trans. That is dangerous and at the same time ridiculous. Aren't we past arguing that media can turn people gay or trans? (3/7) — GLAAD (@glaad) May 24, 2021

Transgender activists’ claim that nobody is manipulating children’s feelings about sexuality is obviously a lie. They are the very people pushing earlier sexual initiation and saturation while telling us we’re bigots if we notice.

This is the behavior of a sexual predator. What should we do with sexual predators? At the very, very least, every single parent should take Antoine Dodson’s advice: Hide your kids, hide your wife, because they’re pushing sexual contact on preschoolers out here.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/06/01/hide-your-kids-hide-your-wife-blues-clues-is-trans-propagandizing-preschoolers/,2021-06-01
U.S. Air-Force Base In Ohio Pushing Leftist Propaganda As ‘Diversity’,"The Wright-Patterson Air Force Base outside of Dayton, Ohio is using its “Diversity and Inclusion Newsletter” to push leftist propaganda on its members and the civilians who contract with the base.

Despite the U.S. military’s pledge to be non-partisan, the Wright-Patterson propaganda newsletters first began last year, shortly after the death of George Floyd, and have been consistently delivered into the inboxes of hundreds of people affiliated with the air force base. In the first 2021 quarter edition obtained by The Federalist, the base’s diversity and inclusion executive board praised President Joe Biden for reinstating critical race theory in federal agency training.

“The recension of Executive Order 13950 brings renewed promise and excitement for the Training subcommittee,” the newsletter states. “They can now forge ahead with offering training for leaders and the whole PK workforce. Training, lectures, and seminars on workplace culture; racial and gender equality; equity in leadership, and flexibility in the workplace all designed to continue to educate and challenge us!”

The Diversity and Inclusion Council also urged more participation from those reading the memo, because “diversity is the one thing we all have in common, let’s take the time to connect, embrace and celebrate!”

The six-page document also featured columns highlighting and lauding the new administration’s cabinet picks and other Democrats such as Vice President Kamala Harris, new Georgia Democrat Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, and even failed gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who is known for being a Democrat operative focused on pushing progressive talking points, lying about the GOP, and boosting leftist politicians. The bottom sections of the document encouraged readers to lean into local black history with links to multiple diversity and Black History Month resources.

The second and most recent 2021 quarter edition obtained by The Federalist takes the identity rhetoric one step farther by using buzzwords such as “equity” and brushing off concerns about “wokeness” to push LGBTQ talking points.

“Don’t think being an Ally or being ‘woke’ forces you to give up anything,” the eight-page newsletter states. “Actually actively participating and advocating for inclusivity is the act of improving everything.”

The authors of the newsletter also brought attention to a recent survey showing that the service branch needed to improve its awareness about “climate and equity issues in many areas.”

This particular edition of the mid-year newsletter hones in on “sexual diversity,” choosing to use the month of June to promote “LGBTQ rights.”

“What Are Personal Pronouns and Why Do They Matter?” one of the column headlines reads. A subsequent column instructs readers on “How to use Pronouns” in their email signatures to make a “great move toward inclusivity.”

“When a cisgender person (personal and gender identity match with birth sex) specifies their pronouns, it normalizes it. By normalizing it, it allows trans and nonbinary to feel comfortable sharing their own,” the newsletter states. “Considering to most cisgender people these are just words we use unthinkingly, but a sign of respect and recognition to trans and nonbinary people, it can’t hurt to start using them to help validate their inclusion in our workforce.”

The next page of the newsletter is devoted entirely to promoting and celebrating “Pride Month.”

“Pride Month is so important because it marks the start of huge change within the LGBTQ community, as well as the wider societal implications,” the newsletter states. “Although attitudes and injustice remain, we have come a long way since the riots of 1969 and by continuing in this long-standing tradition, we continue to raise awareness, improve the attitudes of society and encourage inclusiveness.”

Wright-Patterson did not respond to a request for comment.

The newsletters aren’t the only partisan, propaganda-like content the Air Force appears to be promoting. Plastered all over multiple U.S. Air Force webpages are videos, opinion editorials, and even resources advancing a leftist definition of “diversity. One video claims that race-focused diversity, inclusion, and equity programming are required to make people feel like they are “being invited to,” “attending,” and “being asked to dance at the party.”

The Air Force is not the only U.S. military branch that has come under fire for becoming “identity-obsessed” and pushing political agendas. Just last month, the U.S. Army released a new recruiting ad featuring a female corporal who joined the Army after being raised by “two moms” and growing up advocating for the LGBTQ agenda.

A couple of weeks later, a U.S. Space Force special unit commander was fired after he discussed the infiltration of Marxist ideology into the U.S. military on a podcast. In the recording, Lt Col. Matthew Lohmeier is heard expressing his concerns that the U.S. military enacts policies that appeal to leftists over other ideologies or parties. He specifically noted that race-driven curricula and other far-left campaigns in the military are hurting opportunities for unity.

"If Corporate Cared About Gay People, They'd Push Pride On Tehran","Alireza Fazeli Monfared was 20 years old when his family beheaded him last month.

The social media influencer was just days away from escaping his home in Iran, where homosexuality is a death sentence, to live his dream as a free gay man in the West, only for it to be crushed by the fatal blow of Iranian homophobia.

“Pressure means not being able to behave however you want in society,” Monfared said to a friend in a voice recording sent to Insider as he made plans to escape for a new life in Europe.

When Monfared’s half-brother found the influencer’s paperwork detailing the soon-asylum-seeker’s exemption from the Iranian military, which allows homosexuals to forgo mandatory service, however, relatives in a remote village beheaded Monfared in what an Iranian human rights group declared an “honor killing.”

Monfared’s story is not unique to Iran. According to Human Dignity Trust, a U.K.-based global nonprofit dedicated to LGBT rights, homosexuality remains a crime in 70 countries worldwide plus Palestine. At least 11 jurisdictions warrant homosexuality worthy of the death penalty.

As millions of LGBT people face severe persecution abroad, however, millions in the Western world are celebrating June as Pride Month, complete — as usual — with carnival-style parades and massive parties in a sign of cultural acceptance. While most parades, which require extensive preparation, had already been canceled before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its guidelines, the parties will return along with corporate activism capitalizing on the cause.

Increasingly, Western companies ring in the first of June each year with a logo change adopting the rainbow colors of the pride flag in a form of passive progressivism signaling some form of commitment to the pursuit of gay rights.

https://twitter.com/BCinKW/status/1399828905226391558?s=20

Nothing has exposed the ensuing logo changes as performative activism like their absence on corporate pages advertising to the Middle East, where nearly every country imposes criminal penalties on homosexuality.

Mercedes-Benz will proudly signal its pride on its primary Twitter page, but on the account “Mercedes-Benz Middle East,” it appears the corporation’s pride evaporates quickly.

"Corporate Pride Pushes The End Of The Constitution, Not Inclusion","It’s that time of year, when it seems like nearly every corporation in America decks itself out in more rainbows than a summer sky after a thunderstorm. But these elaborate displays of virtue signaling — limited, of course, to countries where LGBT people are already largely accepted and not countries like Iran where they are harmed — aren’t just about celebrating inclusion.

Behind the confetti-sprinkled ads with sayings so cliché (a) they hardly mean anything and (b) no one really disagrees with them, hundreds of corporations are throwing their support behind the deceptively named “Equality Act” — and its threats to religious liberties and free speech.

The marketing branches of these corporations pretend the Equality Act would simply recognize that people in the LGBT community have the same human rights anyone else does. But in actuality, the Equality Act would strip religious liberties, freedom of speech, parental rights, and the safety and privacy of women and girls.

The bill explicitly exempts itself from the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which Congress passed to secure religious exemptions on issues like this one. It would open women’s prisons to men, even men with no surgical changes, and force women’s sports programs and bathrooms to welcome biological males.

Under the Equality Act, employers couldn’t prevent biological men identifying as women from taking jobs like “law enforcement officials involved in strip searches or supervisors of locker rooms, or handling intimate care in hospitals or long-term care facility,” as Margot Cleveland noted for The Federalist. It could also penalize parents who don’t wholeheartedly endorse their children’s desires to identify as the opposite sex; it would ban “conversion therapy,” which the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) broadly defines as “any attempt to change a person’s sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.”

With those extreme provisions in mind, here’s a roundup of some of the major corporations doing backflips to support the Equality Act.

1. Target

Target launched a collection of more than 150 pride-themed products this year, including string lights, scented candles, and this $50 garishly striped rainbow shorts suit, which was quickly mocked on Twitter. Behind its colorful displays, Target has professed support for the Equality Act since 2015.

2. IBM

“We’re Stronger Together,” IBM declares with an overused and vague cliché. President and CEO Ginni Rometty sent a letter to Congress in 2019 “unequivocally voicing support for the Equality Act and urging lawmakers to pass it without delay.”

3. Honda

The American branch of the vehicle company explicitly posted its support for the Equality Act on June 1, also sharing a post from the Human Rights Campaign, one of the chief activist groups pushing the legislation. To them, like all the rest of these corporate entities, support for LGBT Americans is synonymous with ending constitutional protections for free speech and living in accord with your conscience.

4. Capital One

For Pride Month, Capital One posted a video complete with upbeat music, stock video clips of smiling people, and the buzzwords “equality” “love” and “family.” The banking company also pledged “strong support” for the Equality Act, with a press release assuring “Capital One is proud to be advocating for its passage.”

5. Gap, Inc.

Equality is “always in style,” said Gap in its 2016 announcement of support for the Equality Act. This year, the retailer — which is also connected to Banana Republic and Old Navy — announced a Pride clothing collection and a $50,000 donation to GLAAD.

8. American Airlines

American Airlines decked its Twitter profile and cover photos in rainbow stripes, along with a separate Twitter post for Pride Month. It’s also advertising a list of 23 onboard “movies to celebrate Pride,” while touting its “active advocacy” for the Equality Act.

9. Disney

The Walt Disney Co., whose core products are geared toward children, is part of the HRC’s Business Coalition in favor of the Equality Act. It also offers a Pride collection for sale, including a baby onesie and rainbow stuffed Mickey and Minnie toys.

Disney Plus, the entertainment giant’s online streaming site, is also spotlighting TV shows and films that encourage children to question their sexuality.

NYC Pride To LGBT Cops: You’re Not Welcome At Our Parade,"Like a bullied kid befriending his tormentor, the NYPD continues to appease Heritage of Pride (NYC Pride). The department thanked all LGBT folks for their “inspiring drive towards equality” — despite NYC Pride recently announcing it would not allow uniformed officers to participate in any events until 2025 at the earliest.

As NYPD thanked Pride NYC for its bravery and courage, Twitter respondents accused officers of brutality against LGBT people and called for police defunding.

NYC Pride issued a statement in May that it will “take steps to keep police officers at least one city block away from event perimeter areas where possible. Although NYC Pride has no legal authority to prohibit officers from performing law enforcement duties, the group is attempting to minimize NYPD’s presence by replacing the department’s officers with private security and community volunteers.

“NYPD will provide first response and security only when absolutely necessary as mandated by city officials,” the group said, citing undefined “excessive force” and “violence against marginalized groups” as a reason for the ban.

Supporters reacted enthusiastically to the May announcement, saying cops “should not be here,” a sentiment that contradicts the Pride movement’s purported pushes for inclusivity.

Along with taking steps to lessen police presence for security, NYC Pride banned any LGBT officers from participating in events while in uniform. The Gay Officers Action League (GOAL), which prides itself on its work to enact “police reform and policy revision touching on the LGBTQIA+ community in New York City,” will not be allowed to attend the parade to show its support. GOAL typically marches in an effort to bridge relations between law enforcement and LGBT folks.

GOAL said it was “disheartened” by the news of the police ban. “Heritage of Pride (NYC Pride) has long been a valued partner of our organization and its abrupt about-face in order to placate some of the activists in our community is shameful,” GOAL said in a statement.

Ravi Satkalmi, a gay police officer, wrote an opinion for the New York Daily News about his disappointment in an organization that had promised acceptance and inclusion. “The move makes absolutely clear that one has to choose between being gay or being in law enforcement, recreating for queer officers the unconscionable conundrum that we have fought decades to banish,” the officer wrote. “For a new gay officer or recruit who is struggling with whether to come out, the message is unmistakable: The LGBTQIA+ community will not support you.”

While the NYPD has criticized NYC Pride for trying to ban it from events and still plans to fulfill its law enforcement duties, the attempted exclusion isn’t stopping the police department from celebrating Pride month.

The NYPD’s “Happy #Pride” tweet raises quite a cultural question: How can Pride be congratulated for its “drive towards equality” despite banning an entire group of people based on what they do for a living?

Biden’s DOJ Threatens To Abandon Protections For Religious Colleges,"The Biden Department of Justice briefly instigated outrage from progressives recently when it filed a routine legal brief promising to defend Title IX’s statutory exemption for religious colleges. The DOJ filed the brief to fend off efforts by religious colleges, some of whom are represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, to intervene in a lawsuit brought by 40 past and present LGBT college students who claim the exemption violates the U.S. Constitution.

The exemption safeguards the ability of religious colleges that receive federal funds to maintain faith-based polices governing such things as student sexual conduct and sex-specific student housing. The DOJ wrote in its brief that it shared the proposed intervenors’ “ultimate objective…to defend the statutory exemption and its current application.”

Reaction from the left was swift and apoplectic. Speaking with The Washington Post, the students’ lawyer accused the DOJ of “aligning itself with anti-LGBTQ hate” and complained that the DOJ’s position “will make our case harder if the federal government plans to vigorously defend” the exemption.

Writing for The New Republic, Melissa Gira Grant proclaimed, “the Biden administration is now facing serious doubts about how far it is willing to go in the fight for LGBTQ rights.” Slate writer Mark Joseph Stern mused that while “Biden’s progressive supporters may be offended by the DOJ’s defense of discrimination,” the alternative—allowing religious colleges to intervene and defend their rights—“is almost certainly worse.”

Stunned by this sudden revolt, the DOJ quickly backpedaled. The day after the filing, the DOJ amended its brief, eliminating any mention of shared objectives, dropping its commitment to defend the “current application” of the exemption to religious colleges, and casually noting that the religious colleges could always seek intervention later “if it transpires” that the DOJ is “not fully defending” the exemption as applied them.

Amid this tour de force in obfuscation, the DOJ made one thing clear: the Department of Education is reviewing its Title IX regulations to ensure their consistency with the Biden administration’s “policy on guaranteeing an educational environment free from discrimination on the basis of sex.” Also, “until that process is complete,” the DOJ noted, “it would be premature to conclude that the government is an inadequate representative.”

Premature? Hardly. Since its inception, the Biden administration has woven a far-left agenda into the fabric of federal civil rights laws, including Title IX. In Executive Order 13,988, issued on his first day in office, President Biden announced that Title IX and its implementing regulations must be read to ensure that children have access to locker rooms, restrooms, and school sports consistent with their gender identity, not their biological sex.

Echoing that order, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Pam Karlan of the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division—the division charged with coordinating the enforcement and application of Title IX by executive agencies—concluded that, in light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, Title IX now applies to gender identity and sexual orientation, even though Congress has persistently rejected numerous attempts to amend the statute to do that very thing.

And now, in the face of these sweeping changes to civil rights laws and bowing to left-wing pressure, the DOJ will not even commit to defending Title IX’s statutory religious exemption as applied to religious colleges. Progressive writers have urged that “figuring out where Biden stands on religious exemptions and LGBTQ rights is critical right now.” The DOJ has now given them an answer.

But before embracing that path, the DOJ should consider that making war on religious exemptions in the name of LGBT rights represents a false choice, born of an intolerant ideology.

Religious exemptions under U.S. law are as old as our nation. Protecting religious organizations has long yielded substantial societal benefits—from feeding the hungry, to housing the homeless, to caring for the environment, to assisting struggling children and families, to educating our nation’s young. Exemptions are the product of an American culture that embraces freedom, diversity, and true tolerance.

Exemptions also reflect the Free Exercise and Establishment Clause protections enshrined in the First Amendment: The government cannot be in the business of telling religious organizations how they must act, who they must hire, and what they should believe.

Consistent with those principles, the Supreme Court has “allowed legislative accommodations for religious activity and upheld legislatively granted religious exemptions from generally applicable laws.” The high court “likewise has upheld government benefits and tax exemptions that go to religious organizations, even when those policies have the effect of advancing or endorsing religion.” The message from the Supreme Court is clear: Religious persons and organizations occupy a vital place at the center of the public life of our nation.

The court has echoed this theme even when striking down state laws prohibiting same-sex marriage and writing sexual orientation and gender identity into Title VII. In Obergefell v. Hodges, Justice Anthony Kennedy emphasized that religious persons “may continue to advocate with utmost, sincere convictions that, by divine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be condoned,” and that “religious organizations and persons are given proper protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths.”

In Bostock v. Clayton County, in response to those who feared the decision would force religious employers to violate their conscience, Justice Neil Gorsuch offered reassurance: “We are also deeply concerned with preserving the promise of the free exercise of religion enshrined in our Constitution; that guarantee lies at the heart of our pluralistic society.”

This abiding commitment to a free and pluralistic society is not shared by the leftist commissars who increasingly hold power in our nation’s public institutions. Take the example of Tanner Cross.

Tanner teaches at Leesburg Elementary School in Virginia’s Loudoun County Public School District. Upon hearing that the school board was considering a new policy that would require all teachers to use pronouns that reflect people’s gender identity, not sex, Tanner decided to speak up.

Citing medical evidence, he shared his belief that affirming gender confusion harms children, and his faith precludes him from telling lies. He respectfully shared those beliefs with the board on his own time—after the board invited public comment. For that, the board suspended Tanner and banished him from school grounds.

Thankfully, Alliance Defending Freedom filed suit on Tanner’s behalf, and the court ordered him reinstated. But Tanner’s ordeal is emblematic of an alarming trend.

Those in power—particularly those seeking to advance “social justice” and implement “critical theories”—brook no dissent, tolerate no diversity of thought, and give no quarter to their ideological opponents. That totalitarian impulse contradicts our nation’s foundational commitment to freedom of conscience, thought, and speech. It is fundamentally un-American.

That impulse cannot be allowed to trample accommodations and exemptions for religious persons and organizations that enable them to participate fully in the public square. The Biden administration and its DOJ should uphold the law, not ignore and rewrite it. And they must reject the disingenuous invitation of radical leftists to pit faith against freedom.

"New Jersey High School Pushes Pride Month Celebrations, LGBT Books On Students","Recent social media posts from Delsea Regional High School, a government school in Franklinville, New Jersey, revealed that the school was celebrating pride month by pushing students to take a variety of actions to signal their support for the LGBT movement.

In a TikTok video posted by @myteacherface, a number of different ways that the school is celebrating pride month. The video begins with an activities list for the Week of June 7th, which includes a direction to “Sign the ally banner in the front lobby.”

Students were also encouraged to wear a pride ribbon, the colors of the rainbow, a pride lanyard and mask, and a t-shirt that was sold by the Equity Committee and the Gay-Straight Alliance according to a Facebook post.

Staff members are shown celebrating pride month at the school, with some standing in front of the “proud ally” banner and another standing in front of a modified pride flag that includes a design from the transgender flag. To the left of the flag are smaller flags that represent bisexuals, lesbians, pansexuals, asexuals, and others.

Delsea Regional High School’s library also promoted several pro-LGBT books on their website under the category “New reads in the media center,” including one book entitled “Beyond the Gender Binary,” and another called “Rainbow Revolutionaries.” The library also highlighted a book entitled “Felix Ever After,” about an individual who is “black, queer, and transgender” who “comes up with a plan for revenge” after he finds that an anonymous student was “publicly posting Felix’s deadname alongside images of him before he transitioned.”

Delsea Regional High School’s library also advertised a book called “High Five for Glenn Burke,” which focuses on “sixth grader Silas Walker” as he takes “his own first baby step to coming out as gay.”",https://thefederalist.com/2021/06/14/new-jersey-high-school-pushes-pride-month-celebrations-lgbt-books-on-students/,2021-06-14
Why Do Parents Think Prepubescent Sexual Grooming Is Pro-LGBT?,"Desmond Napoles emerges from behind the curtain onto the red carpet catwalk stretched between crowds of onlooking adults who hoot and holler as the entertainer swirls pink-tinged hair and hips seductively. Desmond is an 11-year-old boy. His parents smile approvingly from the front row of the “Good Morning America” set.

“I’m very proud of him. I’m proud that he’s found his path so early,” says the father of the boy, who is known by his drag queen stage name Desmond is Amazing, in an interview for the 2018 segment. “My greatest joy in this is just seeing Desmond happy,” his mother adds.

The juvenile star plops down on a chair in front of the studio audience, and the hosts surprise him with secret drag queen guests, who shower the child with gifts and praise for being “inspirational,” “brave,” and “courageous.”

Thanks to the help of his parents and our LGBT-obsessed culture, Desmond, who is now a young teen, has amassed quite the following and market, with more than 160,000 followers on Instagram, Pride merchandise, media hits, and magazine photoshoots, and now even a book and an original song debuted in April called “We Are Amazing.”

“If you can just let go of that, and just love your child unconditionally as you should, no matter what … there really isn’t a problem,” Desmond’s mother declared in a different television interview that year.

Contra the drag child’s mother, there is a problem, and it’s a big one. There’s nothing inspirational, brave, or courageous about a child being lauded for sexual divergence. Children are by nature shameless and imaginative in ways that make dressing up in vibrant clothing and face paint adventurous and innocent. These displays become brave and inspirational only after their parents or other adults opt to capitalize on them.

Led by children like Desmond and Jazz Jennings, whose parents are at best complicit and at worst goading, or by celebrity parents such as Dwayne Wade and Gabrielle Union who have publicly endorsed the gender confusion of their children, the sexualization of children has been accelerating for the better part of a decade. A brick of misguided approval and ignorance on the cultural gas pedal threatens to plunge the whole perverted enterprise right off a cliff.

We deserve it — because at the core of all the rainbow flag-waving and “love is love is love” sloganeering is the sick reality that any Pride activism involving children is the result of adults sexualizing them, fetishizing them, and exploiting them for political or social gain. When a parent posits that their child’s happiness is more important than their security and a drag queen heralds a kid’s gender whims as brave and inspiring, they project their perverted sexual ethics on a generation of innocents who become casualties of the culture war. Children don’t think in terms of sexuality and gender expression, meaning divergence from the biological binary isn’t a “statement” or an “identity” — until an adult decides to market it as such.

The body count is increasing, which is why a 2018 Desmond segment is so relevant today. It’s instructive about how adults have propelled this issue. If it isn’t Blues Clues forcing gender dogma down the throats of pre-schoolers in the form of an animated drag queen co-opting a familiar tune for a messed-up Pride parade song, it’s a real-life drag queen rapping about the colors of the rainbow flag for the kids on Nickelodeon.

Last month, a TikToker proudly posted a video of adults in New York City encouraging a little girl to twerk and cheering as the tiny child gyrated for their amusement. This is to say nothing of the adults who celebrate the genital mutilation and sterilization of kids.

Same-sex couples began adopting and commissioning the artificial production of kids without regard for children’s parenting needs, drag queens began reading to tots in public places, Facebook fast-tracked the so-called gender lexicon, schools started referring to students by their preferred pronouns regardless of parents’ wishes, and worst of all, doctors who took the Hippocratic Oath began castrating minors. Children are paying the price for all of it.

In one New York City private school, a video shown to first-graders talked explicitly about masturbation. In the cartoon, created for five- and six-year-olds, cartoon characters talk about touching themselves “because it feels good.”

“Hey, how come my penis gets big sometimes and points up in the air?” a young boy cartoon character says in the video.“Sometimes I touch my penis because it feels good.”

“Sometimes when I’m in my bath or when mom puts me to bed, I like to touch my vulva too,” a young girl character replies.

This type of sexualized content for children, branded deceptively under “education,” is truly masturbatory for adults. In inculcating sexual curiosity in prepubescent minds, they’re really stroking their own interests and deriving pleasure from the resulting ideological stimulation of children — often against the will of their parents — which they believe serves their political and social ends.

If they can sexualize kids before their parents have a chance to instill a mature and moral sexual ethic, progressive leaders can mold them into more promiscuous adults who give a thumbs-up to scientifically untethered gender theory and approve of hedonistic policy.

Conservatives love to talk about the culture war, and for very good reason, but we shouldn’t allow the sexual exploitation of innocent children to become an imprecise political talking point under the banner of “LGBT issues.” Two consenting adults in the bedroom is an “LGBT issue.” Parents pimping out their children for entertainment and political points is a disgusting league all its own.

Aside from merely keeping their offspring alive, parents have one primary job: to instill truth in their children. Up is up and down is down, 1+1=2, boys and girls are different — and eventually, boys and girls are marvelous sexual beings who reproduce for human flourishing.

Too many modern parents have left this job of instilling truth to schools and peers, and it’s creating a generation of sexualized children raised by amoral educators who scoff at traditional values and morality and affirm minors who agree to parrot the left’s preferred political ideology. It isn’t enough for parents not to sexualize their children. In not actively fighting against the exploitation of our youth, we become complicit in it and therefore grant approval and legitimacy.

In Romans 1, Paul warns Christians against a litany of sexual sins, including same-sex gratification. He says, “And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.” In the list of transgressions, he includes “inventors of evil” and goes on to say: “Though they know God’s righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.”

Don’t give approval to those who invent sexually debased content that seeks to consume our children by becoming numb to it. Actively fight against it, lest we be destroyed — as a country that pimps out its own children for entertainment and political points deserves to be.

'Pride Month' Is Now An Industry Targeting Children As Young As 3,"You probably haven’t read a comic book in a few years, but if you have, particularly if you have over the past two weeks, you might have noticed a lot less Batman and Joker, and a whole lot more rainbows and gender fluidity.

DC Comics, home of the Caped Crusader, is advertising LGBT Pride T-shirts for Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, and even the Joker’s girlfriend. They just released an anthology, “DC Pride,” that celebrates all the L-G-B-T-Q-I-A-and-on-and-on people apparently in the DC Comics Universe.

Did you know Aqualad, the black younger sidekick of Aquaman you’ve never heard of until now, is gay? Did you know that in addition to liking mass murder, Batman’s Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn also like other women? It used to be superpowers that united comic book characters from the lamest to the most successful; now, what unites all these heroes is apparently just their sexuality.

Not to be left out, Marvel’s Loki is now genderfluid. “I know how many people identify with Loki in particular and are eager for that representation,” the head writer claims, “especially with this character. We worked really hard.”

Some might think, “How quaint. The picture books are making adults angry again, just like in the 1950s.” That doesn’t matter, though: Shoving sexualized propaganda in products aimed at children aged 8-10 isn’t edgy, isn’t cool, and isn’t brave — it’s gross, and if you don’t realize this by looking at comic books, take a look at how all our major corporations have behaved during the Month of Pride, previously known as “June.”

Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Cisco Systems, Lenovo, Capital One: All of them have a custom Pride logo. Sure, those are grown-up firms, but there’s also kids’ video game company Bethesda, the NFL, the D.C. United soccer club, Coca-Cola, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok. It’s wild to see so many multinational corporations that are all so brave and so daring. Of course, just in case you were wondering if this was about principles or pandering, none of those companies changed their logos in China, or in the Middle East.

It’s one thing to join the mob for profits, but this year in particular we’re seeing another side of Pride month: The side that isn’t simply about making money and joining in a popular fad; the side that is very, very interested in your children.

This month, “Blue’s Clues” put out a three and a half minute video of a cartoon Pride parade. It features two “non-binary” dolphins, asexual animals, pansexual animals, and a transgender beaver. Remember: This show is aimed at three- to five-year olds.

Children’s TV is broadly a wasteland, but that doesn’t mean the public reading is safe either, and a good number of local public libraries these days are as political as a New York Times editorial meeting. A group called “No Time For Flash Cards,” for example, keeps a list of recommended LGBT books for toddlers and grade schoolers. Their 2020 edition of the list had 72 books, such as “Rainbow: A First Book of Pride,” “My Two Dads Are amazing,” and ““Phoenix Goes To School,” about a transgender child named Phoenix starting kindergarten.

Besides all the Pride books on the shelves, the library might be hosting a “Drag Queen Story Hour.” If you’re in Texas, the person reading the book might be a convicted child sex offender, like the one the Houston Public Library scheduled in 2019. If you’re in Portland, Oregon, librarians might let the children crawl on the drag queen’s body, — something the library thought was so unremarkable they put pictures of it up on Facebook.

How about public schools? Suffice it to say, if our schools cared about real science as much as they cared about sexual propaganda we’d have a Mars colony by now. In New Jersey, starting in fifth grade, the state’s public schools are required to incorporate an “LGBT-inclusive” curriculum into every subject, from history to math to Spanish class. LGBT history is mandatory in Colorado, Illinois, and California as well.

But don’t be fooled by “history” — this agenda is interested in far more than making sure your kids know who Harvey Milk was. In Oregon, Washington state, and California, doctors and social workers can take your child out of your home if they believe they aren’t being given the “gender-affirming” care they need.

Last fall in Seattle, a Muslim immigrant who worked in the tech sector was worried about his 16-year-old son, who is autistic and was struggling so badly during unending union-led school lockdowns that his parents became worried he might try to harm himself.

In a panic and at a loss, dad brought his son to Seattle Children’s Hospital to see if they could help. He wasn’t allowed to stay because of “COVID” so had to trust the doctors. It turns out he shouldn’t have. When they were finished, they told him he would be allowed to pick up his “daughter” now.

That means that doctors — medically trained and licensed doctors — used their COVID protocols to separate a child from his father, isolated that kid (who was already in severe emotional distress and who hadn’t been allowed by Seattle to be in a classroom all year), and convinced him his problem was he was a girl. If that isn’t abuse of children, of power, of state authority, what is?

But luckily for the doctors, their allies wrote the laws, so they can do this to anyone in Washington state aged 13 and older without ever requesting mom or dad’s permission.

In a recent study of 13 Pittsburgh high schools, about 10 percent of students said they were transgender or “non-binary.” Were these kids actually born with the “wrong gender”? The ’60s, ’70s, ’80s and ’90s had plenty of youth rebellion, but were 10 percent of our classmates confused about if they were a boy or a girl? No, of course not. And today, what we’re seeing is really just teenagers responding to the challenges of growing up by embracing a new ideology that is pushed on them aggressively.

This might be stupid but relatively harmless if it were merely a social behavior, but it’s not. Our medical system is providing young people will powerful hormones, sterilization, double mastectomies, and fake sex organs all in the name of “gender affirmation.” Many of these treatments are irreversible, and none of them have well-understood long-term consequences.

Meanwhile, preschool and kindergarten teachers and librarians are grooming children for this; in grade school and high school, children are being indoctrinated in it; in high school and college, mass gender reassignment is celebrated as totally normal and not at all insane; and at gender clinics, people are making money off of it.

In American society, Pride is no longer a cardinal sin — the root of all sins. In 2021, it’s an industry. Step aside, gay parade: June is now the month to celebrate this new complex.

Gender-bending is a fad, and someday this country will look back in horror at what it did to impressionable children in the name of promoting it.

Still today there are legions of wonderful, hard-working teachers, administrators and doctors who are being drowned out, undermined, isolated and alienated from their fields and from the children by a loud contingent of mentally ill activists who think other peoples’ kids are playthings for their sicknesses, and who are backed up by cowardly politicians and idiot parents. Teachers like Tanner Cross, a gym teacher in northern Virginia whose school district is fighting in court to fire him for being a Christian and refusing their gender games. People who understand that in order to hand down a Christian, Western tradition to a generation deserving of that mantle, we must first be worthy of that mantle.

While brave teachers fight inside the system, and while parents stand up to school boards and administrators across the country, private schools like St. Jerome Academy just outside of Washington, D.C. have made their classically liberal education plan available online to encourage and assist others interested in their path.

Despite what seems like our best efforts to provoke the end times, you might notice we haven’t yet been engulfed in a ball of fire, which at least means there’s still time. And across the states, there are people committed to educating children and raising them free from the designs of reassignment activists, transgender beavers, “LGBT math” and every other strange iteration of this new industry.

Education isn’t to coddle or to affirm, but to lead young people out of themselves and into the world they’ll inherit. At its Latin root, it means to “educare,” meaning to train, and “educere,” meaning to lead out, and it holds the power to lead us out of our crisis. Not everyone has forgotten this.

San Francisco Leftists Are Funding Your Library's Drag Queen Story Hour,"It’s no secret that California has long enjoyed disproportionate influence over American cultural and sexual norms, and even much of the world’s, due to its dominion over the film industry through Hollywood and its influence on the pornography industry through the San Fernando Valley, which reportedly is home to “more (porn) companies … than anywhere else.”

Another equally depraved force emanating from the Golden State has also been hard at work peddling perversity on an international scale, this time with a younger audience in mind.

Drag Queen Story Hour, the organization responsible for promoting drag queens reading to children at public libraries, likes to bill itself as a grassroots organization, writing on its website that “all DQSH events are produced locally and independently.” Upon deeper examination, however, it becomes apparent that a number of wealthy interests, almost all from California’s San Francisco Bay Area, have bankrolled the initiative.

DQSH has brought not just one, not two, but at least three convicted sex criminals, two of whom are convicted pedophiles, into confined spaces with large numbers of young children on multiple occasions. Its events also have been sponsored by a man who’s been charged with seven counts of child pornography possession. So much for the “safe space” that drag queen “Miss Terra Cotta Sugarbaker” claims the program provides.

Origin Of Drag Queen Story Hour

Before examining the financial backers of Drag Queen Story Hour, it’s vital to understand the organization’s roots. DQSH was founded in 2015 by colorful characters Michelle Tea, a lesbian (former) prostitute; Virgie Tovar, author of “You Have the Right to Remain Fat”; and Juli Delgado Lopera, who leads Drag Queen Story Hour’s parent organization, Radar Productions, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that describes itself as a “Bay Area queer literary arts organization.”

Radar Productions proudly notes that Drag Queen Story Hour “captures the imagination and play of the gender fluidity in childhood,” and says it managed Drag Queen Story Hour up until 2018, guiding it from infancy to its rise as a “global phenomenon.”

How did Drag Queen Story Hour, which now describes itself as “a global network of local organizations, each of which is independently managed and funded,” rise to international prominence in six short years, with chapters on four different continents and in 29 different states, as well as in Puerto Rico?

While a wealth of slobbering puff pieces from corporate media like Cosmopolitan, NBC, CBS, and the Daily Mail, among others, most certainly aided the growth of the pedophile-assisting nonprofit, generous donors undoubtedly drove much of the organization’s early successes.

Drag Queen Story Hour’s San Francisco Funders

The Zellerbach Family Foundation, which is perhaps better known for funding refugee resettlement programs, gave to Radar Productions in 2015, 2016, and 2018 while it was managing Drag Queen Story Hour. The foundation is based in San Francisco, where the organization’s namesake started a paper business in 1868. The Walter and Elise Haas Fund, which is also based in San Francisco, gave Radar Productions $10,000 in 2018.

The San Francisco Arts Commission, an agency of the city government, gave Radar $38,000 between 2015 and 2018, while the California Arts Council, a state agency, donated a whopping $74,040 to Radar Productions between 2015 and 2018.

The Horizons Foundation, yet another pro-LGBT organization based in San Francisco, gave Radar $24,500 from 2007 to 2012, before Drag Queen Story Hour was created, but Radar Productions still lists Horizons as a donor on its website. Furthermore, the Horizons Foundation, which is funded by PG&E, Facebook, City National Bank, and a number of other prominent corporations, advertises Drag Queen Story Hour as a program of one of its “grantee partners.”

Radar Productions also lists Poets and Writers, the Queer Cultural Center, the San Francisco Public Library, and the San Francisco Foundation as funders, although it isn’t clear whether these organizations offered monetary support while Radar managed Drag Queen Story Hour. Notice how much of DQSH’s financial backing comes from San Francisco.

Not all of these donors designated their donations for Drag Queen Story Hour. Given the fungible nature of donations, however, any funds given to Radar Productions from 2015 to 2018 at least indirectly benefited the program, much in the same way that donations to Planned Parenthood, no matter to what they’re designated, all tacitly serve the organization’s ability to provide abortions, if in no other way than by freeing up funds or labor to be reallocated.

What This Means For America — And Beyond

The process of Californication, in which California exports its culture to supplant the way of life of other states or regions, isn’t just an issue facing Idaho or Texas, two common destinations for those fleeing the Golden State. It’s an issue that threatens any community with a library and a group of parents who are sick enough to take their four-year-olds to cuddle with registered pedophiles for the sake of social brownie points or the entirely nebulous value of “tolerance.”

The culture of the Castro District is coming to a library near you, no matter if you’re in Tennessee or Tokyo, Mississippi or Malmo, Arizona or Australia. Pause to think of how incredibly dangerous it is for San Francisco, of all places, to play such an oversized role in defining our youngest generation’s understanding of sex.

This money trail makes yet another rip in the libertarian claim that LGBT issues are simply a matter of personal liberty rather than a dire struggle between traditional morality and an insurgent sexual ethic that, with the help of moneyed interests from California’s Bay Area, targets children and seeks to export itself from San Francisco to the rest of the country and beyond.

Conversely, these financial details vindicate the concerns of conservatives who frequently rail against urban, coastal elites who use their wealth and prestige to enforce their progressive orthodoxy on the rest of the country (and even on other countries) through cultural imperialism — in this case, Californication.

While the financial background of Drag Queen Story Hour is certainly intriguing, it isn’t unique, nor should it be surprising. It’s just one more chapter in the conflict between the generally Christian-derived values of Middle America and the cosmopolitan urban centers that have the money, the institutions, and the will to supplant and disrupt indigenous ethical frameworks they deem “bigoted,” whether at home or abroad.

Democrats Try to Blame LGBT Parade Death On DeSantis And Fail,"Following an automobile-related accident at a Florida LGBT parade this weekend, left-wing activists and reporters were quick to lay the blame at the feet of Gov. Ron DeSantis, referring to the incident as an act of “terrorism” against LGBT Americans before facts about the case were released to the public.

The episode occurred Saturday, when a 77-year-old man driving a white Dodge truck unexpectedly struck several pedestrians in the lead-up to the Stonewall Pride Parade in Wilton Manors, Florida. One individual was killed in the incident, while another was seriously injured.

Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis issued a statement from the scene of the crash, prematurely claiming the incident was a “terrorist attack” against LGBT Floridians.

“This is a terrorist attack against the LGBT community,” he said. “This is exactly what it is. Hardly an accident. It was deliberate, it was premeditated, and it was targeted against a specific person. Luckily they missed that person, but unfortunately, they hit two other people.”

Following an investigation by the Fort Lauderdale Police Department (FLPD), however, police later confirmed that the driver — who was a participant in the parade — had accelerated accidentally. According to CBS Miami, “Police said the driver had ailments preventing him from walking the duration of the parade, which is why he was selected to be the lead vehicle.” Officers also conducted a DUI field test, which showed no signs of impairment.

Trantalis is hardly the only Democrat to pre-emptively politicize the incident. Multiple high-profile Democrat activists and media figures wasted no time in attempting to blame the tragedy on Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, citing the governor’s recently signed anti-riot legislation as the root cause.

“Wilton Manors is what happens when you pass a bill that encourages people to run over protestors with their car,” tweeted Democrat activist Chris Hahn. “Ron DeSantis and the rest of the Florida GOP have blood on their hands. #DeathSantis.” Hahn has since deleted the tweet and issued a correction and apology.

Leftist writer Lesley Abravanel also took to Twitter, comparing the Florida governor to North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un and labeling the incident “Charlottesville part 2,” in an apparent reference to the racial violence that took place in the Virginia city in August 2017.

“2 hit by truck, 1 killed at #Prideparade in Wilton Manors narrowly missing ⁦@DWStweets,” she said. “Domestic terrorism made legal by bigot #KimJongRon #DeathSantis. Charlottesville part 2. #RemoveRon #Florida #Floriduh” Abravanel later acknowledged the incident wasn’t terrorism-related, while still referring to DeSantis as a “bigot.”

As we now know,last night’s tragic incident at the Wilton Manors #Pride parade wasn’t domestic terrorism. But the toxic environment created by the laws of a bigot like @GovRonDeSantis & the encouragement of Trump’s terror fueled Turd Reich regime & #GQP made it entirely plausible https://t.co/ltgMncEyB6 — Lesley Abravanel (@lesleyabravanel) June 20, 2021

DeSantis Press Secretary Christina Pushaw noted the media’s desire to place politics over accuracy regarding the incident.

“We as Floridians should be coming together to mourn the loss of life and pray for the recovery of those who were injured,” she told The Federalist. “But instead, a local official made premature, reckless, and inflammatory remarks that were inspired by politics, not facts. This disinformation was instantly spread in corporate media without the most basic attempts at fact-checking, because too many journalists prioritize being ‘first’ over being accurate.”

Pushaw also stated that she’s not surprised by the amplification the lie received on Twitter, arguing that “every time the hashtag ‘DeathSantis’ trends, it’s a direct result of the media lying about Governor DeSantis.”

“This shameful politicization of a tragic accident is the latest example of the media refusing to let facts get in the way of their narratives,” she said.

DeSantis was briefed on the matter Saturday night and has spoken with the local sheriff on the ground, according to Pushaw.

Refusing To Fight The Culture War Will Mean Pain For Those You Love,"In the political lexicon, a person who has been “red-pilled” — a reference to an iconic scene in the 1999 film “The Matrix” — has moved from the left to the right. At least from the right’s perspective, red-pilled people courageously shed their previous assumptions to realign from blissful ignorance to reality, often enduring significant social and professional consequences.

A related new term has emerged and quickly gained popularity on the right: “black-pilled.” While a red-pilled person typically finds conservatism unexpectedly, through a certain book or a particular professor, taking the “black pill” is fully intentional. Rather than prompting an exit from the matrix of leftist groupthink, however, taking the black pill means totally disengaging.

Black-pilled Americans have concluded politics and culture are so corrupt there’s no longer any use in trying to save them. Think of the hundreds of thousands of Republicans who stayed home during the U.S. Senate runoff elections in Georgia. Instead, they believe the only viable course of action is to pull the plug and fade to black.

This is wrongheaded. It’s cowardly and selfish, abandoning our fellow citizens to woke chaos. And it’s a surefire way to lose the republic once and for all.

Black-pilling apologists insist the storm has to pass eventually — perhaps 10, 20, or 50 years from now — so it’s better to save energy. Such an assumption is incredibly naïve.

Rather than assuming the evils of the world will retreat on their own, conservatives must proactively engage the fight. No corner can expect to escape wokeism’s ever-increasing political and cultural power if left unchecked. Not content to simply let conservatives retreat, the left is sniffing them out in their schools, jobs, and suspended social media accounts.

Take the example of leftist propaganda in public schools. Fed up with a barrage of wokeism and the diktats of self-seeking teachers’ unions, many parents over the past year have pulled their kids out of public education. In many cases, they’ve turned to homeschooling. Others have chosen private schools, religiously affiliated or otherwise.

There was recent reason to hope this would be an effective alternative to the public school’s propaganda-pushing. The Biden administration announced it would “vigorously” defend what had long been a commonly accepted position: religious schools should not be forced to contravene their theological beliefs, including those on human sexuality.

But it wasn’t enough for the left to win with an asterisk. LGBT activist Lauren Ober, for instance, described the religious exemption as “just a thinly veiled excuse for anti-LGBT hate and abuse.”

The director of the “Religious Exemption Accountability Project” declared the administration was “aligning itself with anti-LGBTQ hate in order to vigorously defend an exemption that everyone knows causes severe harm to LGBTQ students.” Meanwhile, PinkNews filed its story about the administration’s announcement under the categories “Christianity” and “homophobia.”

The left has been rapidly moving toward this point for years. In 2019, Robert “Beto” O’Rourke, once considered a leading Democrat presidential candidate, said every place of worship that defined marriage as between one biological man and one biological woman should lose its tax-exempt status. Beto was only slightly ahead of the curve. Without a doubt, there will be more presidential contenders next time around eagerly willing to take the same position.

While Biden makes empty and untrustworthy promises to religious institutions, the left will continue its crusade against people of faith like the Little Sisters of the Poor, and Christian bakers in Middle America merely using their artistic talents to provide for themselves and their families.

That a “religious exemption” is even considered controversial by coastal elites ought to alarm every American who believes our First Amendment freedoms are crucial to liberty and prosperity. It’s a very dangerous idea to let faceless administrative bureaucrats decide whether a Christian school is allowed to adhere to Christianity, an Islamic school to Islam, or a Jewish school to Judaism. Even worse, the loudest voices in the Democrat Party believe the answer is “no.”

The most influential and energized segment of the left is willing to skewer its own party to seize control of your children’s future. Monopolizing the next generation’s minds is the sine qua non of their quest to permanently change America.

Conservatives must not delude themselves into thinking they can just disengage from the culture war. The battle lines are drawn. And the left isn’t going to nicely make compromises and exceptions for you, no matter how far the bench you’re sitting on is from the field.

The Government Is Still Persecuting Jack Phillips For Being A Christian,"Last week, Denver District Judge A. Bruce Jones fined Jack Phillips, the owner of Masterpiece Bakery, for refusing to bake a cake that was blue on the outside and pink on the inside to celebrate the gender transition of Autumn Scardina. The court ruled that Phillips’s refusal to make the cake due to Scardina’s transgender status violated the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act.

Phillips argued he could not make the cake because the message it conveyed conflicts with his religious beliefs. The court countered that the case was about the refusal to sell a product, not compelled speech.

Phillips famously found himself in the government’s crosshairs for the first time years ago. In the Masterpiece Cakeshop case, the Supreme Court ruled narrowly in favor of Phillips, finding that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission displayed “a clear and impermissible hostility toward the sincere religious beliefs motivating his objection.” The Supreme Court left undecided whether a business owner’s rights to freedom of religion and speech can justify his refusal to engage in commerce with homosexuals.

In similar cases involving Oregon baker Sweet Cakes by Melissa and Washington state florist Arlene’s Flowers and Gifts, the high court remanded the cases back to the state courts for further adjudication. In the Oregon case, the state argued that “baking is conduct, not speech” in contending that “a bakery open to the public has no right to discriminate against customers on the basis of their sexual orientation.”

Discrimination entails treating an individual differently based on some characteristic, such as race, sex, or sexual orientation. But did Phillips actually engage in discrimination? His refusal to sell one of his cakes was based on the particular message conveyed by the design or inscription on the cake, not on whether the would-be customer was gay or transgender.

There is no indication that Phillips refused to sell any product to an LGBT person that he was willing to sell to a straight person. This is not discrimination; this is the right of a business owner to decide on both the products that he sells and those he does not.

Why Must Phillips Bake the Cake and No One Else?

Phillips is no ordinary baker; his talents are legendary and his cakes are recognized as genuine works of art. A Phillips cake has a unique signature precisely because he is the artist who created it. He simply does not wish his artistry to be used to advocate for lifestyles that he perceives violate his religious convictions.

The claim that no other bakery could produce a cake celebrating certain lifestyles only reinforces the argument that it is not possible to separate the cake from the artist who created it. If a cake is merely a cake, then those practicing LGBT lifestyles can easily secure one elsewhere. But they don’t want just a cake, they want a Phillips cake, either because those cakes are truly unique or because they want to compel certain speech from someone whose views they consider wrong-headed and in need of correction.

Courts should not be in the re-education business. They should protect our freedoms and constitutional protections as those were originally drafted regardless of whether they are considered politically acceptable by the standards and mores of the modern day.

The founders did not intend for the courts to determine what constitutes a legitimate religious belief or practice. In “Memorial and Remonstrance against Religious Assessments,” James Madison observed: “The Religion then of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every man; and it is the right of every man to exercise it as these may dictate. This right is in its nature an unalienable right.”

Madison further recognized in “Federalist 51” that constant vigil is required to protect against undue government encroachment.

But what is government itself but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.

The extant case is arguably not about discrimination, unless it is discrimination against Phillips’s religious beliefs, but about the Colorado Civil Rights Commission expressing its disapproval of his views. Phillips does not think the way the commission thinks he should. Phillips is a devout Christian, and the government should not force him to employ his skills in a manner that offends his faith.

Legal compulsion is one of the most invasive measures by which the government can regulate behavior. Its use should be measured and carefully circumscribed with due consideration given to the precedent that is being set.

This Is Up to Individual Choice, Not State Coercion

Even if the high court were to take this case and ultimately find in favor of Phillips, this does not mean that he has not paid an economic price for his views. Social media stands ready to influence the demand for the product Phillips sells and, in turn, the earnings generated by Masterpiece Bakery.

Some would-be customers will shun the bakery simply because of the owner’s views, while others will go out of their way to patronize the bakery to show support for the importance of protecting religious liberties. The net effect is uncertain.

For example, despite practices that some find objectionable, so far it appears Chick-fil-A has not been harmed in the marketplace by some of its executives’ beliefs about government licenses for gay relationships. This may indicate that the collective public sentiment is neutral to positive.

Conversely, in the case of the aforementioned Oregon bakery, the public outcry on social media, which included threats of violence, was so fervent that the bakery was forced to close its brick and mortar business and retreat exclusively to an online presence. The collective public sentiment was decidedly negative in that case. There is reason for hope for Phillips. His bakery is still standing despite being engaged in this protracted battle for nearly a decade.

Jack Phillips should not be persecuted by the government for his religious beliefs or the manner in which he practices them, nor should those engaged in alternative lifestyles be persecuted for theirs. It is ironic that a community that stresses the importance of tolerance should be so intolerant of those holding different views. Phillips is not discriminating against LGBT people; he is simply exercising his constitutional right not to be an advocate for their cause.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/06/25/thanks-to-supreme-court-cowardice-the-government-is-still-persecuting-jack-phillips-for-being-a-christian/,2021-06-25
What's Stopping Disney From More LGBT Characters Like Loki? China,"The MCU officially has their first openly gay main character. Sort of.

Midway through episode three of the latest MCU Disney Plus series “Loki,” a small conversation between the God of Mischief and an alternate universe version of himself called Sylvie reveals that both have a dating history of impermanent dalliances with both men and women. Lasting under 30 seconds, the bit of dialogue serves little plot function except to show the bonding between the two versions of Loki.

Unsurprisingly, the internet went wild. A new episode of a Disney Plus MCU series will always trend on Twitter, but a substantial quantity of the discussion for the episode was dedicated to this 30-second clip. It is unambiguously clear from this instance that Loki is bisexual, as is his female variant, but this is all to which the reveal amounts.

Across his many MCU appearances, Loki has never had a canonical love interest of either sex. He is certainly a charmer, passively flirting with a vast array of characters, from Jeff Goldblum’s tyrannical leader in “Ragnarok” to Sylvie in the aforementioned episode, but there has been nothing to even suggest a possible romantic or sexual relationship.

It is likely that the sum total endgame of this reveal is the line itself, a canonical declaration that Loki dates men and women, with no effect on his character or the narrative.

The China Problem

Disney Plus should be the place where Marvel could inch towards including gay characters, if they truly desired, as it is not currently launched in China. The Communist Chinese censors are not friendly to LGBT content, which is not formally banned but often flagged.

Due to the increasing importance of the Chinese market to inflate box office returns, studios and directors are seeking a means by which to balance attention-gaining representation in the West with acceptable content overseas. Although some find this type of move hollow and frustrating, it generates a substantial amount of press.

The press and social media were flooded with reports of Sulu from “Star Trek” or LeFou in the live-action “Beauty and the Beast” would be gay, but these instances would have gone unnoticed and remained unclear had it not been for press releases before the films premiered.

Marvel trafficked in a similarly cynical marketing strategy by loudly announcing an unambiguously gay character in “Avengers: Endgame,” only for the widely reported scene to be a comment by an unnamed man in a support group about a date he went on with another guy. “Endgame” did not need the attention, as it was the climax of a gargantuan franchise with an enormous fanbase and went on to break box office records. In fact, the moment was widely criticized, noted for its obvious attempts at pandering without any substance.

Some movies which fail to comply can either be banned in China or faced edits in order to appease the censors, which could severely harm the quality or clarity of the story. “Bohemian Rhapsody” endured cuts that rendered the narrative incomprehensible. To save their work from such a fate, without standing up to the censors, these ambiguous or easily-removed nods are treated as an adequate replacement.

The Future of the MCU

This move calls into question the handling of several existing and upcoming MCU characters. Taika Waititi, who is directing the upcoming “Thor: Love and Thunder,” and actress Tessa Thompson have expressed an interest in portraying Valkyrie as bisexual, as she is in the comics, after a canonical depiction was excised from “Thor Ragnarok.”

“The Eternals” is set to have a kiss between Brian Tyree Henry and his male love interest, but with how intensely director Chloe Zhao has spent last awards season pandering to China in order to ensure the film’s success, this heavily discussed event will likely be far less notable than advertised, akin to Sulu in “Star Trek” or the “Rise of Skywalker” kiss.

While they have yet to be formally announced, the storyline likely to be most affected by these next few decisions regarding gay characters and China is the Young Avengers. With America Chavez set to feature in the new Doctor Strange film, Kate Bishop being introduced in “Hawkeye,” and Wiccan, Speed, Patriot, and Stature all introduced in existing MCU projects, the onscreen adaptation seems inevitable.

Yet with many of their major storylines heavily featuring the relationship between Billy Kaplan and Teddy Altman, to the point their romance and the mission objectives are often intrinsically narratively tied, this tip-toeing towards unambiguity could give some fans hope that will likely result in disappointment.

Gender and Shapeshifting

This bisexuality reveal is not the only aspect of Loki’s character garnering attention in discussions of representation. Stills from the initial trailer had shown Loki’s paperwork to detail his “sex” as “fluid.”

Some have taken this to mean that Loki identifies as gender-fluid, even as his portrayal appears to negate this supposition. Although Loki has a female variant, he is referred to as a man, with masculine pronouns and words like “son,” and “brother.” The fluidity comes in the form of his ability to shapeshift.

Many comic book shapeshifters, including Loki, seem to have some flexibility regarding gender, as the physical ability to adjust into anyone at a moment’s notice would alter one’s relationship to any immutable characteristic. If the corporeal form is as malleable and ephemeral as it is for people like Loki or X-Men’s Mystique, the defining labels follow suit, especially since Loki has given birth and the female Mystique was nearly made Nightcrawler’s father by Chris Claremont.

For Marvel shapeshifters, gender fluidity is not treated as an identity but a facet of a complex superpower. There are no new pronouns to be demanded, just the acknowledgment that they can physically shift between appearances at will, at times taking on new identities with the new forms.

Ultimately, Loki’s coming out of sorts will likely have little tangible impact on the future of the MCU. He is not slated to return in the next Thor film, despite rumors persisting to the contrary. Romantic subplots appear to be rightfully taking a backseat in favor of its time-bending, interdimensional adventures, and with only three episodes left of “Loki,” this does not appear to be changing anytime soon.

As for the rest of the MCU, fans of characters like Wiccan or Speed should not hold their breath for their being depicted faithfully. So long as Communist China is a major market, studios will be more interested in expanding the market than standing up for their creations and against censorship. Instead, much ado will continue to be made about these minor moments, garnering the desired attention while forgoing any meaningful development.

'Trans Mission' Raises Questions Trans Activists Refuse To Answer,"Transgenderism escalated quickly. As it burst into the nation’s consciousness just more than half a decade ago, we were told the trans movement was about being kind to Bruce as he became Caitlyn. Now we are told that it is about supporting the sterilization and castration of children. Instead of a male former Olympian trying to live as a woman, we now have males competing as women in the Olympics.

The mutilation of children is not the only concerning part of the trans agenda, but it is the most extreme demand. We are instructed by the powers that be, from the Biden administration to Big Tech to corporate media, that “trans kids” know who they are and we must therefore support chemically and surgically remaking their bodies. Not to do so, we are warned, is to drive these children to suicide.

Yet this narrative struggles to answer many reasonable questions. Why has there been a surge of minors identifying as transgender — including many cases in which gender dysphoria appears to be sudden and socially induced, rather than innate and persistent? What about the people who regret “transitioning” and seek to “de-transition”? Are children capable of informed consent for genital mutilation?

These queries are at the heart of “Trans Mission: What’s the Rush to Reassign Gender?” This new documentary is available on YouTube (for now, at least) and was produced by Jennifer Lahl of the Center for Bioethics and Culture Network. The film’s creators understood the audience wants answers to these questions, and let their subjects answer them.

“Trans Mission” therefore opens with the stories of people who have “de-transitioned,” which are rarely acknowledged by corporate media. These regrets pose a significant problem for the transgender movement, which has opposed any barriers to transgender procedures, even for children. But many of the physical and psychological consequences of surgeries like castration and mastectomies are permanent.

The film features doctors and parents who share these concerns. The doctors’ concerns are clinical, noting the health risks of chemically delayed puberty, cross-sex hormones, and so-called “gender-affirming” surgeries. The parents are deeply concerned for their children and angered that the transgender movement, including therapists and teachers, validates threats of suicide as demands for “transition.”

It is far from clear that sterilizing surgeries and hormone treatments reduce suicide among those with gender dysphoria, let alone among such children. On the contrary, they include a host of health risks and irreversible changes. Giving females large doses of testosterone is not good for them, and giving children puberty blockers followed by cross-sex hormones can sterilize them, even before surgery.

These are weighty matters. The transgender agenda makes extraordinary claims and issues extraordinary demands. It declares a boy may actually be a girl, or vice versa. It proclaims children have an innate, immutable gender identity (which they may know even as toddlers) that supersedes anatomy. And it insists any claims to transgender identity (or in the case of young children, perceived expressions of such an identity) be uncritically affirmed and supported.

It’s not news that some people are, at different points in life, distressed by their bodies and specifically their sex. Such individuals should be treated with compassion and respect. But the reasonable response in such cases is not to fabricate a persona of the opposite sex, with the likely result of surgery and sterilization. It’s especially unreasonable for very young children.

These matters should at least be up for debate, but the transgender movement and its powerful supporters have sought to stifle discussion. Critics are punished and censored.

It’s also not just social conservatives who are targeted. As “Trans Mission” shows, feminists and homosexual activists also have reason to resist the trans movement, which erases the distinction between the biological sexes. Many feminists, for example, are appalled by the male invasion of female spaces, from homeless shelters to sports. However, such reasonable concerns are often brushed aside or tarred as bigotry.

That’s why films like “Trans Mission” are important. This film is not the final word, but it is an important contribution to a conversation we must have, even if some would prefer suppression to discussion. In this, the tone of the documentary is an important asset. Although its subjects are sometimes emotional, this film is not shrill. It aims to inform, not to alienate.

There will, of course, be critics of this film. But trans advocates who seek to persuade, rather than intimidate, must address the questions the film raises. In particular, they must confront the problems of pushing trans ideology on children.

Even if we accepted the claim that some adults should surgically alter their bodies to impersonate the opposite sex, could we ever justify putting young children on a course of social and medical interventions that will leave them sterile and consigned to a life of potentially hazardous hormone treatments?

Compassion and kindness demand we answer these questions honestly and accurately. This is not about being nice to Caitlyn. It’s about ruinous mutilations of children’s bodies.

Barclays Demands Employees Mindlessly Agree With LGBTQ Mantras,"Barclays is demanding its employees mindlessly agree with LBGTQ mantras in a creepy pride video.

During pride month in June, the multinational bank instructed employees how to “support pride by understanding how our actions can help the LGBT+ community.”

“Gender identity, gender expression, sexuality, attraction [sic] are all different elements to what makes a person up,” a narrator explains. “There doesn’t need to be a link between them. By educating yourself, standing up for others, and being visible in your support, you’re saying ‘I’m an ally.'”

Sometimes gender identity, expression and sexuality are linked, sometimes, they’re not. Sionice talks about gender identity and how we can all become better allies by being aware, respectful and standing up for the community. #withpridehttps://t.co/BztMHmdEvf pic.twitter.com/IzzSpn7X8g — Barclays UK (@BarclaysUK) June 30, 2021

In addition to disturbingly telling employees to state their alliance with gay, transgender, and other queer people, the company openly encourages employees to prioritize “championing equality, understanding, respect, and inclusivity for the LGBT+ community.”

“Making everyone feel comfortable being themselves at work is central to our culture. We nurture this through activities and initiatives, and building networks for colleagues to connect,” the bank’s pride and diversity page states. “The march towards true equality is far from over. Pride is a time to celebrate how far we’ve come. But it’s also a time to reflect on how we can make things better and continue to serve our LGBT+ community.”

The website also offers a “hear from our colleagues” section imploring members of the company to use “personal pronouns,” affirm “gender identity,” and “avoiding microaggressions”

“Microaggression, whether intentional or unintentional, can negatively affect people within the LBGT+ community,” the specialized section with a video explains.

Other videos featured on the page explain “how we can all become better allies by being aware, respectful and standing up for the community” and “asking someone which pronouns they prefer instead of assuming can make all the difference” so as not to “misgender” someone.

"Thanks To Neil Gorsuch, Biden Is Forcing Transgenderism On Employers","As a labor and employment attorney, I have handled cases before the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for almost two decades. This is probably how I got invited to the EEOC-sponsored event, “AANHPI + Pride: Intersecting Identities at Work and Beyond.”

For the uninitiated, AANHPI stands for “Asian American Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders.” And yes, the presenters repeated the alphabet string “AAHNPI LGBTQIA+ community” many, many times.

White House appointee Erika Moritsugu kicked off the presentation by boasting that 14 percent of Biden’s appointees are LGBT. She also touted President Biden’s executive orders on “equity,” which blatantly pander to identity groups based on race and sexual self-identification, using purposefully vague language to enable maximum federal power and involvement.

EEOC Vice Chair Jocelyn Samuels spoke as well, and committed the EEOC to expanding its outreach, education, investigation, and litigation efforts, particularly toward a “robust implementation of the Bostock decision.”

Using Bostock to Tyrannize Language and Privacy

Last year, in the case Bostock v. Clayton County, the Supreme Court expanded Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to prohibit distinctions based on sexual orientation and gender identity. New EEOC guidance uses Bostock to force companies to open bathrooms, locker rooms, and showers to employees based on the sex they profess to be. The EEOC also interprets Bostock to mean calling transgender employees by their sex-accurate name and pronouns can constitute unlawful harassment.

In plain language, employers can no longer exclude men from women’s private areas. Employers must also police the use of pronouns by employees, disciplining dissenters in some cases. Further, the EEOC urges employees to file complaints so the full power of federal enforcement and private litigation will come down on any employer who doesn’t comply. (Thanks for enabling this bureaucratic harassment in Bostock, Justice Neil Gorsuch!)

Meanwhile, the presentation continued its descent into madness, condemning state laws that exclude men from women’s sports (calling them “bullying disguised as legislation”). One panelist, an EEOC attorney, claimed such bills must be motivated by misogyny, because they focus on trans women (biological men) instead of trans men (biological women). Despite an Ivy League education, this panelist somehow missed the fact that women (whatever sex they say they are) pose zero threat to men’s sports.

Unable to let such blatant science denial pass, I asked a question in the chat box. “What do you suggest as a solution to the women’s sports / trans athlete conundrum?” I asked, trying to use the lingo. “Specifically the physical advantages of trans women over cis women. How would you resolve?”

In response, the panelist told me: “This is simply a non-issue. The [International Olympic Committee] and the NCAA already have sensible policies in place that require trans women to have testosterone levels comparable to those of cis women. The reality for trans women who are on hormone therapy is that there is no competitive advantage.”

The fact that hormone therapy does not change men’s height, muscle mass, lung capacity, or red blood cell count did not stop this highly-educated government attorney from peddling lies.

The EEOC’s Mission … Abolishing ICE and Prisons?

But wait, there’s more! According to the illustrious panelists, the EEOC’s mission to enforce equal opportunity should encompass many leftist priorities. These included abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement; ending incarceration (while somehow also stopping anti-Asian violence); ending prejudice against prostitution; imposing pay equity; and expanding the welfare state to “give people access to what they need to survive and thrive.”

A link to the “Trans Agenda for Liberation” was promoted. Meanwhile, no one bothered to address my second question, about the accommodation of religious beliefs. Finally, the moderator called time (which was good, because my head was exploding).

Put aside, for now, the fact that American taxpayers are involuntarily funding hundreds of unelected, unaccountable federal agencies like the EEOC. With the full support of the Biden administration, the EEOC has declared war on people who hold traditional views on sex, women who value their safety and privacy, and people who simply believe in science (not to mention Asian Americans who don’t view themselves as victims). They will not stop until we have been educated, investigated, and litigated into submission.

Ironically, these radical EEOC policies will not help employees with gender dysphoria win friends and influence people. Instead, ham-handed mandates are creating alienation and outrage among employees who previously just wanted to do their work and live in peace.

This regime forces employers to waste enormous amounts of time and money on compliance (i.e., lawyers), Orwellian training, complaint hotlines, and redesigning perfectly serviceable bathroom facilities. And employees waste time and brain cells on continuous self-censorship, while struggling with how to stand up for their convictions without getting fired. Actual work, of course, goes on the back burner.

How to Fight Back

So what can freedom-loving Americans do? First, it’s important to realize EEOC guidance does not have the force of law. Anyone who has money and legal firepower to challenge some of the EEOC’s radical applications of Bostock should do so. The Bostock decision held that employers cannot fire employees for their sexual orientation or gender identity; it did not rule on bathrooms, pronouns, or religious accommodation. Litigants with resources should seek to limit the Bostock opinion wherever possible.

Second, Americans should use their voices and votes to oppose the Biden administration’s agenda. Contact your senators and other representatives, tell them how the EEOC (and other agencies) are running amok, and let them know your vote is on the line.

Gather like-minded individuals in your community. Make sure your elected officials in Washington and at home know you will not bow to the extremist LGBT agenda, and you will not support those who do.

Finally, be courageous. Don’t be obnoxious, but if you are able to speak your convictions you should do so. Others may be encouraged by your example. If you have religious beliefs on sex and sexuality, learn how to share them in a clear and engaging way. Explore ways to free yourself from the EEOC-dominated W-2 workplace, perhaps through gig and contract work.

The EEOC may be large and powerful, but they can’t arraign everyone. Perhaps if enough Americans say “enough,” we can end the nonsense.

Virginia LGBT Group Targets Muslim School Board Member For ‘Emotional Violence’,"Muslim leftist school board member Abrar Omeish is under attack from Pride Liberation Project, a coalition of LGBT students in Fairfax County, Virginia. Omeish, who touts herself as “the people’s advocate” and a defender of minorities, is the latest target of the LGBT group, who criticizes her for not being a “100 percent ally” of queer students.

Thread (1/5): Today at noon, the Pride Liberation Project released a press release discussing harmful statements made by @AbrarOmeish during a private meeting with Brown, Muslim, South Asian, and North African student representatives of the PLP. pic.twitter.com/VMQ0pZNg7t — Pride Liberation Project (@PrideLiberation) July 16, 2021

In the letter posted on Friday, the group said queer and brown students met with Omeish to discuss perceived prejudice against them at Fairfax County public schools. In response, Omeish reportedly said being invited to a pride parade would “give [her] pause.”

“She claimed it would be a ‘challenge’ for her to provide an ‘outward endorsement or encouragement’ of Queer students, and that there was a ‘difference between going after oppression and endorsing’ LGBTQIA+ students,” the letter read. “We expected Ms. Omeish, who presents herself as a relentless champion for equity, to be a champion and ally for the Queer community. We are saddened that she cannot meet our expectations.”

The group laid out a long list of demands towards Omeish, calling on her to issue an apology, affirm LGBT student existence and identity, and clarify her stance on a motion to include non-traditional family structures in Fairfax County curriculum. Omeish was listed as “not present” when the school board vote took place last month.

The students also demanded Omeish take more action in her personal life to commit to LGBT students.

“Such a commitment should include, but is not limited to, promises to work with Queer students in working groups, hosting live streams that discuss Queer issues, and ensuring that Queer issues are included in her policy platform,” according to the letter.

The students also demanded her attendance at “family-friendly Pride Parades and posting publicly about Queer issues.”

Omeish did not immediately respond to The Federalist’s request for comment.

Don't Let The American Medical Association Neuter Your Birth Certificate,"The American Medical Association’s latest resolution on sex and birth certificates is a mind-bender.

In its June report, which began circulating on Twitter over the weekend and advocates for the removal of sex designations on birth certificates, the board of trustees managed to redefine nearly enough words to fill a pocket dictionary — not only “sex” and “gender,” but even “discrimination,” “intersex,” “assign,” and “violence.” It’s enough to make even the sanest person question her grasp on reality.

“Existing AMA policy recognizes that every individual has the right to determine their gender identity and sex designation on government documents,” the report concluded. “To protect individual privacy and to prevent discrimination, U.S. jurisdictions should remove sex designation on the birth certificate.”

The American Medical Association was quick to point out that this would affect birth certificates only, not the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth, meaning a baby’s sex would still be reported to the government for scientific and statistical reasons, but the feds just wouldn’t include that sex distinction on the subsequent birth certificate they issue. In other words, the AMA board contended, wishing away these sex distinctions on a birth certificate would protect transgender-identifying people from violence and discrimination, but their biological realities would still be reported to the government for medical purposes.

Is This Medical?

This all raises the question of why an association of doctors with “medical” in their name is making recommendations for non-medical documentation. After all, they admit it is important for scientists and medical professionals to have accurate biological information about the populations they study and patients they treat — that’s the medical part. But for a birth certificate, dispensing with reality is a nonissue.

Another question that arises is why so-called gender has any relevance in matters of sex distinction. The LGBT lobby and leftists the world over will tell you — or more likely scream at you — that “sex and gender are different.” Why then would the AMA, under the banner of LGBT advocacy, push for sex to be removed from birth certificates?

If a person’s gender is detatched from his sex (it is not, but for a moment just entertain the delusion), why should he care that the way he identifies doesn’t match the “M” or “F” on his birth certificate? If the argument goes that gender and sex are different, then why is gender identity relevant in matters of sex? Why is something so purportedly so irrelevant to one’s identity so triggering?

With a slip of the pen, the AMA reveals the faults in the false trans narrative that “gender is a social construct.” Notice the flip-flopping between “sex” and “gender” in the board’s report (emphasis mine):

Sex designation, as collected through the standard form and included on the birth certificate, refers to the biological difference between males and females. Today, the majority of states (48) and the District of Columbia allow people to amend their sex designation on their birth certificate to reflect their individual gender identities, but only 10 states allow for a gender-neutral designation, typically ‘X,’ on the birth certificate. Existing AMA policy recognizes that every individual has the right to determine their gender identity and sex designation on government documents.

So if “sex designation” is “the biological difference between males and females” (which, if by “designation,” you mean “specification,” then that’s correct), then why do “gender identity” and “gender-neutral” enter the conversation? And why is “sex” then immediately described as something you have “the right to determine”?

The same people whose veins pop out of their faces while they rage that gender is different from sex conflate the two here — not only because gender is in fact inextricable from sex but because in this case, it fits their narrative.

Where’s the Proof?

All sorts of other issues clutter the AMA board’s resolution, such as this one: “For these individuals, having a gender identity that does not match the sex designation on their birth certificate can result in confusion, possible discrimination, harassment and violence whenever their birth certificate is requested.”

While there’s most certainly some type of confusion present when a man identifies as a woman or vice versa, it’s unlikely that a birth certificate’s sex distinction is the cause of that confusion. Nor does the AMA provide any evidence for sex distinctions causing discrimination, harassment, or violence.

The United States is so far through the looking glass of radical gender theory that a massive medical association can claim, without evidence and without serious corporate media coverage, that non-medical government documents stating the simple biological fact of whether one’s chromosomes include a “Y” (which is apparently different from gender yet completely the same) are discriminatory precursors to violence that confound the already-confused and must therefore be overhauled for equity — did you follow that?

If not, you’re not alone. The gender jungle gym will have you throwing up your hands with confusion before you realize its goal is redefining reality and making you participate.

Equity Trumps All

Of course, this whole AMA push fits squarely within the brave new world of progressive medicine, and it’s a dangerous world indeed. It’s the same world that wants to treat black and brown patients before white ones — no triage required — because “equity.” It’s the world in which a baby dies because the doctors accommodated the child’s mother playacting as a male.

“He was rightly classified as a man,” Dr. Daphna Stroumsa wrote of a pregnant woman whose baby died because doctors treated the mother as a transgender man, dispensing with science and medical ethics in the New England Journal of Medicine. “But that classification threw us off from considering his actual medical needs.”

Unlike the AMA’s lack of evidence that danger befalls trans people because of their birth certificates, history shows an obsession with these dishonest “classifications” comes with real life-or-death consequences. Even when a human being doesn’t die, fidelity to the truth most certainly does.

The legal designation on your birth certificate was never intended to reflect how you feel. The Department of States just wants to make sure you exist. They aren’t interested in whether you believe in a binary. Your future employer doesn’t want a peek at your birth certificate to determine whether you prefer to be called he or she or moonself. They just want to know that you are who you say you are.

Nothing about the American Medical Association’s advocacy is medical. It’s just the next step in the dangerous transformation of health care into a science-devoid cesspool of social justice.

Wisconsin Parents Are Fed Up With Schools' Attempts To Brainwash Kids,"Wisconsin parents are fed up with their school districts’ attempts to indoctrinate their children, and they aren’t going to stay quiet any longer.

For months, parents in the largest GOP suburban stronghold in the state, located outside Milwaukee, have tried to push back on the Elmbrook School District’s creeping shift to the left. Now, they are asking other residents to sign a petition demanding Elmbrook prioritize “education over activism.”

“It’s been a lot of very involved parents looking at what their kids are studying probably because they’ve been home and doing remote learning, but also realizing that things are very aggressively moving in a very far-left direction,” one concerned mother whose child attends an Elmbrook school told The Federalist. “Our district started this in 2012, but nobody knew it and our school board didn’t know it, so there’s a lot that the community has just been complacent in.”

In their most recent quest to hold Superintendent Mark Hansen accountable, parents raised alarms with the help of the Wisconsin Insitute for Law and Liberty about sexually explicit material located in the district’s shared online library. In their strongly worded letter filled with examples of lewd descriptions and instructions for how to use a sex app from the books, the Wisconsin Insitute for Law and Liberty demanded that Elmbrook take proper steps to eradicate the content and reevaluate any further explicit material that may be available to schoolchildren.

The school district maintains that the books “were never accessible to elementary students and were not part of our human growth and development curriculum” and told The Federalist that the books were removed. Hansen, however, did not give an answer concerning what age he believes children should begin learning about how to perform sexual acts as depicted in the books “This Book is Gay” and “Queer: The Ultimate LGBTQ Guide for Teens.”

“They’re using that LGBTQ piece as a Trojan horse to push this because so many people just look at that, as one of our local papers portrayed it, as an LGBTQ resource book,” the mother said.

The district previously ran into trouble for sexually inappropriate material after a high school teacher sent out a reportedly unapproved sex survey to students without parental permission. Brookfield Central Principal Brett Gruetzmacher told The Federalist that the teacher who was caught by parents submitted her resignation, but he did not state what further actions the school would take.

Incidents like this, the mother told The Federalist, are part of a larger failure by the district to address problems in curriculum and students’ academic performance as evidenced by falling test scores.

Initially, the mother said she stayed quiet despite mounting concern over what the district was teaching her kids, but she said she’s finally reached her breaking point.

“I’m fighting the fight because it’s the right thing to do because, from a moral perspective, I want a better world for my kids or my grandchildren,” she said. “I look at what’s happening and I’m like, I can’t be quiet about this.”

Critical race theory, the mom said, is also something she and many fellow parents are keeping an eye on after the district, which denied teaching racist material, paid for training disguised as a resource for creating “equity.”

“The Kendi version is dehumanizing. You’re asking one group to be viewed as an oppressor and the other group to be seen as the oppressed. You’re constantly perpetuating this victim and victimization narrative, right to the point even where we’ve gotten it right,” she said. “Now you’re segregating them again because … there are all these underlying messages that black people are oppressed by white people.”

Even community members whose children don’t attend Elmbrook schools are sensing the urgency and becoming involved in the fight against the district and its agenda-driven leadership.

“I care because it’s all of my kids’ peers, it’s all of our neighbors’ kids. In 20 years, this is who they’re going to be having discussions with, and what they’re doing in the schools is they’re completely destroying the cultural net and unity because the only thing that makes Americans Americans is our ideals,” another concerned mother told The Federalist. “There’s nothing else that unites us. There’s not a religion, there’s not a race, there’s not a bloodline. … How are my kids who I’m training up in with traditional American values and understandings, how are they supposed to converse with people who have no understanding of what they’re talking about and have been completely brainwashed?”

“Really what I find most disturbing is that they are keeping, they keep on pushing the agenda,” she added.

Some of the same parents who expressed concerns with the school district joined with nearly 40 advocacy groups representing more than 20,000 families in Wisconsin to rip into President Joe Biden and Democrat Gov. Tony Evers for the new wave of potential mask mandates and lockdowns facing their state.

In the letter, the organizations including We The Parents, Wisconsin United for Freedom, and No Left Turn in Education Wisconsin pledged to reject any mask requirements on children in schools.

“Simply put, these are not your children. They are ours and they too, are Americans with rights. They are our responsibility and our most beloved. They are not yours,” the letter states.

Parents also banded together in February to protest the district’s review of its social study curriculum and subsequent survey circulated by activists and the Parent Network and Leadership Council, the district’s parent-teacher association, asking parents if children should learn about “segregation in Milwaukee, past and present,” “waves of feminism and its failures, white feminism (e.g. how the 19th Amendment did not protect black/brown women’s right to vote, etc.),” and “Stonewall/LGBTQ Liberation/AIDS epidemic.”

Head Of Largest LGBT Group Gave Cuomo Aides Info To Smear His Victim,"Alphonso David, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBT activist and lobbying group in the United States with far-left interests, gave New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s aides a confidential file about one of the Democrat politician’s victims after she publicly called out the governor for sexual harassment.

In a damning report released by the New York attorney general this week, investigators confirmed that Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women and that his administration drafted an op-ed-type letter that “attacked Ms. [Lindsey] Boylan [one of his victims] for alleged conduct at work, for alleged conduct with men, other than the governor, as well as postulating various political conspiracies including that Ms. Boylan was funded by far-right Republicans and supporters of Donald Trump.”

“Although the letter was never published, it was sent or read to a variety of people outside the executive chamber either to get their advice or ask them to sign their names to it and shared, ultimately, with at least one member of the press,” the investigator stated in a press conference this week. “The governor was arguing for the release of that letter.”

According to the report, David, who worked in Cuomo’s office for eight years before leaving for the Human Rights Campaign in 2019, “agreed to ask former Cuomo aides to sign the letter” and even claimed he would sign it himself if Cuomo’s aides requested it.

“Mr. David testified that he did not agree to have his name attached to the statement because he did not know if the statements in it were true and he did not think it was a good response,” the report states. “He nonetheless agreed to read it and convey its substance to other former employees to see if they would sign it.”

David, who claims he had copies of Boylan’s files because it “may have been the only instance where [he] was actually involved in a counseling of an employee when [he] was in the Executive Chamber,” denied any wrongdoing and said he was legally obligated to release the documents requested by the administration after Boylan went public with her allegations. David also said he was unaware of the aides’ intentions for the documents.

“Reading the Attorney General’s report made me sick to my stomach. As much as I knew Governor Cuomo to be a demanding boss, I never imagined he would have engaged in illegal conduct,” David told The Hill before promoting the HRC’s message of “equality and justice for all people.” “He has to resign. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to the survivors for their courage in speaking out.”

Despite concern and outrage from HRC employees, who said their organization should not be run by someone who “care[s] more about staying in the good graces of people in power,” David faces no punishment from the HRC for his involvement in the Cuomo scandal and will continue to act as president under a contract that was recently extended.

David also does not plan to resign from his position despite some demands from employees and others such as Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, who is a lesbian.

I will not be accepting any campaign donations or support from @HRC unless and until there is a new president of this organization. https://t.co/zUgmWQi37T — Dana Nessel (@dananessel) August 5, 2021

Two co-founders of Time’s Up, a group dedicated to helping victims of sexual harassment, also allegedly helped Cuomo’s aides create the hit letter directed at downplaying the allegations of sexual harassment against the governor.

‘Jungle Cruise’ Proves Disney Doesn’t Actually Mind Offensive Stereotypes,"There have been few corporate “awokenings” as indicative of America’s leftward cultural shift as that of the Walt Disney Company. Disney’s embrace of identity politics is shamefully on display whether the company is hocking LGBT merchandise, coercing employees to attend critical race theory training, or turning muppets into transexuals. One of the most recognizable American brands worldwide has invested an alarming amount of its resources into appeasing the left’s cultural revolution.

This investment is clearly cynical. Disney does not take the standards of the new cultural overlords seriously; it just expects everyone else to adhere to them. This double standard is on full display in Disney Studios’ recent summer blockbuster, “Jungle Cruise.” The film disparages both indigenous peoples and LGBT people.

The ‘Noble Savage’ Stereotype

Throughout the film, Frank Wolff — portrayed by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson — maintains a relationship with the fictitious Puka Michuna tribe in the Amazon River valley. They are introduced to the audience as lovable-scamp accomplices to Wolff as he runs a jump-scare river cruise scam to rip off tourists from Europe.

Later, they help Wolff stage a kidnapping by tranquilizing him and his counterparts. When Wolff and his travel companions awaken, they face a ritual tribunal of sorts in which tribe members have donned extravagant and ostensibly spiritual garb, speak in their native tongue, and threaten to cannibalize the sailors for their transgressions.

When Wolff’s scheme falls apart, Trader Sam — the tribe’s chieftain — says, “Seriously, Frank. Next time I’m going to charge you more for this ‘booga-booga’ nonsense.” She subsequently takes Wolff’s aggrieved compatriots into her encampment and explains the nuances of her tribe’s religion.

“Jungle Cruise” caricatures the indigenous peoples of South America as “noble savages” so they might serve as both a cheap punch line and a convenient apparatus to move the plot along. The film even turned Trader Sam into a major character although his inspiration was deemed racist enough to remove from the film’s eponymous theme park attraction.

MacGregor Houghton, Walking LGBT Stereotype

The film even stereotypes homosexual men in the form of MacGregor Houghton. In fact, MacGregor is something like Disney’s seventh “first openly gay character.”

MacGregor’s sexual orientation was such an important attribute to his character that the film made him a walking stereotype. He brings entirely too many suitcases onto Wolff’s minuscule vessel (which the uber-masculine everyman character portrayed by The Rock mockingly tosses overboard), wears inopportune outfits for the sake of making a fashion statement, and is steadfastly effeminate in his interactions with all things outdoors.

MacGregor eventually comes out of the closet to Wolff, divulging that he has refused to marry several eligible young women in Europe because his “interests happily lay elsewhere.” Shortly after that, MacGregor offers Johnson’s character the opportunity to “bite down” on his “stick,” debuting Disney’s first-ever cinematic homoerotic fellatio joke.

MacGregor provides comic relief throughout the film, but he’s portrayed as a gay man’s caricature more concerned with skincare and fashion despite his alleged depth of character.

Calling Out Old Stereotypes While Creating New Ones

Thus, “Jungle Cruise” portrays indigenous people and LGBT people as walking stereotypes. The film shows the natives of South America as hooting and hollering savages for much of their on-screen presence and treats the sole gay character in the film as an uptight dandy. At the same time, the Walt Disney Company has the audacity to gloat about their intersectional awareness and ram it down your throat.

Disney might be cyclically peddling woke identity politics to appease social trends, but that doesn’t mean their actions are without consequence. In spring 2021, Disney restricted children’s access to some of their classic films like “Peter Pan,” “The Aristocats,” and the live-action “Swiss Family Robinson,” claiming these films depict various demographics in insensitive ways.

The change came alongside Disney’s “Stories Matter” initiative. This represented applying their “ongoing commitment to diversity and inclusion” to their film catalog by “reviewing our library and adding advisories to content that includes negative depictions or mistreatment of people or cultures.”

This advisory reads, “This program includes negative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures. These stereotypes were wrong then and are wrong now. Rather than remove this content, we want to acknowledge its harmful impact, learn from it and spark conversation to create a more inclusive future together.” There should be no doubt if Disney should include these disclaimers on recent content. They won’t.

“Jungle Cruise” cost an estimated $200 million to produce and hasn’t broken even at the time of this writing. Its stereotyping of indigenous and homosexual people will likely remain uninhibited since they’re trying to make their money back. Why would they put a “bigotry” disclaimer on one of their newest summer blockbusters?

Disney only cares about labeling things as “wrong” when it suits their agenda. There is no true moral conviction behind their leftward march. If there was, then “Jungle Cruise” would be a vastly different movie. But since there isn’t, the Walt Disney Company will continue to peddle woke talking points while disparaging the people they claim to champion when it can make them a quick buck.

Colorado Web Designer Petitions Supreme Court Over Religious Freedom,"DENVER — Lawyers representing a Colorado web designer who was slapped with a gag order in July that forced her to celebrate causes she believes are wrong filed a petition to appeal the case in the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday.

Lorie Smith, the founder of 303 Creative, lost a 2-1 ruling in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit which mandated that she create custom graphics and websites for LGBT customers despite messages that contradict her religious convictions.

“This case involves quintessential free speech and artistic freedom, which the 10th Circuit astonishingly and dangerously cast aside here,” Kristen Waggoner, the general counsel for the First Amendment legal foundation Alliance Defending Freedom, which has taken on Smith’s case, said in a press call with reporters. “The government shouldn’t weaponize the law to force a web designer to speak messages that violate her beliefs.”

The initial case was launched as a pre-enforcement challenge to Colorado’s Anti-Discrimination Act (CADA), the same law weaponized to go after a Denver-area cake artist for refusal to design a custom cake for a same-sex wedding and, more recently, a gender transition. The law prohibits any business that offers public services from discrimination based on race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. Smith challenged the law after she received an inquiry for a website for a same-sex wedding but did not respond to the order to avoid violating CADA.

The 10th Circuit rejected Smith’s case against CADA, writing that the law “permissibly compels [Lorie Smith’s] speech,” and concluded, “a faith that enriches society in one way might also damage society in [an]other.” Smith was also reprimanded with a gag order that keeps her from placing a note on her page about what sites would be consistent with her convictions.

“I have clients ranging from individuals to small business owners to nonprofit agencies. I have served and continue to serve all people, including those who identify LGBT,” Smith explained to reporters on Friday. “I simply object to being forced to pour my heart, my imagination, and talents into messages that violate my conscience.”

Waggoner said the legal team was optimistic that the Supreme Court would take up Smith’s case, arguing that the 10th Circuit’s decision was broad.

“I would be surprised if not all nine justice are deeply concerned about it,” said Waggoner, who went on to highlight the court’s prior rulings in defense of Masterpiece Cake Shop owner Jack Phillips.

In 2012, Phillips began to make headlines when he declined a request from a gay couple to design their custom wedding cake. At the time, Phillips offered a wide variety of other products, but rather than pick from the assorted goods or seek another cake shop, the engaged couple filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission.

The case cloaked in the moral righteousness of LGBT rights provoked harassment campaigns and death threats against Phillips, along with nearly 40 percent of his income and a decade of litigation as new complaints were filed inspired by the 2012 lawsuit.

In June, Phillips was fined $500 for refusal to design a cake celebrating gender dysphoria.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/09/24/colorado-web-designer-petitions-supreme-court-after-being-compelled-to-celebrate-what-she-believes-is-wrong/,2021-09-24
"New Sex Ed To Force Explicit Images, Gender Mayhem, Abortion On Kids","This article contains adult-level information about sex and genitals.

Last year, three leftist nonprofits created the National Sex Education Standards, a blueprint for the “sex education” of K-12 children. In practice, the standards serve as an indoctrination camp in extremist sexual ethics designed to destroy children’s innocence and undermine their attachment to the traditional, Judeo-Christian understanding of sex and marriage.

About 40 percent of school districts had adopted the earlier, less extreme 2011 version of the National Sexuality Education Standards, according to the Centers of Disease Control in a 2016 report. The new standards are radically more extreme.

The 2020 standards unequivocally endorse abortion at any time, teach the topic starting in sixth grade, and even force teachers to provide information on local abortion clinics to students in ninth grade. The standards also insist that children must be allowed to choose their own gender and false pronouns must “be respected by the adults in their lives.”

Kindergartners learn about gender identity, and third graders learn that gender is on a spectrum, about “the role of hormone blockers” for transgender youth, and how to “explain” masturbation. Sixth graders — ages eleven and twelve — must define oral, anal, and vaginal sex as well as the benefits of withdrawing one’s penis before ejaculation during intercourse and how to use dental dams during oral sex.

New Standards Even More Deranged

The 2020 version is different from the 2011 version as explained in the standards:

The updated [Standards] have been written with a trauma-informed lens; have been infused with principles of reproductive justice, racial justice, social justice, and equity; address social determinants of health and how these can lead to inequitable health outcomes; and take an intersectional approach. This edition uses less cis and heteronormative language that reflects a broader range of relationships and identities.

The new standards have entire sections in their “Guiding Principles” section devoted to “Social, Racial, and Reproductive Justice and Equity,” “Intersectionality,” and “Language Inclusivity.” They boast that “the updated NSES (Standards) calls attention to overt and covert discrimination.”

Disturbingly, the standards directly defy parental authority: “No one else is qualified to label or judge another person’s sexual identity, including their sexual orientation or gender identity, and it is important that the language and terms young people use to identify themselves is respected by the adults in their lives.”

Compare the number of times the following terms appear in each version.

2011 Standards 2020 Standards Transgender 3 21 Gender Identity 10 69 Sexual orientation 8 48 Gender 48 270 boy 7 1 (in context of “princess boys”) girl 7 0 Abstinence 27 20 Racism 0 9

Here’s How Austin Teaches This Curricula

The fruits of this deranged ideology are manifested in the Austin Independent School District’s curriculum, which is based on the standards. Austin is all in on leftist gender and same-sex ideology.

In sixth grade, teachers should explain that “people [incorrectly] assume that people with a penis are boys and people with a vagina are girls” and that students should not assume boys can only have girlfriends and vice versa. Even in kindergarten, after describing the “scrotum” as “the sack of skin that hangs below the penis,” teachers are to say, “Most of the time, people born with this reproductive system are called males, or boys.”

Sixth graders are also encouraged to attend an LGBT rally, “write down ways they can challenge homophobia,” and complete a biography of a “prominent LGBT figure in contemporary history.” Also in sixth grade, students are taught that assuming boys don’t wear dresses is a “stereotype.”

In that same lesson, students are to come up with solutions for a girl who wants to come out to her homophobic mother. In another story, a child and his mother are both happy her husband divorced her and married a man instead.

In a video shown to Austin’s eighth graders, a puppet bemoans the fact that people complain to him “about their homophobic dad or racist grandma” instead of correcting them. In seventh grade, the term “fondling” is described as “the manipulation of the genitals with the hand” coupled with assurances of its legality. The same lesson discourages child rearing by claiming a child will cost $233,610 until age 18.

Eighth graders are shown a video from amaze.org entitled “How to Talk to Boys, Girls, and Everyone in Between.” In another animated video on puberty, two animated breasts emerge suddenly to fill up half the screen, followed by the opening of several large bananas meant to represent penises, topped off by a large-chested animated woman in a very revealing bathing suit. Another lesson, designed for children in eighth grade, implicitly encourages anal and oral sex by claiming the only way to prevent pregnancy is “no penis-in-vagina sex” and that getting an STD is “nothing to be embarrassed about.”

A sixth-grade class claims the touching of breasts or genitals “inside clothes” “may be” considered abstinence. The same class contains a card game asking whether various acts, like “oral sex (mouth on genitals),” “anal sex (penis to anus),” and “ touching breasts (inside clothes)” are considered abstinence.

A seventh-grade class defines abstinence as anything but “sperm in vagina,” implying those who engage in oral and anal sex can be considered abstinent. In that same class, disturbing graphics from the CDC show how to put on a condom, despite a disclaimer from the CDC itself warning, “this document contains sexually graphic images and may not be suitable for some audiences.”

A lesson on sexually transmitted infections in sixth grade contains many graphic hypothetical scenarios. The following is typical: “Jamie and Jake are planning to have sex for the first time and are planning to do it the night of a party at their friends” or “Six months ago, Jonas was at a party and had too much to drink [and] ended up having unprotected sex.”

In the same class, students are asked to consider the risk of “frequent, chance sex with unknown partners” or ”sex, without a condom, with a partner you don’t know well,” among other questions. Another eighth-grade class makes a plug for the morning-after abortion pill.

This is widespread debasing of sex and the creation of new life through filling the minds of public school children with sordid sexual imagery. It interprets humans as animals operating on pure instinct.

For parents, there is nothing more disturbing than learning that their right to teach their children about sex, and the great responsibilities that accompany it, is being trampled by public schools. This must be stopped from spreading nationwide like its predecessor.

How to Address this Evil

Nothing has exploded onto the state and national scene like the counter-response to critical race theory (CRT), the idea that power in society is set up to benefit the white race. Because so many students were schooled from home during the pandemic, parents saw firsthand their hateful and propaganda-ridden curriculum materials. This has made K-12 education a fertile field for reform, and activists against CRT took advantage.

Since so many metropolitan areas have become so left-leaning, it is very difficult to enact change in localities like Austin. However, anti-CRT activists discovered a new avenue to achieve their goal — through statewide actions by alarmed legislators, governors, and appointed officials. It has occurred at momentous speed so far. Legislation to stop this harmful racial indoctrination has passed in many states.

A similar statewide strategy should be followed to combat the epidemic of sexual indoctrination in public schools. Legislation to eliminate this sex-ed horror show should be pushed through state legislatures and signed by governors. It should ensure that schools define the family as man, woman, and children, outlaw discussion of sexual topics until at least ninth grade, and prohibit sex or pronoun changes.

While CRT teaches hatred on the basis of skin color, leftist sexual ideology teaches hatred of one’s own body and hatred of the parents who believe in the truth of their child’s God-given body. Not wanting one’s child to see pornographic images in middle school; not wanting one’s children to be indoctrinated to believe they have the power to change their gender and mutilate their healthy bodies; not wanting one’s children coached in the details of anal and oral sex while at school — none of these are the exclusive project of religious conservatives. All will inspire cross-cutting ideological support capable of driving a grassroots movement.

Fighting the left on their radical sexuality agenda is at most hinted at by Republican candidates. But once parents are fully awakened to the dangerous sexualization of children as young as kindergarten, they will be just as horrified as they were by CRT.

Before the lockdowns, more than 80 percent of U.S. children attended public schools. Considering the enormous number of districts that adopted the 2011 standards and the radical left’s push to cancel those who do not bend the knee completely to their agenda, the adoption by states of the new standards is inevitable absent a massive fight to end the sexualization of public school children.

The Death Of Marriage Proves Social Conservatives Were Right About Sex,"New York Times columnist Charles Blow notes that, among adults, married people will soon be a minority in the United States. Blow is fine with this, so he argues for further weakening the incentives to marry. He got some of the facts wrong, but the details matter less than his example of ruling class apathy, or even antipathy, toward marriage.

Marriage is on the rocks in America, and redefining it only seems to be hastening its decline. The redefinition of marriage has not stopped with same-sex relationships. After winning that fight, The New York Times has been enthusiastically pushing polyamory. This means polygamy is back, baby! All it needed was a quick makeover. America’s elite are happy to embrace polygamy—so long as it is relabeled as polyamory and waves the rainbow flag.

This effort is having an effect. Just look at Cambridge, Massachusetts, where the local government voted to recognize domestic partnerships of three or more people. This is not some obscure hippie hamlet, but the home of Harvard University, and the law was developed with the help of the Harvard Law School LGBTQ+ Advocacy Clinic. As coal-mine canaries go, this is a big bird.

All this indicates yet again that the social conservative Cassandras were right in their predictions. During the same-sex marriage debates, LGBT activists professed outrage at the suggestion that polygamy might be next. Now, less than a decade later, they are vigorously pushing us down the slippery slope they insisted didn’t exist. Rod Dreher’s law of merited impossibility has an obvious corollary: “That will never happen, and it will be awesome when it does.”

The sexual revolution’s redefinition of family was never going to stop with same-sex marriage, but few on the left have had the courage to say no to the expansion of the alphabet agenda. People who insisted same-sex marriage would have no effect on the rest of us now want to punish dissenters who don’t want to promote and celebrate same-sex weddings. People who declared this was about consenting adults are now all-in on the LGBT youth agenda, from child drag queens to transgender toddlers.

Americans were promised that LGBT rights were about letting Ellen get married and being nice to Bruce when he wanted to be Caitlyn. Thus, the radical bait-and-switch provides political opportunities for Republicans, if they have the courage to take on the ideologues who control our institutions, from the corporate media to Wall Street. Sen. Tom Cotton, for one, has risen to the challenge by introducing a bill to prohibit schools from concealing children’s gender confusion and transition from parents.

Conservatives can and should run on these issues. But the entrenched powers of our culture are against us, as the embrace of polygamy (sorry, polyamory) in Harvard’s hometown shows. The culture they promote and sustain is anti-marriage, anti-family, and especially anti-child.

Their rolling redefinition of marriage is not rooted in veneration of marriage. After all, advocates for same-sex marriage did not want to make it harder to divorce, and those pushing recognition for poly relationships certainly do not. Rather, they want official recognition for any and all adult romantic relationships and the on-demand dissolution of the same.

This is a consumer model of marriage, in which marriage is an optional capstone to life and a relationship (or, for the polyamorous, relationships). This attitude is bound up in a culture and an economy that are ordered toward adult liberation and indulgence.

Marriage is being remade to fit a culture that encourages people to live as atomized consumers cut off from the past and with no stake in the future. These changes to our understanding of marriage naturally make it seem less important, and unworthy of special status or consideration.

In this view, marriage is a lifestyle choice that can be abandoned at will. But marriage rightly understood is much more. It unites the two halves of the human race into a whole that bridges humanity’s past and future. This requires that marriage be durable, rather than disposable. A society that is not organized to support this kind of marriage is a society that is against children, whatever it might say.

And this is what we see in our culture, where what is best for children is routinely sacrificed to adult desires, interests and fears. Examples are legion, from immense deficit spending to the masking of toddlers to a sexual culture that prioritizes adult indulgence over children’s needs for stable homes with a mother and father. Also, of course, there is the horror of abortion.

Indeed, our nation’s ruling class increasingly displays an anti-natal misanthropy that sees past generations as irredeemably wicked and future generations as a burden. Environmental activists, for example, talk less about the need to protect the planet for future generations than the need to protect it from future generations. These ideas are trickling down, as illustrated in a recent piece by Suzy Weiss on young women who are choosing to be sterilized to ensure that they never have children.

This does illuminate a difference between the traditional practice of polygamy and the fashionable promotion of polyamory. The former encourages powerful men to hoard reproductive opportunities; the latter favors sterility. The old polygamy may cause problems for the long-term stability of a society if too many men are unable to find wives; modern polyamory has no interest in the long-term, for it is all about today.

This transience may suit the interests of the powerful in culture, politics, and finance, but though they can encourage and glamorize this way of life, it remains antithetical to human flourishing. That is best served by stable homes founded on the natural family of a mother, a father, and their children.

Washington Post Reports On Demonic Energy Behind Left's Culture War,"A Halloween-themed profile of a “teenage witch” in The Washington Post over the weekend reads surprisingly like a backhanded affirmation of the Bible and Christianity. It openly connects gender dysphoria with occult experimentation, and both with unsupervised young people going deep into social media rabbit warrens.

I wrote in July about another profile exploring how TikTok promotes multiple personality disorders that approximate demonic possession. The Washington Post article also reinforces the connections between gender confusion and the demonic, immediately by noting that profile subject Viv Bennett “identifies as nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns.”

As I noted in July, the use of plural pronouns for a single individual is eerie considered in light of one of the Bible’s depictions of Christ casting out demons. When addressed, that possessed man also spoke of himself in the plural: “My name is Legion, for we are many.”

It doesn’t stop there. The WaPo article also claims that contemporary witches, mediums, and other would-be consorters with false gods and demons strongly support leftist politics. The most prominently mentioned are no surprise to anyone paying attention: child sacrifice, child mutilation, ritual self-mutilation, and sexual abuse. Or, in other words, abortion and LGBT activism. Here’s the Post:

While Bennett mostly does encouraging, how-to media posts, they [sic] also agree with some witches who feel the label obliges practitioners to be politically outspoken, including on issues regarding the environment and the rights of sexual and gender minorities. Bennett organized a fundraiser with several other occult practitioners running this week to benefit women seeking abortions in Texas, which just passed a highly restrictive law forcing people to pursue the procedure out of state. Bennett and others will hold classes and lectures for a fee, with proceeds going to the Lilith Fund.

According to Wikipedia, Lilith is “a demonic figure in Judaic mythology, supposedly the primordial she-demon. … Commentators and interpreters often envision the figure of Lilith as a dangerous demon of the night, who is sexually wanton, and who steals babies in the darkness.” The Lilith Fund is a Texas-based organization that pays for abortions. “Through organizing and movement-building, we foster a positive culture around abortion,” the outfit says on its website.

It’s not really a surprise that a self-described witch supports child sacrifice, although it is a bit surprising that the Post and the witch are so open about this. Why that is, let’s leave open for speculation.

The Post says this witch, like many other contemporary occult practitioners, also supports child mutilation and sexual abuse (accurate descriptions of what transgender ideology means in real life). How perfectly witchy, and today completely mainstreamed, as the 2021 Halloween Twix commercial underscores.

While they are described benignly as seeking “forgiveness,” “spiritual power,” and “peace,” these practitioners of witchcraft do hate something: Christians. Again, a bit on the nose, isn’t it?

“Bennett is usually nonjudgmental and nuanced, though if a topic touches disrespect of LGBTQ people, or Christian criticism of other spiritualities, an edge can emerge,” Washington Post religion reporter Michelle Boorstein writes in the profile. Fascinating — and, again, something that reflects exactly what the Bible says about spiritual realities.

In tweets accompanying the article, Boorstein reinforced yet again that “political activism is a key part of witchcraft for many practitioners, especially around the environment, LGBTQ equality, and often around poverty, labor rights and other left-leaning causes. … Witches today are deeply discussing issues of identity, appropriation, gender, and colonization.”

And like with society in general, witches today are deeply discussing issues of identity, appropriation, gender and colonization. Witchcraft can mean tapping into as aspect of your own heritage or of another, but witches are debating what's appropriate vs a ""closed"" practice 7/9 — Michelle Boorstein (@mboorstein) October 28, 2021

It’s a bit shocking just how open both the witches and the Washington Post are about depicting the connections between their witchcraft and the left’s culture war. It puts a bead on something I’ve been pondering for a long time, that what is depicted as a political and cultural divide really has roots much deeper. Our divide is spiritual.

That’s also just plain biblical. The Bible flatly declares: “For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.”

The culture war is not about skin color, geographic location, ancestry, income level, or any such comparatively superficial things, but about our hearts, our spiritual allegiances. This war goes right into the deepest parts of our beings and of the universe. It’s typified by whether one will acknowledge any authority over the self, such as the existence of objective truth, truths that are true for all people in all times regardless of their feelings or “experience.” For that’s what worship is: An acknowledgment that one is under an authority.

For Christians, that authority is Christ himself, who is the Word of God. For Satanists — and now leftists more broadly — that authority is the Self. In both literature and religion, Lucifer is defined by denying any authority but his own. While Jesus was defined by His submission to God the Father, Lucifer was defined by his rebellion against God the Father.

This also comes through repeatedly in the Washington Post profile. In another section, Boorstein writes: “Many young Americans are spiritual seekers, it’s just that the places they look for awe and higher truths aren’t necessarily institutions or scriptures but increasingly in nature and in themselves.”

Boorstein also shows the “nonbinary” witch Bennet and a “Florida pagan” friend explicitly acknowledging this on a podcast they host.

Both explain on the episode their spiritual paths, including what they characterize as strongly negative experiences with conservative religion, especially around strict rules and anti-LGBTQ teachings. … ‘No one walks the same path. Even if everyone had the same tradition, everyone will do it their own way,’ says [Bennet’s fellow podcast host] Cuna, who was born into a Cuban Catholic family. ‘There will be some deviation that’s rooted in our own truths. Because that’s honestly what matters in all this: coming back to ourselves.’ ‘Absolutely,’ Bennett says.

That’s not only classically Satan but also a classically Christian depiction of rejecting the true God. Just like the Bible does, then, Boorstein openly connects these witches’ rejection of God with the rejection of his created distinctions between the two sexes and their resulting purposes.

Young Americans in particular are revamping mystical language and ancient rituals for their gender-fluid, write-my-own-rules, insta-worthy world. Like Bennett, many other teens discussing witchcraft these days on social media — the hashtag #witchtok on the youth-oriented site TikTok has 19.4 billion views — are looking for a personalized practice that taps into their own spiritual power and identity and feels authentic.

Even if one puts the Bible aside, to anyone who has read depictions of the demonic in timeless works such Dante’s “Inferno,” the Mephistopheles of “Faust,” and “The Scarlet Letter,” this all still fits right in. The chief characteristic of denying God is the elevation of one’s self to his place — just like Satan.

Not only are these witches fully cognizant of that, they are telling us that their demonic rejection of any God but themselves fits perfectly with today’s political left. This is why the leftist project seeks, for example, to overturn a Constitution and society built on natural law, which insists humans can only find true happiness by living in harmony with and submission to the created order.

The left’s culture war is in fact a religious war. Among other things, that means our politics and culture are only going to get weirder and more clarifying, folks. Best get your armor on and your spiritual swords sharpened.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/11/01/washington-post-reports-on-demonic-energy-behind-the-lefts-culture-war/,2021-11-01
LEAKED: Teachers Talk Subverting Parents To Draw Kids Into LGBT Clubs,"Members of California’s biggest teachers union plotted how to push LGBT politics on children and undermine concerns about their tactics from parents, principals, and communities, reveals leaked audio from an October conference of the California Teachers Association (CTA).

“Speakers went so far as to tout their surveillance of students’ Google searches, internet activity, and hallway conversations in order to target sixth graders for personal invitations to LGBTQ clubs, while actively concealing these clubs’ membership rolls from participants’ parents,” Abigail Shrier reported on Thursday.

Three people from the “2021 LGBTQ+ Issues Conference” in Palm Springs, Calif., titled “Beyond the Binary: Identity & Imagining Possibilities,” sent recordings to Shrier revealing the radical content of some of the workshops.

Multiple seminars at the conference encouraged hosting LGBT clubs for middle schoolers. An audio clip reveals teacher Lori Caldeira explaining why such clubs keep no rosters, noting, “Sometimes we don’t really want to keep records because if parents get upset that their kids are coming? We’re like, ‘Yeah, I don’t know. Maybe they came?’ You know, we would never want a kid to get in trouble for attending if their parents are upset.”

Caldeira has noted in a separate podcast appearance that, in the club she runs that includes other people’s prepubescent minors, “What happens in this room, stays in this room.”

At the CTA conference, Caldeira and another teacher, Kelly Baraki, led an additional seminar about “How we run a ‘GSA’ [Gay-Straight Alliance club] in Conservative Communities,” and discussed their strategies for how to “get the bodies in the door” and ensure kids keep coming back when “we saw our membership numbers start to decline.”

“When we were doing our virtual learning – we totally stalked what they were doing on Google, when they weren’t doing school work. One of them was googling ‘Trans Day of Visibility.’ And we’re like ‘check.’ We’re going to invite that kid when we get back on campus,” Baraki admitted. “Whenever they follow the Google Doodle links or whatever, right, we make note of those kids and the things that they bring up with each other in chats or email or whatever.”

Caldeira also acknowledged that she leverages her role of running morning announcements to further push LGBT ideology on children and their families.

“I’m the one who controls the messaging. Everybody says, ‘Oh, Ms. Caldeira, you’re so sweet, you volunteered to do that.’ Of course I’m so sweet that I volunteered to do that. Because then I control the information that goes home,” she says in one of the recordings. “And for the first time, this year, students have been allowed to put openly LGBT content into our morning announcement slides.”

“The principal, she may flinch, but she [flinches] privately,” Caldeira added.

After Baraki and Caldeira angered parents by using an “anti-bullying” presentation to teach kids what it means to be gay or lesbian, they explained to conference attendees that “Next year, we’re going to do just a little mind-trick on our sixth graders.”

“They were last to go through this presentation and the gender stuff was the last thing we talked about. So next year, they’ll be going first with this presentation and the gender stuff will be the first thing they are about. Hopefully to mitigate, you know, these kind of responses, right?” Baraki continued.

She highlighted the objection of one mom who had hoped to wait before having to talk with her middle school student about sex and gender “identities,” before ridiculing the parent’s reaction.

“I know, so sad, right? Sorry for you, you had to do something hard! Honestly, your twelve-year-old probably knew all that, right?” Baraki said in the leaked conference recording, according to Shrier. She also called it a “win” that another objecting parent had been encouraged to move their child to a private school before boasting that “I have tenure! You can’t fire me for running a GSA. And so, you can be mad, but you can’t fire me for it.”

Neither Baraki, Caldeira, nor the Spreckels Union School District that employs them replied to Shrier’s requests for comment.

"LA Schools Host LGBT Club For 4-Year-Olds, Teach 'Two Spirit' Sexuality","The Los Angeles Unified School District’s Office of Human Relations, Equity and Diversity hosted a 10-week online club for LGBT elementary schoolers, down to four-year-olds. It also prepared a series of presentations that promoted leftwing gender theory and deviant sexualities including the “Two Spirit” sexuality.

The club was called “Rainbow Club,” and met once a week for 10 weeks. It was advertised to students from preschool to fifth grade as a “virtual club for LGBTQ+ elementary school students, their friends, and their grown-ups.”(“TK” stands for transitional kindergarten, for children who are four years old, or preschool age.) The club had its last meeting on November 3, and the advertisement notes the club will restart next semester. The office hosted two similar programs for middle school students and high school students, respectively, including one called the “Middle School Trans & Gender Non Binary Group.”

A different group organized through the LAUSD held a meeting where they hosted Bianca Salevetti, a nurse practitioner from the Children Hospital LA’s Trans Youth Health and Development Department. Salevetti discussed “medical transition and gender care.”

A spokesperson for the LAUSD told The Federalist, “The Rainbow Club is an online meeting for parents and their elementary school-aged children to meet, connect, and talk about topics related to their identities. The goal of the Rainbow Club is to support families of elementary aged children. The meeting is led by clinicians. Participants talk and do art projects.”

When asked why the district has decided to involve itself in the sexual identities of children as young as five years old and if children were required to be accompanied by a parent, the spokesperson refused to comment, responding, “We have nothing beyond the information sent earlier.”

A similar club, titled “Middle School Trans and Gender Non-Binary Group,” was offered for middle schoolers in the district as well.

Public School Promotes Radical Distortions of Sex

The office also created a number of presentations they described as “short, student-facing Push & Play lessons for educators to utilize in their advisory classes.” Several of these presentations pushed leftwing gender theory, including one that even informed students of the “two-spirit” Native American sexuality, which has allegedly “survived centuries of colonial violence and prejudice.”

The presentation includes a video where an individual who goes by “Geo Neptune” complains that European colonizers victimized Native Americans when they “imposed homophobia, rigid binary gender roles, and misogyny,” which he attributes in part to “the Christian tradition.”

The slideshow goes on to ask, “Why do you think the European colonizers worked so hard to eliminate these Indigenous values and traditions?” It concludes by telling students that “the 2 spirit tradition is resilient and precious” and that “it has survived centuries of colonial violence and prejudice.”

One presentation called “Queering Culture” featured an intersectional amalgamation of CRT and leftwing gender theory. One slide provided definitions for the terms “BIPOC” and “LGBTQ2S,” while others discussed William Dorsey Swan, a man from the 1880s who was dubbed “the queen of drag,” and led a “queer resistance group.” The presentation goes on to include a section on intersectionality, asking students to reflect on their racial and sexual identities.

The lesson “LGBT Etiquette” tells students to introduce themselves to each other by using their gender pronouns and teaches that the word “they” can be used to refer to those who consider themselves non-binary. It also features a video from the dating app Tinder, titled “5 Non-binary People Explain What Non-binary means to them.”

The video proposes the acceptance of the non-binary category as a way to upend an allegedly socially constructed perception of sex as a binary distinction between either male or female. One of the speakers in the video even described the belief that there are only two sexes as the product of a “mob mentality.”

Myriad other lessons are provided on the website, including one fawning over Harvey Milk, a noted pederast. There are also presentations on Stonewall, the transgender day of remembrance, bi visibility day, and national coming out day.

Indoctrination Calendars and LGBT Vocab Guides

The term “SOGIE” is listed in numerous places on the website, which stands for “sexual orientation, gender identity and expression.” A SOGIE language handbook is provided, which includes terms like “down low,” which it defines as “men who identify as straight but who secretly have sex with men.”

Then there’s “outing,” which is listed as “men who have sex with men or women who have sex with women, to distinguish sexual behaviors from sexual identities: because a man is straight, it doesn’t mean he’s not having sex with men.” LAUSD also apparently thinks it’s important for staff to know about “top surgery,” or the surgical removal of healthy breasts. The handbook ends with a bang and drifts into the domain of parody, explaining that the pronouns “ze/zir/zee/zerr/zeer” are alternate “gender neutral” pronouns.

The school district, which has recently come under fire for reportedly vaccinating a child in exchange for pizza without parental consent, also promoted a “SOGIE Affirming Practices” list. The list instructed staff to avoid “assuming pronouns” or “hiding your pride.” It also told staff to “work LGBTQ+ topics/themes into curriculum all school year” and to allow “students to use the restrooms/locker room of their affirmed gender,” as well as to “display LGBTQ+ flags, books, posters, etc.”

Then there’s the “Queer All School Year” calendar, which explained different ways teachers can indoctrinate students each month. For December, teachers are told to “Post LGBT-affirming signs in your office, classrooms, and around campus.” In January, teachers are told to “Hold a Jazz and Friends Reading Event and read inclusive books in every grade,” referencing a children’s book titled “I am Jazz,” which focuses on a two-year-old boy who believes he is a girl. A “Black Lives Matter In Schools Week of Action” is advertised for February.

These revelations are also part of an ongoing investigation into the nation’s second-largest school district, which has thus far revealed their hostility to Thanksgiving and multiple instances of them lying about teaching critical race theory.

LGBT Activists Have Been Harassing This Christian Baker For Ten Years,"Jack Phillips is an American. His nation’s supreme law claims to protect his inalienable rights to free speech and to freely practice his faith. Yet for ten years, these same rights have been effectively suspended by a state legislature and multiple courts, despite a 2018 win in the U.S. Supreme Court.

Phillips, who lives in the Denver, Colorado suburb of Lakewood, was first prosecuted for faithful Christianity in 2012. He was hauled into Colorado’s non-judicial Civil Rights Commission, then later into real courts, for offering to sell a gay couple anything in his bakery, Masterpiece Cakeshop, except a custom cake celebrating homosexual acts. He’s still in court now.

His ten-year battle, Phillips said in a Jan. 14 phone interview, “had profound effects on me and my faith. My faith is much stronger now, my family is much closer. First coming out, there were death threats and things, hateful phone calls and emails. There was a time when my wife was afraid to come to the shop because you didn’t know what you would expect.”

In 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court found Phillips was essentially the victim of government entities prejudiced against Christians and other traditional religions, noting the personal hostility expressed against him by commission members.

“Colorado officials compared Jack’s plea for religious freedom to some of the worst things in American history, such as the Holocaust and slavery,” noted Phillips’s current lawyer, Jacob Warner, in a phone interview. Warner works for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which has defended Phillips pro bono in court. “The Supreme Court didn’t need to reach the free speech issue because of that animosity and that left the door open for other litigation.”

Immediately after the Supreme Court decision in Phillips’s first case, LGBT activists hauled Phillips back into court, not once but twice more, again with clear personal animus. In the current case, a lawyer named Autumn Scardina claims the right to force Phillips to draw a picture of Satan smoking marijuana and to bake a cake celebrating transgender mutilation. Not being able to force others into expressing things they don’t believe, Scardina claims, constitutes discrimination against LGBT people.

According to court documents, Scardina has sought for many years to harm Phillips due to his religious beliefs and public stand on their behalf. During trial, for example, Scardina said the goal of this suit was to “correct” the “errors of [Phillips’s] thinking.”

Also during the current case, “Scardina promised Phillips that, were this suit dismissed, Scardina would call Phillips the next day, to request another cake and start another lawsuit,” notes Phillips’s most recent court filing (emphasis original). Court document say Scardina has also harassed Phillips by email, calling him a “bigot” and “hypocrite.”

It’s clear Scardina is using the Colorado court system to continue harassing Phillips for his religious views. Rather than reject this abuse of the legal system against an American’s constitutionally guaranteed rights to freely speak and worship, in March 2021 a Colorado court ruled in Scardina’s favor. Phillips’s case is now in the Colorado Court of Appeals.

“The State’s past prosecutions generated death threats and vandalism and cost Phillips seven years of his life, a significant part of his business, and most of his employees—harms that endure even though he eventually won his legal fights,” notes the defendants’ latest legal briefing in the case. “He’s now been in courts defending his freedom nearly a decade. This crusade against Phillips should stop.”

Phillips’ friends and supporters, who live all over the United States and world, are appalled that our legal system is denying an American his constitutional rights and subjecting him to a decade of prejudiced harassment. They also notice the effects on the cake artist’s everyday life of political activists persecuting him for his Christian beliefs about sex.

Adrian Sherrill, a pastor at Trinity Lutheran Church in Denver, visits Phillips’s shop regularly. Grateful for Phillips’s stand, Sherrill has fixed door handles on Jack’s shop and helped his family move house.

It was during a move that Sherrill particularly noticed Phillips’s van. The 22-year-old trusty delivery vehicle for hundreds of beautiful, custom-made baked goods has approximately 200,000 miles on it. The state-enabled persecution of Phillips and his life’s work has reduced his income, and car prices are now much higher due to high inflation.

So Sherrill and other pastor friends decided to start an online fundraising campaign to get Phillips a new van. They feel it’s the least they can do to support Phillips for standing for all who believe men and women are different, and that no American should be punished for his religious views or forced to labor for someone against his conscience. (Disclosure: This author donated to the campaign.) Sherrill noted that while ADF has handled Phillips’s high-profile legal case at no charge to him, Phillips has still borne significant costs due to his stand, such as lost business and frequent harassment at his shop and elsewhere.

While Jack’s friends and admirers notice the effects of American injustice on Phillips’s life’s work and his family, Phillips responded to questions about his persecution with faith. His ten years and counting legal battle, Phillips said in the interview, “surely has changed the type of business that we do because it’s just a different business now. It’s also the business that God has planned for me from before time. He knew where we would be and what we would be doing. To be doing this is pretty good. I could be wasting my time doing something else, but I don’t think this is a waste of time, I think this is so important. We’re allowed to help people understand that every American should be free to live and work according to their faith.”

“I’ve had people tell me our story has inspired them to make a stand and do the right thing, they’ve thought about, ‘What would the baker do.’ It’s empowered them to do what’s right,” he continued.

Asked if he’s thought about leaving Colorado for a state with a less abusive government, Phillips replied, “No. God put us here, in Lakewood, a suburb of Denver. I’ve been here all my life. This is my home, I grew up two miles from here, so there is no reason for me to go anywhere else. God will provide all we need for this battle here.”

In any case, “There is no place that you could go or place that you should go, because every American should be free to live according to their conscience,” he continued. “That is protected by the First Amendment.”

Or it would be, if U.S. courts enforced the First Amendment. Despite the very visible suggestion that American justice works slowly, if at all, in Phillips’s case, Warner said things are truly looking better for First Amendment enforcement in America.

“ADF has represented creative professionals all over the country and in the past few years we have started to see courts get this right more often than not,” he noted.

Many Americans’ faith in their legal system rests on whether the courts uphold the laws or abuse them. U.S. courts have damaged Americans’ faith by refusing, for example, to rule more broadly on Phillips’s case when the Supreme Court had the chance in 2018, and by writing new law from the bench, as the Supreme Court did in its 2020 Bostock v. Clayton County decision that added gender identity to a law Congress passed when the concept of gender identity didn’t exist.

Phillips’s faith, however, is not in courts or politicians or even in how much money he makes with his extraordinary artistic skills. Phillips’s faith is in the one true God, whose promises never fail, unlike even the promises in the U.S. Constitution that judges often fail to make good.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/01/17/lgbt-activists-have-been-using-courts-to-harass-this-christian-baker-for-ten-years/,2022-01-17
California School District Promotes White Privilege Conference,"Davis Joint Unified School District in Davis, California, pushed leftwing distortions of gender and critical race theory through its Office of School Climate, which taught staff that “gender is a scam” and advertises the White Privilege Conference on March 9-12, 2022.

The office is “responsible for supporting district staff, and recommending and piloting ways to address structural oppression and to enhance school climate, equity, diversity, and inclusion,” according to their website.

The district, which includes approximately 8,500 TK-12 students throughout 16 different schools, also recently voted to adopt an Ethnic Studies requirement, which a press release notes will “explore issues of identity, analyze systems of power” and “examine social movements.”

Distortions Of Gender

The district’s site features a number of different resources that pushed radical leftwing distortions of gender. One presentation called “Supporting LGBTQ+ Students and Staff” was given to staff members at Harper Junior High School in May 2021 by two of the school’s teachers, both of whom use “they/them” pronouns. One also uses the abbreviation “Mx.” in lieu of Mr., Ms., or Mrs.

One slide bore a pride flag with transgender colors and black and brown stripes, both of which “sought to further represent the queer and trans identities of black and brown people.” Another one linked to a video titled “Gender is a Scam,” which compels audiences to “decolonize their language,” while a linked article called “15 Things LGBTQ people of colour want you to know” tells you “why you might be guilty of white fragility.”

The slideshow instructed staff to use the pronouns they/them until someone says his pronouns and told them that “Posters/flags that support LGBTQ+ people are just the beginning” before going on to ask “does your curriculum center primarily white/cis/straight voices?” The same slide warns against using medical and scientifically accurate terminology in regards to gender.

Meanwhile on the office’s LGBTQIA+ Supports page, a link to the activist group Human Rights Campaign promoted “LGBTQ+ Inclusive Picture and Middle School Books,” some of which are even aimed at children in pre-k. A link to the USC Rossier School of Education’s site “Students and Gender Identity Guide for Schools” also features a “Gender Identity Glossary for Schools” with woke vocabulary terms like “deadnaming,” “gender expansive,” “polygender,” “third-gender,” and “two spirit.”

Critical Race Theory and the White Privilege Conference

The office also promotes a trove of critical race theory resources intended for students, families, staff, teachers, and administrators under the subheading “Anti-Bias and Racial Justice.” The site opens by promoting free webinars from EmbraceRace, a left-wing organization aimed at young children. Their webinars bear titles like “Addressing Racial Injustice with Young Children” and “RaceTalk among White Families Post-Floyd. Now What?”

The White Privilege Conference, a project of The Privilege Institute, is also promoted to staff members. The annual conference, not to be confused with the institute’s similarly named White Privilege Symposium, intends to provide “an opportunity for participants to discuss how white privilege, white supremacy, and oppression affects daily life while giving strategies for addressing issues of privilege and oppression and advancing social and economic justice.”

Last year’s conference hosted Robin DiAngelo, who discussed the subject of her latest book “nice racism,” which condemned all white people, including the far-left white people who comprise her audience, as definitionally racist.

The conference featured myriad workshops each day, which boasted titles like “Critical Race Theory/Critical Race Feminism: Creating a Plan of Action during the Biden-Harris era,” “A Good Womyn is Hard to Find,” and “The Making & Remaking of Whiteness.” The institute also hosts the Youth Action Project, with one-day institutes geared towards middle schoolers and high school students.

The district’s office also advertises the 1619 Project curriculum alongside a site called Learning for Justice, which they note “offers excellent, teacher-developed classroom curriculum.”

‘Dismantle White Supremacy’

Included under the heading “For Teachers, Staff, and Administrators” are K-12 frameworks for anti-bias and social justice education from Learning for Justice, a project of the extremist Southern Poverty Law Center whose mission is to “dismantle white supremacy” and “strengthen intersectional movements” by pushing critical race theory into schools.

One such video from The New York Times titled “A Conversation with White People on Race” features white people expressing guilt over their alleged privilege, with one person remarking “We’re all implicated in a racist system, and I play my part in it as a white person.”

The office adds that they have a library of books and videos for staff, including one titled “Cracking the Codes and Mirrors of Privilege: Making Whiteness Visible.”

Meanwhile, students and families are also directed to a number of critical race theory-inspired resources, including one link to a site titled “100 Race-Conscious Things You Can Say To Your Child To Advance Racial Justice,” which includes quotes of things parents have told their children when discussing race.

Particularly striking is number 53, which makes the claim that “if you are White and you commit a crime … police might say ‘that was wrong, don’t do that again,’ and that’s all…but if you are Black and commit the same crime, they might arrest you and you might go to prison.” One quote under the subtitle “police violence” discusses black victims of police brutality, writing “The man who killed them didn’t like brown skin. He had white skin like us.”

The list isn’t exclusively focused on race, however, also promoting left-wing distortions of sex with quotes like “You know, some people are born with penises but feel like girls on the inside and some people are born with vaginas but feel like boys on the inside. We can’t always tell if someone is a boy or a girl just by looking at them and that’s okay.”

“Guidelines for Strong White Allies” is also included on the district’s list. Among the guidelines were requests for “resources,” “money,” and even “your body on the line.” Author Paul Kivel also told “white allies” to “understand and learn from the history of whiteness and racism” and to “assume racism is everywhere, every day.”

An anti-racist book list for children promoted by the district explains how parents can ease children into CRT by first starting “very gently” with entirely unobjectionable books that “just show kids that racial diversity exists.” The goal, however, is to eventually employ books that discuss “racial privilege, colorism, and the subtle tools that uphold white supremacy, such as white fragility and respectability politics.”

The district’s previous superintendent John Bowes signaled his belief in the leftist claim that America is fundamentally racist when, after the conviction of Derek Chauvin, he sent out a message explaining that he was reminded of the need to “rid our country of the systemic bias and institutional racism that exists in all parts of our society.” He went on to explain that “public education, including DJUSD schools, are part of the solution.”

Davis Joint Unified School District’s promotion of both critical race theory and leftist distortions of sex are part of a broader leftwing push in K-12 institutions throughout the country. In California alone, other districts have lied about teaching CRT, hosted LGBT clubs for four-year-olds, paid extremist organizations to “disrupt whiteness,” and promoted material that tells students to use witchcraft against those who say “all lives matter.”

The politicized nature of California’s government schools, along with general concerns regarding quality of education, may lead some to support a recently launched bipartisan campaign to pass a school choice initiative in the golden state.

Catholics For Choice Just Another Left-Wing Front For Abortion Activism,"One day before the 2022 March for Life in Washington, D.C., Catholics For Choice, a radical pro-abortion group, proudly projected “Pro-Choice Catholics You Are Not Alone” and “1 in 4 Abortion Patients is Catholic” messages onto the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.

FACT: 68% of Catholics want #RoeVWade to remain the law of the land. The #MarchForLife & @usccb want folks to think they speak for Catholics, but nothing could be further from the truth.

The left-wing funded group, which has not been Catholic for decades, defended the sacrilegious act by claiming that 68 percent of Catholics “want Roe v. Wade to remain the law of the land.”

CFC’s LGBTQ president, along with other members of the progressive staff, happily amplified the stunt on Twitter. Although many of the CFC staff are openly at odds with Catholic doctrine about contraception, marriage, and gender, the group still claimed to represent a “majority” of Catholics.

Pro-choice Catholics are the majority. Proud to represent them tonight. @Catholic4Choice https://t.co/kQda7pIswp — Jamie L. Manson (@jamielmanson) January 21, 2022

CFC masquerades as a religious group that cares about the health and well-being of women but the organization is just another front for left-wingers that want to fund activism that encourages killing babies in the womb.

The CFC claims to be a “nonprofit organization that lifts up the voices of the majority of Catholics who believe in reproductive freedom,” but the group is actually a front for pro-abortion leftists to push their radical baby-killing agenda under the guise of religion. For decades, the CFC and its pronoun-happy staff have relied on donations from openly left-wing donors to fund their long history of pro-abortion lobbying in the nation’s capital and around the world.

For more than a decade, leftist billionaire Warren Buffett, a self-described agnostic who was raised Presbyterian, has propped up the CFC and its activism by funneling the organization tens of millions of dollars from his foundations. In 2019 alone, Buffett’s Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation gave more than $1,492,000 to Catholics for Choice in the name of promoting abortion-on-demand policies.

The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, a mega-funder for multiple far-left causes and anti-Trumpers posing as Republicans, has also poured millions into CFC in recent years. The Ford Foundation, which maintains sketchy financial ties to communists and terrorist sympathizers, and the Huber Foundation, which is known for giving to radical abortion organizations, have also donated millions to CFC’s cause.

The CFC uses this money that it receives from non-Catholic or Catholic doctrine-denying donors to join forces with other radical pro-abortionists in the United States and even fund advocacy and teachings that encourage killing unborn babies overseas.

CFC was founded in Washington D.C. under the name “Catholics for a Free Choice.” At the time, the nonprofit bragged it was designed “to serve as a voice for Catholics who believe that the Catholic tradition supports a woman’s moral and legal right to follow her conscience in matters of sexuality and reproductive health.”

Despite CFC’s insistence that its radical pro-abortion views line up with modern religious feelings, the Catholic Church officially opposes abortion and teaches that life must be protected starting at conception. According to The Catechism of the Catholic Church, Catholics have officially “affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion” since the first century.

“This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law,” the catechism states.

The pope also has said that abortion, which the CFC touts as “protecting women,” is “murder.”

Additionally, despite the church’s firm position against LGBTQ acts, most of CFC’s current staff are openly gay, actively allied with LGBTQ activism, or have pronouns in their staff bios.

As a result of the CFC’s immoral teachings, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, then called the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, excommunicated the CFC in 1993 and said the group was not “an authentic Catholic organization.”

“It attracts public attention by its denunciations of basic principles of Catholic morality and teaching — denunciations given enhanced visibility by media outlets that portray CFFC as a reputable voice of Catholic dissent,” the NCCB wrote in a statement.

The Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Archdiocese of Mexico also censured the organization and noted that the CFC’s primary mission is antithetical to Catholic teaching.

In addition to losing its official status as a Catholic organization in the 1990s, CFC has also earned the wrath of several high-ranking Catholic officials over the years who don’t take the nonprofit’s endorsement of the immoral act of abortion lightly.

During the 2022 March for Life, Cardinal Wilton Gregory, the archbishop of Washington D.C., compared CFC to Judas Iscariot, the disgraced disciple who betrayed Jesus. After the CFC displayed pro-abortion messages on the National Basilica ahead of the March for Life, Gregory said the group excommunicated themselves by supporting baby-killing in the womb.

“The true voice of the Church was only to be found within The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception last evening. There, people prayed and offered the Eucharist asking God to restore a true reverence for all human life,” Gregory wrote.

“Those whose antics projected words on the church building demonstrated by those pranks that they really are external to the Church and they did so at night – John 13:30,” he added.

Archbishop Salvatore Cordilene, head of the Archdiocese of San Franciso, also condemned CFC’s “attempted desecration,” and called it “diabolical.”

While the CFC has failed to gain the approval of the Catholic church, it has earned high praise from abortion activists and baby-killing organizations such as Planned Parenthood, which boosted the CFC’s early efforts to advertise and promote abortion.

Christian School In Dallas Hosts Racially Segregated School Clubs,"Documents obtained by The Federalist reveal that Parish Episcopal School, an elite private school in Dallas, Texas, hosted racially segregated school clubs and targeted a student who objected. One faculty member with power over school curriculum has also expressed extreme anti-cop and anti-white sentiments, and the school has ties to far-left organizations.

Not to be confused with the Episcopal School of Dallas, a neighboring private school that The Federalist revealed has been lying to parents about the presence of racism in its classrooms, Parish Episcopal School costs nearly $20,000 for PreK and more than $30,000 for middle and high school.

A flyer from the school explains the purpose and nature of the racially segregated student groups, called “affinity groups.” It notes that the groups are open to “all upper school students” before going on to insist the groups remained racially segregated, saying “we only ask that you respect that if you do not identify as the members of that group, please do not attend that meeting group.”

Affinity groups were hosted for a number of races and sexual behaviors, including for Hispanic and African American students, as well as for those who identify as LGBTQ+. An affinity group was also hosted for white students, and was labeled “White Allies for Racial Equity.”

Racially segregated school clubs are only one of the numerous outgrowths of the leftwing orthodoxy that dominates the school.

Even trivial topics have become marred by woke identity politics. Chris Anderson, PES’s assistant head of middle school for student life, sent out an email addressing an upcoming Hawaiian-themed school spirit day. In it, he said the day “did not align with our commitment of creating a culture of belonging.”

He went on to tell students to not wear flower leis, flower headbands, grass skirts, or anything else that “would be considered insensitive to Native Hawaiians or the Hawaiian culture.”

Students Subjected To Indoctrination Seminar

More recently, high school students at PES were subjected to a half-day leftwing indoctrination seminar. It featured sessions including “LGBTQ-101: Pronouns and Why They Matter” which covered “terminology associated with the LGBTQ community, non-binary and transgender identities, bullying, and cultural competency.”

Another session called “Healthy Masculinity” discussed “examples of how media and peer groups enforce both healthy and toxic masculinity will be looked at and discussed.”

Despite its clear political bias, an email advertising the seminar mentioned only the tamer aspects of the conference.

Teacher Condemns All White People As Racists, Says ‘F-ck The Police‘

While the school’s diversity statement claims the institution cultivates “respect for the rich variety of people and points of view that exist in our complex global society,” remarks from social studies teacher Jania Hoover suggest such respect may be lacking not only among the school’s administration, but among faculty as well.

Hoover condemned both police officers and those who support them in a post where she exclaimed “F-ck the police” (profanity altered for publication). She followed up the vitriolic statement with more hatred, saying “If you believe the police are good because YOU know a good one, f-ck you too.”

In addition to anti-police bias, the teacher also has publicly expressed anti-white bias. In one post reflecting on a conference she attended called Be About It, Hoover condemned all white people as racist, noting that “Even well-meaning white people are complicit in racism and white supremacy.” She also states, “I was wary when I saw white people hosting, but most of the speakers are black.”

Hoover isn’t just a teacher at Parish Episcopal School. The institution has trusted her to develop curriculum as a subject area coordinator. In her role, she’s worked alongside the school’s Diversity Committee, according to her resume. That resume also says she has a doctorate in education.

Hoover also openly said she was preparing to teach critical race theory to her students, noting that she was doing so specifically because CRT had come under fire.

Hoover made good on her commitment to teaching the divisive theory. A slide from Hoover also reveals a QR code that leads to a document that lists several CRT resources that Hoover uses in class.

One such resource is the Zinn Education Project, named after Howard Zinn, a Marxist academic and activist. Another is Liberate History, which provides teachers with lesson plans that are explicitly grounded in CRT.

Yet another is Teaching Tolerance, a project of the activist Southern Poverty Law Center, which has been renamed Learning for Justice. It also seeks to embed CRT in America’s schools.

School Teams Up With Far-Left Organizations

In an email sent out the week of the 4th of July, Monaco decried his alleged privilege while also saying that his celebration of Independence Day came with “a pang of discomfort.”

He also went on to implore parents to read a report published by the school in 2019 titled “We Are Parish: Building a Culture of Belonging.” It described the leftward direction that the school intended to take, complete with anti-bias training and the “diversification” of choosing people according to skin color for the school’s administration, faculty, staff, and board. It also included a glossary with terms like “asexual,” “microaggression,” “LGBTQAAI,” and “privilege.”

Most notably, the report discussed PES’s partnership with or general interest in a variety of left-wing organizations, including the aforementioned Teaching Tolerance. Another organization the Christian school looked to as it sought to modify its curriculum was GSLEN, which works to endanger women by advocating for men who identify as transgender to be able to use women’s restrooms.

GSLEN also organizes LGBT clubs on K-12 campuses and hosts events celebrating transgenderism. The organization even published a guide intended for minors for changing one’s name during transgender transition. This same document promoted a number of unhealthy ways to address children’s gender dysphoria.

Multiple representatives of the Anti-Defamation League were also consulted as Parish plotted its move to the left. While the ADL posits itself as an authority on racial hatred, it defines racism as “The marginalization and/or oppression of people of color based on a socially constructed racial hierarchy that privileges white people,” a politically motivated definition that reinforces the anti-white idea that white people cannot be victims of racial hatred.

The Parish Episcopal School also made these changes despite recognizing in its report that previous identity-based programming events were criticized as “agenda-laden and shaming” by some “non-minority members of the Upper School community.”

School Condemns One Of Its Own Students

Here’s how one student was treated by the school’s leadership when he took a vocal stand against identity politics by selecting a statement from Theodore Roosevelt as his senior quote.

It read, “In this country we have no place for hyphenated Americans,” a clear display of a belief in a unifying American identity that cuts across the racial fault lines the left has so effectively seized upon. The quote was originally approved by the school, and, as the student later explained, was not motivated by animosity.

Following outrage from some students, the administration mercilessly attacked their own student, issuing a letter of condemnation signed by Monaco that decried the high school senior’s selected quote as ethnically and racially insensitive and “inarguably offensive.”

It even went on to announce that the administration had launched an investigation into the situation and that the school “does not condone any sort of hate or bias act.” The quote was taken off of social media and did not appear in the yearbook, in a move that not only caved into politically motivated demands but also legitimized an attack on the expression of their own student.

A Cross-Sector Crisis

While much of the conversation about critical race theory has been relegated to government-run schools, the state of Parish Episcopal School, just like that of the Episcopal School of Dallas, proves that the effort to indoctrinate America’s youth is broad. Both schools are associated with the leftwing National Association of Independent Schools.

This dynamic highlights the importance of parents fighting back against any educational institution that has dedicated itself to the indoctrination of students. It also underscores that destructive far-left ideology affects the entire education sector, as well as extending far outside government institutions.

Another Unhinged Professor Has Been Exposed As A Pedophilia Apologist,"This article contains obscene quoted material.

It’s been less than two months since an associate professor teamed up with a pro-pedophile organization in an attempt to normalize the most repugnant crimes imaginable. Now, yet another unhinged professor has been caught advocating for pedophilia, this time even more brazenly.

Stephen Kershnar is a professor at State University of New York at Fredonia, and a pedophilia apologist.

Here’s Kershnar on video saying that an adult male having sex with a 12-year-old girl is not obviously wrong, and that calling it wrong is a “mistake.” In the same clip, he refers to pedophilic rape as “adult-child sex,” another euphemism that, just like “minor-attracted person,” is being used in an attempt to run cover for evil.

It gets worse. Twelve isn’t young enough for Kershnar. He continues to defend pedophilia, remarking “The notion that it’s wrong even with a one-year-old is not quite obvious to me.” He goes on. “I don’t think it’s blanket wrong at any age.”

It just keeps getting worse! @FredoniaU this guy needs to be fired ASAP pic.twitter.com/mgOi1spSxt — Libs of Tik Tok (@libsoftiktok) February 2, 2022

Kershnar even argues that children can consent to sex with adults, comparing it to a child willfully engaging in kickball or participating in bar mitzvah lessons.

What are the legal ramifications of such an unspeakably vile perspective? Kershnar lays it out. Since he’s not sure if raping infants is good or bad, “the thumb on the scale should go to liberty.” Liberty for who? Moral monsters who want to rape infants.

Kershnar is open to the idea that pedophilia is deeply harmful to victims, but he just can’t put his finger on why. He thinks it could be because of bigots like you and me, who go “berserk” when pedophiles rape kids.

He even argues that we often make children do things they don’t want to do, like “go to church” or “go to temple” or “go to their sister’s ballet recital.” His perspective is backed up by podcast host Thaddeus Russel, who makes an equally monstrous argument when he says “all a child’s life is, is coercion by adults … often to make the child do something for the adult’s pleasure only.”

It’s also telling that these dangerous viewpoints have found their way into the mainstream through left-wing outlets. At one point, Russel boasts that he authored an article in The Daily Beast that argued for lowering consent laws.

If SUNY Fredonia would like to right this wrong, it can begin by correcting Kershnar’s bio, which adopts the language of child groomers by calling pedophilia “adult-child sex.”

Thus far, SUNY Fredonia’s response has been swift, although incomplete. In a statement, the university remarked that Kershnar’s views are “reprehensible and do not represent the values of SUNY Fredonia in any way, shape or form” also noting that “The matter is being reviewed.”

Only one moral decision can be made following such a review. Half measures, or any other move to placate those who are correctly outraged at the situation rather than remedy the crisis, are entirely unacceptable and unbecoming of any institution that hopes to maintain a shred of legitimacy.

Although SUNY Fredonia may in fact come to the correct decision, it must be recognized that these sentiments did not come out of nowhere. The institution is responding to a high-profile case that’s just now been exposed.

Some of the school’s alumni weren’t the least bit surprised. After all, we’re talking about a professor who published a book titled “Pedophilia and Adult-Child Sex: A Philosophical Analysis” all the way back in 2015. That SUNY at Fredonia is only now responding to this moral crisis in response to public outcry is disgraceful and deceptive.

Kershnar Is Not Alone

When hearing about such an outrageous situation, it can be easy to believe that it is an isolated experience, that such insane notions couldn’t possibly have taken root elsewhere. Unfortunately, this would be a misconception.

As mentioned previously, it hasn’t been long since a former professor at Old Dominion University rebranded pedophiles as “minor-attracted persons.” Even this instance was not unique.

A professor at Yale University by the name of Joe Fischel publicly argued that children should be shown nudity, thereby victimized by acts of indecent exposure, at LGBT pride parades. His article was replete with the same strategies that child groomers use, as I outlined previously.

These handful of pedophilia apologist professors are just the tip of the iceberg, one facet of a wider campaign to normalize pedophilia. The logical results of these sentiments have trickled down into K-12 institutions, with gay pornography being featured in school libraries, while other government-run schools host LGBT clubs for four-year-olds, all while refusing to reveal if parents were required to be present on these clubs’ Zoom calls.

The crisis isn’t relegated to education, either, with similar themes popping up in a number of totally different sectors. A commercial from Twix featured child cross-dressing, just one more example of the elite attempt to groom children.

A YMCA’s LGBT center hosts youth-only events, and hosted a man who creates drawings that feature characters from children’s shows having sex. Meanwhile, a broader push to foist transgenderism on children has a dark and storied history of pedophilia, child abuse, and psychological torment.

Make no mistake, there is a broad and deliberate push in nearly all areas of public life to normalize pedophilia. This push must be fought wherever it is found, without reservation.

Here’s How To Fight Pedophilia’s Normalization

Let’s be abundantly clear: this is not a complicated issue. In fact, there can be no simpler issue. Pedophilia is evil. That’s it. We shouldn’t accept the notion that pro-pedophilia sentiments are valid ideas to be contended with in the marketplace of ideas by the use of rhetorical flourish or superior philosophizing.

Illiberalism is no crime when your opponent uses bad-faith arguments to justify moral atrocities that target the most vulnerable among us, victimizing them in ways they can’t even comprehend.

These ideas, just like those who use their institutional positions to normalize this horrid evil, must be ostracized, shamed, shunned, stigmatized, and mocked out of any and all forms of socio-political or academic influence. This is not extreme. It’s the natural immune system response that any healthy society enacts when confronted with a rising tide of danger and evil.

Here are some simple ways you can reject it:

Refuse to use euphemistic and manipulated language.

By using euphemisms, you fight the battle against child groomers on their terms. You must completely reject phrases like “minor-attracted person,” or “adult-child sex,” both of which seek to grant sympathy and dignity to these atrocities and those who commit them. Maintain the moral high ground with terms that accurately identify evil.

Become comfortable with being intolerant.

Tolerance is a vice, not a virtue, when you are asked to tolerate unspeakable moral crimes. Our society has begun to see tolerance as the mark of an enlightened person. Reject this faulty framing, and all the degeneracy and spiritual rot that has followed closely behind it.

Fight, fight, fight.

If there was ever a time to be uncompromising, to cling to your beliefs with unrelenting zeal, this is it. The only proper response to situations such as this is action backed by righteous anger. Root out attempts to normalize pedophilia anywhere and everywhere you find it. Publicize it. Send examples like this to The Federalist. Demand that institutions that are home to these sentiments condemn it wholeheartedly in speech and in action. Fight, fight, fight.

Red State Public Schools Push Kids To Go Trans Behind Parents' Backs,"While Idaho is considered a refuge for people fleeing Democrat-controlled areas, a new report shows the state’s supermajority Republican legislature has not protected children from far-left politics in public schools, including state-sponsored racism and hiding transgender ideation from childrens’ parents.

Report authors Anna Miller and Dr. Scott Yenor note that the kind of extremist ideology affecting kids in blue and purple states is also metastasizing within small-town and rural public schools in locales that faithfully vote Republican.

“School administrators in Coeur d’Alene manipulated an 11-year-old girl into believing she was a boy and should undergo gender transition surgery,” Miller writes in a study overview in The American Mind. “The elementary school counselor had coached the young girl into believing she was transsexual and instructed her how to tell her parents about her new identity. According to a recorded phone call between the counselor and parent, the principal and other school officials had known about this and began calling the girl by a boy’s name while purposefully choosing not to inform the child’s parents.”

Coeur d’Alene has a population of approximately 54,000, according to census data. It’s in rural north Idaho, within commuting distance to Spokane, Washington. It’s a conservative lumber, manufacturing, and health-care town surrounded by mountains and lakes. People live there to enjoy the classic American way of life, but their public schools work to undermine that way of life with public resources, in the absence of effective oversight from elected officials.

Leftist morality that undermines the beliefs and desires of a majority of Idaho’s citizens is rampant throughout the Republican-run state’s education systems, says Miller and Yenor’s recently released report for the Idaho Freedom Foundation and Claremont Institute’s Center for the American Way of Life: “Things that were unthinkable five or 10 years ago now are everyday practices in public schools across America.”

Many Idahoans have “the sense that Idaho is immune from these disturbances,” the report notes. “Our school districts seem responsive and responsible. Our laws emphasize conservative values. We have Republican supermajorities… There may be an Idaho difference, but the difference is not what people think. Idaho is uniquely complacent about the trends that people in other states see.”

Putting Explicit Sexual Info In Kids’ Hands

One of the most visible ways many Idaho public schools push extremism common to far-left locales is in exposing kids to adult sexual practices and gender ideology, often without parent knowledge or consent.

For example, a “socioemotional learning” curriculum “used in many school districts statewide including Coeur d’Alene, Pocatello-Chubbuck, and West Ada … encourages students to question their sexual orientation and gender, be activists for issues such as transgenderism, and use the website LoveIsRespect.org for sex advice. The website includes resources such as ‘Five tips for your first time,’ refers places to get an abortion, and promotes sexual taboos like polyamory,” the report notes.

Being a red state offers little, if any, refuge from sexual voyeurism in schools, the report notes: “data suggests that LGBTQ-affirming curricula are widely available in Idaho’s education system. They estimate 31% of Idaho’s middle schoolers and 51% of high schoolers are taught about sexual orientation and similar numbers are taught about ‘gender identity’ and ‘gender expression.’ Similarly, the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network’s (GLSEN) data show 12% of schools teach curriculum promoting the LGBTQ agenda and 47% of school libraries provide students with LGBTQ-related resources,” Miller writes in The American Mind.

Idaho public schools spread such sexual ideology despite state laws requiring schools “to teach abstinence and provide factual, medically accurate and objective information.” The report details how even though several state laws attempt to restrain public schools from exposing children to pornographic and politicized sexual details, many teachers ignore the laws’ text and clear intent.

Teachers Are Deliberately Trained to Teach Racism

Idaho’s education system also heavily subsidizes the racial grievance industry with public funds, starting with teacher training and certification, the report notes. Idaho’s state board of education adopted certification rules common to 18 states that require teachers to develop “culturally responsive teaching. ” These Interstate Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium rules “cite Gloria Ladson-Billings’s definition of culturally responsive teaching. She is known for introducing critical race theory to education,” the report notes.

To be certified to teach in Idaho, teachers and other school personnel are thus required to “reflect on personal and cultural biases” “to broaden and deepen his/her own understanding of cultural, ethnic, gender, and learning differences.” To be certified as a “culturally responsive educator” under these requirements, “Two key practices include the rejection of colorblindness and replacing instruction about facts with narrative stories,” the report notes.

In Idaho, this has resulted in the same anti-American and racially biased lessons parents have exposed across the nation. For one example, “iCivics curriculum used in Boise School District’s Third Grade Citizenship unit teaches children that NFL players kneeling in protest at the playing of the national anthem is a sign of civic engagement, rather than disrespect to the country.”

This also results in Idaho churning out teachers who are trained to ignore and undermine any legal restraints on such highly politicized and socially destructive teaching.

“Teachers arrive in schools steeped in teaching techniques designed to dismantle traditional culture, reject colorblindness, adopt social constructivist views of truth and culture, and promote anti-racism. Teacher training reinforces and expands these early efforts. Education nonprofits offer curriculum and programming packages to school districts and principals to bring these elements and techniques into the daily experience of the classroom,” the report says.

Avoiding Parental and Legislative Oversight

Systematically sidelining parent and legislative oversight is another theme of Idaho’s education system, the report finds: “the anti-competitive nature of the public school system allows a small, politically organized group of incumbents to maintain a monopoly on the ideas taught in schools.”

“At the most fundamental level, Idaho’s education system is designed to replace the influence of parents on the opinions and sentiments of children with the influence of public institutions,” the authors write. “Our public education system emphasizes the principles of [critical social justice], a false and harmful anti-American, anti-Christian ideology that sows racial hatred, gender confusion, and resentment. There is no making peace with this imperial ideology. It must either be rooted out of our system (a tall task) or parents must be assisted in walking away from the system.”

Because education’s entire infrastructure has been run for a century by people who pledge allegiance to leftist ideologies that aim to destroy the American way of life, bans on teaching critical race theory or explicit sexual acts have very limited effects, says the report. This means other means are needed to truly end the left’s political weaponization of education funds.

“The effort to ‘ban’ CRT may have roused public support and action among parents to reform the system, but it does very little to fundamentally reform the system,” the authors note. “…It is not possible to establish a ‘neutral’ school system. Those with political power will always teach their beliefs in exclusion of others. Legislators must decide who should be given primary control over the schools and the next generation, get out of the business of banning, and start demanding.”

The report authors therefore recommend lawmakers distribute education funds directly to parents, instead of corrupted education institutions that have shown themselves impervious to a century of reform efforts. This would also relieve U.S. public education’s systemic discrimination against religious families that currently bans children from instruction fully integrated with their faith as a condition of receiving public dollars.

“School choice would allow people to select education options compatible with their religious beliefs and backgrounds, rather than requiring them to fight for control over the public education system,” the report says.

It also recommends rejecting federal grants, letting charter schools construct their own teacher certification pathways, making all instruction materials public, barring schools from using public dollars to pay for racist instruction, and replacing the state’s Common Core curriculum mandates.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/02/07/report-red-state-public-schools-encourage-kids-to-go-transgender-behind-their-parents-backs/,2022-02-07
YouTube Bans LGBT People From Finding Effective Treatment For Trauma,"I’m a clinical psychologist, and I help my clients resolve their traumatic memories. In the process, these clients often report spontaneous changes in their sexual feelings, and these changes may lead them away from LGBT attractions and toward heterosexual ones.

I’m not alone in observing this. A two-year study with a good sample size revealed the same thing. So I talked about this study on my YouTube channel.

This turned out to be a mistake. Big Tech, at the behest of left-wing activists, decided to censor information about sexual shifts that move any client on the sexuality spectrum away from “gay” and toward “straight.” These outcomes, which would be celebrated if they moved a client the other direction, which can be life-transforming results for some people.

Human sexuality is complex, and is changed by our life experiences. Working through traumatic experiences, such as childhood sexual molestation and peer labeling, can trigger dramatic changes in a person’s sexual identity.

I work regularly with victims of past trauma who report emotional distress, depression, and suicidal thoughts. Unfortunately, a subsection of these clients live with a political “hot button” issue that makes them anathema to activists in our society: they have same-sex attractions that they believe do not reflect “who they are.” These men have long suspected that events in their past have affected their sexuality.

My practice has found, through science-based, client-led therapy, that some men can make shifts along the sexual-fluidity spectrum—not just regarding their attraction to people of the same sex, but towards being attracted to women.

Last month, The Hill gave a platform to activists who declared Reintegrative Therapy—the work my practice developed and which we use every day— to be “hateful” and “harmful.” They cited a report by the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), which is run by people who used to work for the far-left Southern Poverty Law Center. The GPAHE campaign explicitly works to pressure tech media companies to remove content on unwanted same-sex attraction.

In response to these reports, YouTube permanently banned my account of research showing the harm reduction gained through Reintegrative Therapy. In doing so, YouTube has cut off sexual-abuse victims from learning about alternatives for their lives and sexuality. I have reposted the videos on Odysee so the thousands of people who have found these videos helpful can continue to search, find, and use them.

The study I mentioned above was peer-reviewed and published in the Journal of Human Sexuality. Its independent researchers determined that the approach I use, which focuses on resolving traumatic memories, is associated with decreases in psychological distress, such as decreases in depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation.

It will often, but not always, measurably reduce unwanted sexual behaviors as a spontaneous byproduct. In other words, clients often experience a shift in sexual attraction as a byproduct of dealing with their past trauma. Identical methods are used by Reintegrative Therapy in the treatment of binge-eating disorders.

This treatment method is distinct from the much-maligned (and sometimes legally banned) “conversion therapy,” as it does not seek to change a client’s sexuality. Change, when it occurs, is a byproduct of the resolution of trauma.

I actually agree with SPLC’s discredited alums that abusive therapies should be banned. That is good for society as a whole, and it is good for individuals who may confuse abusive practices with licensed, qualified help.

Unfortunately, Big Tech, Big Media, and LGBT activists have gone overboard. They risk “throwing the baby out with the bathwater” by denying clients whose values and worldview are different from their own from learning about effective therapies.

Objective science doesn’t care about political agendas. Everyone should put those seeking help first, now and always.

The Studies Cited To Support Gender-Bending Kids Are Junk Science,"The transgender misinformation machine is at it again. The New York Times recently published an extensive essay arguing against screening before medical transition — if someone says she wants hormones or surgery, doctors should immediately break out the syringes and prep the operating room.

The article, by Alex Marzano-Lesnevich of Bowdoin College, exemplifies how the transgender movement uses misinformation to advance its agenda. Marzano-Lesnevich asserts, “That gender-affirming health care saves lives is clear: A 2018 literature review by Cornell University concluded that 93 percent of studies found that transition improved transgender people’s heath [sic] outcomes, while the remaining 7 percent found mixed or null results. Not a single study in the review concluded negative impact.”

That seems dispositive — unless you look at the studies. The cited literature review was titled the “What We Know Project” and was directed by the LGBT scholar and activist Nathaniel Frank, who cited it in his own New York Times piece on transgenderism a few years ago, writing that “Our findings make it indisputable that gender transition has a positive effect on transgender well-being.”

Poorly Conducted Studies

These proclamations that the science is settled are a bold facade on rickety scaffolding. When this New York Times article invokes the authority of science, it seeks to evoke the image of careful statisticians sifting through data collected by diligent doctors.

But it is actually appealing to self-selected online surveys with cash prizes, studies with tiny samples, and studies that are missing more than half of their subjects. Stacking a bunch of weak studies on top of each other doesn’t provide a strong result, but The New York Times presumes readers won’t bother to check the details — the editors certainly didn’t.

Back in 2019, I took a closer look at the studies the What We Know Project cites, and found a methodological mess. Many of the studies had serious flaws, beginning with small sample sizes. As I noted, “Of the fifty relevant papers identified by the project, only five studies (10 percent) had more than 300 subjects, while twenty-six studies (52 percent) had fewer than 100. Seventeen studies (34 percent) had fifty or fewer subjects, and five of those had a sample size of twenty-five or less.”

The flaws extended far beyond small sample size, and the largest studies tended to be the weakest, often consisting of little more than online surveys with a self-selecting sample. Nor should we put much faith in a study that recruited subjects for an online survey by advertising “on online groups and discussion forums that were dedicated to FTM [female-to-male] members. . . . Upon survey completion, participants were entered into a lottery drawing for cash prizes.”

Even the better-designed long-term studies were often plagued by poor response rates. A European study had 201 out of 546 respond — just 37 percent. And though missing data is, by definition, missing, it is reasonable to suspect that those with poor outcomes are overrepresented among those who could not or would not respond.

Regret Rates

Nor did The New York Times check Marzano-Lesnevich’s claim that “gender-affirming health care has some of the lowest rates of regret in medicine. A 2021 systemic review of the medical literature, covering 27 studies and 7,928 transgender patients, found a regret rate of 1 percent or less.” But read the paper and it is quickly apparent both that the review has significant weaknesses and that The New York Times allowed its conclusions to be misrepresented.

Of the 27 studies used in their analysis, the review authors ranked only five as “good” and only four as having a low risk of bias. Many of the studies had the same flaws as those examined in the What We Know Project (indeed, some studies were used in both).

Another problem is that the majority of the data in the 2021 review came from a single study conducted by a Dutch group retrospectively examining the records of their own gender clinic. But a retrospective review of medical files will only identify regrets from patients who shared them with the gender clinic that performed their surgeries. Furthermore, the study only identified regrets following gonadectomy, and not those who regretted other surgeries, or who never had surgery but did regret taking cross-sex hormones or puberty blockers.

In addition to the problem of allowing a flawed data set to dominate the 2021 review, this illustrates another persistent difficulty with studies of transgender regret, which is that they are often conducted by those who provide medical transition, rather than independent researchers. People whose livelihoods and reputations depend on facilitating medical transition might be less than diligent and rigorous in looking for regret.

To their credit, the authors of the 2021 review do discuss some of the limits and difficulties of their work, writing that various problems:

represent a big barrier for generalization of the results of this study. The lack of validated questionnaires to evaluate regret in this population is a significant limiting factor. In addition, bias can occur because patients might restrain from expressing regrets due to fear of being judged by the interviewer. Moreover, the temporarity of the feeling of regret in some patients and the variable definition of regret may underestimate the real prevalence of ‘true’ regret.

None of these qualifications regarding regret were even hinted at in the published column. Despite The New York Times’ citing it, the 2021 review does not prove that “gender-affirming health care has some of the lowest rates of regret in medicine.”

As the authors note, regret is not only an imperfect measure, but it is often difficult to measure, with no set criteria defining it. In one Swedish review cited by the What We Know Project, it was defined “as application for reversal of the legal gender status among those who were sex reassigned,” which excludes those who succumbed to depression or addiction, or who lived unhappily after transition without seeking to legally detransition.

Gatekeeping before Transition

Furthermore, even if we uncritically accept the results of the 2021 review, it does not support the argument that gatekeeping before medical transition is unnecessary and harmful. Rather, the authors claim that the low regret rate they found “reflects and corroborates the increased [sic] in accuracy of patient selection criteria for GAS [gender affirmation surgery].”

In short, the review argues that medical gatekeeping keeps regret rates low. That The New York Times allowed this review to be used as evidence against medical screening, and in favor of self-ID for medical transition, exemplifies the persistent practice of American transgender activists using studies of (mostly) carefully screened European adults to argue against screening before medical transition, even for children.

Unfortunately, the aggregation of (often questionable) studies, and the exaggeration of their conclusions by activists, is only part of the problem. These efforts to spread misinformation are augmented by the intimidation of dissenting scientists and the suppression of results that trans activists dislike.

Suppressing Dissent

Researchers have learned to fear the wrath of LGBT activists, and take pains to avoid it. Results that undermine the narrative have to be carefully presented lest the public draw the wrong conclusions. Thus, when scientists concluded that there is no “gay gene” they “worked with LGBTQ advocacy groups and science-communication specialists on the best way to convey their findings in the research paper and to the public.”

With regard to transgender ideology, the intimidation is even more overt. For example, Lisa Littman’s qualitative study describing the phenomenon of rapid-onset gender dysphoria met a ferocious response from transgender activists. Similarly, activists smeared Canadian psychologist Kenneth Zucker and forced him out of his position as the leader of a gender identity clinic, even though he sometimes supported transitioning children. He was just more cautious about it than activists wanted. He was eventually vindicated, but targeting him still sent a warning to any researchers who are seen as insufficiently pro-trans.

As these cases demonstrate, the science is being manipulated to fit transgender ideology. Shoddy studies — often conducted by activists and doctors with a stake in medical transition — are boosted if they support the trans narrative, while results and researchers who challenge it are suppressed. This skewed data is then used by trans activists and their allies to shape the discourse.

Uncomfortable facts and stories are kept out of the official narrative. Insightful and moving first-person accounts of transition and detransition are confined to non-traditional outlets such as Substack, as are the warnings of leading trans doctors about the reckless rushing of children into transition. The information bubble is the point.

Going forward, disagreement will be labeled “misinformation” and banned from social media, and dissidents will be labeled as bigots who should be fired from their jobs. Doctors will be required to practice only according to the approved narrative, and educators will encourage children to transition without parental knowledge and consent. Worse still, the government will take children from parents who do not support transition.

The purpose of the transgender misinformation machine is not so much to persuade, but to provide justification for coercion. The point of the lies and distortions is to impose transgender ideology on all of us, especially children.

Disney Executives Admit: Of Course We’re Grooming Your Children,"Disney isn’t just grooming children with radical sexual propaganda — now they’re bragging about it.

On the heels of Florida’s new Parental Rights in Education law, which bars educators from instructing kindergarten through third-grade students about sexual ideology, multiple executives and employees from the Walt Disney Company admitted their own personal missions to deluge 5- to 9-year-olds with as much of their own sexual ideology as possible.

One Disney executive boasted about her “not-at-all-secret gay agenda” and efforts at “adding queerness to” children’s programming, in leaked audio published by investigative journalist Chris Rufo on Tuesday.

“Our leadership over there has been so welcoming to my, like, not-at-all-secret gay agenda,” said Latoya Raveneau, an executive producer for Disney Television Animation. “I was just, wherever I could, just basically adding queerness … No one would stop me and no one was trying to stop me.”

Rufo ⚔️ (@realchrisrufo) March 29, 2022

“Something must have happened in the last — they are turning it around, they’re going hard,” Raveneau noted. On Monday, Disney vowed to keep fighting Florida’s new law, after speaking out against the bill before Gov. Ron DeSantis signed it (though Disney’s activism was not enough to satisfy a handful of employees enraged that the Mouse didn’t do more).

Another Disney employee, production coordinator Allen March, was caught in a video call advertising a “tracker” he uses to meet self-imposed quotas for LGBT characters in Disney’s “Moon Girl” TV series.

“I’ve had the privilege of working with the ‘Moon Girl’ team for the last two years and they’ve been really open to exploring queer stories,” March said. “I put together like a tracker of our background characters to make sure that we have the full breadth of expression [with] all of our gender non-conforming characters.”

But having a quota was insufficient in pushing his agenda. “It’s not just a numbers game of how many LGBTQ+ characters you have,” he continued. “The more centered a story is on a character, the more nuanced you get to get into their story, and especially with like trans characters … kind of the only way to have like these canonical trans characters, canonical asexual characters, canonical bisexual characters, is to give them stories where they can like be their whole selves.”

Rufo ⚔️ (@realchrisrufo) March 29, 2022

President of Disney General Entertainment Karey Burke spoke just as openly about her plan to force her own sexual agenda on the eyes and ears of young children.

“We had an open forum last week at 20th [presumably Disney-owned 20th Century Studios], where again, the home of really incredible groundbreaking LGBTQIA stories over the years,” she said. “One of our execs stood up and said, ‘You know, we only have a handful of queer leads in our content.’ And I went, ‘What! That can’t be true,’ and I realized oh, it actually is true, we have many, many, many LGBTQIA characters in our stories, and yet we don’t have enough leads.”

In another apparent reference to Florida’s law protecting 5-year-olds from sexual grooming in schools, Burke added, “Perhaps had this moment not happened, I as a leader and we as my colleagues would not have focused on” inserting more LGBT characters into Disney stories.

“Going forward I certainly will be more so, I know that we will be,” she said, before pausing to fight back tears. She also reportedly signaled a goal that at least 50 percent of Disney characters will be LGBT or racial minorities by the year’s end.

In the same call, Burke proudly proclaimed herself the mother of “two queer children actually, one transgender child and one pansexual child.” The ages of her children, who she claims have chosen to be transgender and pansexual, are unclear.

Rufo ⚔️ (@realchrisrufo) March 29, 2022

In another leaked Disney call, “activism partner” Nadine Smith parrotted wild conspiracy theories about the Florida law. “We’re reacting from the reality that, when they can erase you, when they can criminalize your existence, when they can demonize who you are, the next step is to criminalize you and take your kids,” she said.

Rufo ⚔️ (@realchrisrufo) March 29, 2022

Never mind the fact that the bill dubbed “don’t say gay” by detractors doesn’t even include the word “gay,” much less criminalize its use or people who identify with it. Disney knows the bill merely protects very young children from being bombarded with adults’ sexual agendas, and that no one who isn’t seeking to groom children has a good reason to be afraid of the law. So Disney and its allies in government, corporations, and the propaganda press have resorted to straight-up lying about the bill’s purpose and flaunting bizarre theories like that Ron DeSantis wants to kidnap children.

Meanwhile, DeSantis slammed Disney’s weird obsession with teaching kids under 10 about sex and the company’s simultaneous double standard as applied to communist China, where effeminate men are banned from television.

“Why is the hill to die on to have transgenderism injected into kindergarten classrooms or woke gender ideology injected into second-grade classrooms?” the governor said on Tuesday. “Meanwhile, if we had done a bill that prohibited talking about the abuse of Uyghurs in China, Disney would have supported that legislation because they won’t say a word about that.”

"Disney’s Grooming Of Children Is Not New, But Their Openness About It Is","Following the passage of Florida’s Parental Rights in Education bill, outrage ironically came from a place that used to be known for its family-centric audience: Disney. The entertainment giant has been feeding social leftism into the minds of young audiences for a while, but now Disney has dropped all pretenses and is openly bragging about it.

In a video call leaked to investigative journalist Chris Rufo, Disney executive Latoya Raveneau was heard bragging about her “not-at-all-secret gay agenda” and said no one attempted to stop her or voice concerns when she went out of her way to place LGBT couples and innuendo in Disney’s animated movies.

President of Disney General Entertainment Karey Burke signaled in the same call that the company’s goal is to have at least 50 percent of new Disney characters be either LGBT or minorities by the end of 2022. There is no room left to wonder – they are indeed grooming our children.

Disney Wants to Shape Your Children’s Minds

Parents aren’t just enraged because there happens to be a same-sex couple in the background of a movie. It goes so much deeper than that.

The fact that adults working in children’s entertainment are intentionally forcing their sexual agendas on children should be infuriating and frightening to us all. They’re taking advantage of the innocence of children while they are most impressionable. Instead of letting kids be kids and using movies to let young imaginations run wild, Disney is actively trying to make them doubt fundamental truths.

Cancel culture has scared many parents from speaking out against these goals for fear of being seen as bigoted, but the time to cower to the mob isn’t now. A generation of minds is at stake.

Everyone has a worldview, and Disney is proving it will not shy away from an aggressive, all-out approach to molding and shaping children’s views of sexuality. Disney is bragging about coming for the hearts and minds of children, and every parent should be absolutely livid.

The madness doesn’t stop there. “Lightyear,” the newest Pixar movie set to hit the big screen on June 17, 2022, follows the real Buzz Lightyear’s space explorations before he becomes the beloved action figure in the classic Disney movie “Toy Story.” This children’s movie will now include a same-sex kiss that was added back into the movie in an apparent gloved mouse finger to the Parental Rights in Education bill. According to Pixar, the same-sex kiss occurs between Buzz’s fellow ranger and another woman.

We do not have a friend in Disney. While this is the first animated Disney/Pixar movie to feature a same-sex kiss, these movie moguls have been slowly working their way toward this moment for some time, and it started out so subtly you may not have noticed it.

A Gradual Subterfuge

In movies like “Finding Dory” (2016) and “Toy Story 4” (2019), same-sex couples can be seen in the background strolling down the street, sitting close to each other, and hugging a child. In the 2020 movie “Onward,” a female police officer mentions that she has a girlfriend, although the girlfriend isn’t shown on-screen.

Some even believed that the 2021 film “Luca” was a “coming out allegory.” Director Enrico Casarosa acknowledged this idea had been tossed around, but the filmmakers decided that Luca and Alberto’s relationship was purely friendship.

Perhaps the boldest of Disney’s LGBT agenda thus far was a 2020 short called “Out,” which told the story of a gay man coming out to his parents.

Jessica Darrow, the voice of Luisa in Disney’s recent hit “Encanto,” describes herself as queer. When asked about LGBT’s influence on Disney, she said, “We are the face of Disney at the end of the day.”

In adult Disney entertainment, the 2019 Star Wars film “Rise of Skywalker” and Marvel’s new film “Eternals” both featured a same-sex kiss and romance. Even the live-action “Beauty and the Beast” (2017) included a brief same-sex moment between two men dancing together in the final scene.

Caving to the mob and intensifying sexual content in family and children’s movies will do more harm than good to Disney’s brand, not to mention harming children everywhere. Parents — the people who spend money on Disney products — should all be repulsed by this kind of entertainment aimed at their families, and many are.

Disney’s Not Pretending Anymore

In its initial response to the Parental Rights in Education law, Disney continued its former status quo of being demure about its political agenda, publicly expressing a desire to avoid becoming a “political football.” But now Disney has decided to drop all pretenses.

A new statement from Disney railed that the law prohibiting classroom instruction on sexual ideology to kindergarten through third-grade students “should never have passed and should never have been signed into law. Our goal as a company is for this law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts.”

Additionally, Disney announced that employees would no longer be using the phrases “ladies and gentlemen” or “boys and girls” in announcements at the beginning of their beloved shows and firework displays. Just when you’ve thought you’ve seen everything (except an elephant fly).

Disney’s recent eagerness to make war on parents wasn’t part of Walt Disney’s vision for his life’s work. His dream was to bring fantasies of childhood to life through the magic of storytelling, not groom children for woke sexual agendas. For traditional families who want to hold onto innocent entertainment for their kids and keep them safe from sexual agendas, it seems like the only place to go is against the current and just around the river bend.

NYT Writer Admits Schools Are Grooming Children Into LGBT Identities,"Is Michelle Goldberg a conservative plant at The New York Times? Although she claims to be a liberal feminist, some of her recent columns are essentially admissions that social conservatives have been right all along. In another entry in this genre, she purports to critique the “freakout over sex and gender identity in schools” — only to tacitly admit that schools are indoctrinating children into LGBT ideology and grooming them into LGBT identities.

Goldberg accuses conservatives of stoking a “moral panic” akin to the “‘satanic panic’ of the 1980s, a frenzy of accusations of ritual child abuse that resulted in the conviction of dozens of innocent people.” Yet she then demonstrates the current fears are reality-based.

Her evidence that this is a panic consists of highlighting some unfounded rumors about educators indulging students with a furry fetish. She then admits that “there’s been a great evolution in how students think about gender and sexuality” with “an even bigger generational shift with trans issues. Many middle-aged liberal parents I know have different ideas about gender than their more radical adolescent kids, and I assume the gulf must be even larger in many conservative families.” In short, the sexual orientation and gender identity revolution is real, even if a few internet rumors about it are not.

Similarly, in response to the huge increase in LGBT identities among the young, Goldberg writes that “It’s obvious that more kids are going to come out in high schools where they’ll be accepted and celebrated than in those where they’ll be bullied and abused.”

True, and it is also obvious that this does not explain the mass conversions of adolescents, especially girls, to rainbow identities. Goldberg herself relays, without dispute, the example of a summer camp from which “a third of the girls came back saying that they were nonbinary or queer or gender nonconforming.”

This self-refutation continues to Goldberg’s conclusion. She does reiterate her ugly victim-blaming regarding the infamous Loudoun County rape case — why is a supposed feminist shaming a teenage girl for being raped in circumstances inconvenient to the agenda of men in dresses?

Yet she ends with a quote the victim’s mother had given to the Daily Wire, noting how her daughter was still drifting along with the gender revolution: “’Where does she get these ideas? From school, obviously,’ the mother said. ‘It’s not from our home.’”

The Left’s Contradictions

Once again, Goldberg has confirmed that social conservatives were right: educators really are leading students in a sexual and gender identity revolution, which is then furthered by social media and peer pressure. Nonetheless, Goldberg is probably not a closet conservative writing esoterically to get past her editors.

Rather, she seems to be ensnared by the contradictions of the left’s current orthodoxy on sex and gender. This sort of confusion, along with her apparently unwitting confirmations that conservatives were right, is inevitable because the LGBT movement’s justifying mantra of “born this way” is false, as demonstrated by what is happening in schools.

The born this way creed posits that sexual orientation and gender identity are innate and immutable, and that an authentic and flourishing life requires accepting these inborn identities. Thus, teaching young children about sexual orientation and gender identity is necessary to help them discover and live as their true selves, otherwise they will be repressed, miserable, and perhaps even suicidal. This is the logic behind the constant references to “LGBT youth” and “trans kids,” as well as President Joe Biden’s support for chemically and surgically transitioning children.

The True Source of Gender

But this view has been discredited. There is no gay gene. Nor is there an established biological basis for transgender identification. The case for transition rests on shoddy social science; some researchers even lie about their results. This is why transgender advocates rely on the abusive emotional blackmail of suicide threats.

The truth is that sexual inclinations and one’s sense of gender arise from a mix of biological, environmental, and cultural factors, of which genes are only a minor part. The interactions of these elements are complex and are not the same for everyone. We may have predispositions, but no one is predestined to identify as LGBT.

We can see this complexity and fluidity playing out in our culture, especially among the young. It is not just that youth are much more likely to identify as LGBT, but that they are deconstructing and recombining sexual and gender identities, often encouraged by their educators and under the influence of social media.

Educators Pushing LGBT Ideology

Nonetheless, the legacy of the (very politically successful) creed of “born this way” persists. It encourages teaching children about rainbow identities at young ages, justified by the presumption that some of them are already among the LGBT elect, even if they don’t know it yet. But rather than drawing out and nurturing intrinsic identities, instructing young children in LGBT ideology shapes their identities. Activist educators claim to protect trans children, but they are actually helping create trans children.

Horrifying examples are emerging of educators pushing young children into trans identities, even against the wishes of parents (some schools even hide these changes from parents). The Libs of TikTok Twitter account exposes a steady stream of such abuses — and these are just the activists dumb enough to boast online about what they are doing. In New Jersey, new state teaching standards have school districts distributing sample lesson plans instructing first and second graders in gender ideology and sexual orientation.

The LGBT educational agenda has more red flags than the Soviet army, from teachers talking to young children about sex to school counselors helping them to keep sexual and gender secrets from their parents. Groomer is as good a term as any for pedagogues who are eager to inform five-year-olds about sexual orientation, or who respond to the gender confusion of a troubled adolescent girl by encouraging her to inject testosterone, grow a beard, and have her breasts amputated.

The youth LGBT revolution is not a natural development among children expressing innate identities. Rather, it is an artificial social contagion encouraged by adult ideologues indoctrinating students — a six-year-old does not conclude on his own that a boy can have a vagina and a girl can have a penis. This is why parents are in revolt against the education establishment and why a liberal feminist writer can’t help admitting that the grooming is real.

Transgender Activists Use Unreliable Surveys To Emotionally Blackmail Us,"When discussing transgender issues, legislation, and other controversies, it is common to see the statistic that 40 percent of transgender people have considered or attempted suicide. Where does this number come from, and how reliable is it in determining the moral and ethical consequences of transgender-related policies?

While appearing on “The View,” Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg was asked by Ana Navarro if he agreed with Chasten Buttigieg that the passage of the artificially controversial Florida bill HB 1557, Parental Rights in Education, would “kill kids.” Without hesitation, he agreed with the assertion.

Chasten Buttigieg had absurdly slammed the corporate media-labeled “Don’t Say Gay” law on Twitter, stating, “This will kill kids, @RonDeSantisFL. You are purposefully making your state a harder place for LGBTQ kids to survive in. In a national survey (@TrevorProject), 42% of LGBTQ youth seriously considered attempting suicide last year. Now they can’t talk to their teachers?”

This argument has been echoed frequently in the discussion about the Florida law, which essentially addresses parental involvement in their children’s academic lives and prevents advanced education on sexuality and gender theory from being taught to children younger than age 10.

These Transgender Suicide Surveys Are Trash

However, of the two major studies on transgender suicide repeatedly cited in the media as settled fact, neither surveyed children of the age affected by the Florida bill, nor are they validated by other objective studies.

Chasten Buttigieg cited The Trevor Project, an LGBT group founded to address LGBT youth suicides. It released a 2021 survey targeting LGBT volunteers aged 13 to 24, with 35,000 respondents.

The primary takeaway from the survey states, “42% of LGBTQ youth seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year, including more than half of transgender and nonbinary youth.” The survey concluded that LGBT youth who received accommodation, recognition, or “safe spaces” that reflected their preferred identity were less likely to have attempted suicide, despite 72 percent expressing anxiety disorders and 62 percent having major depression disorder.

In a similar study, the 2011 U.S. Transgender Survey conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality, 40 percent of transgender respondents said they had attempted suicide. The survey was done through online and paper forms. It compiled the self-reporting of 6,450 transgender and gender non-conforming study participants older than 18.

The suicide attempt rate was recorded as 41 percent among all respondents, with variations depending on circumstances and questioning. “Those who expressed a transgender identity or gender non-conformity while in grades K-12 reported alarming rates of harassment (78%), physical assault (35%) and sexual violence (12%),” the survey found. Three-quarters (76%) of those who were assaulted by teachers or staff reported having attempted suicide.

These numbers have driven the LGBT left’s argument that “Anti-LGBT” legislation nationwide is harming LGBT youth. One important statistic from the Trevor Project survey shows us that 94 percent of LGBT youth reported politics significantly and negatively affects their mental health.

However, as with all self-reported data, consideration must be taken into account for bias and exaggeration. For example, the above survey also notes that “67% of Black LGBTQ youth and 60% of Asian/Pacific Islander LGBTQ youth” claim to have experienced discrimination based on their race in the past year.

No Evidence Limiting Sex Ed Increases Suicide

Understanding suicide attempts is complex. In the United States in 2017, according to the Agency for Healthcare and Quality, there were 1.5 million recorded Emergency Department visits due to suicidality or attempts. Of that number, 33 percent were people between the ages of 5 and 24. Of this, 10,880 children aged 5 to 9 were included. Children 10 to 14 made up 102,808 cases and children 15 to 19 were 207,915.

The Centers for Disease Control, utilizing death certificate analysis, indicates that nationwide, between 4,000 and 7,000 Americans aged 10 to 24 commit suicide annually, with the lowest number counted in 2000 and steadily rising up through 2018.

The truth is, we simply cannot say what does and does not “cause” suicide in youth and we can only speculate based on the self-reports of anonymous survey takers, assuming their reports are accurate. What we can determine, however, is that there is no objective evidence to suggest increasing parental involvement in schools and restricting advanced adult education on sexuality causes distress or suicidality, certainly not in children under the age of 10.

LGBT Activism Reduces Family Support

In fact, the self-reported data indicates that parents who are highly involved in their child’s personal and academic lives positively influence children’s anxiety and depression. While the Trevor Project focuses on affirmation of gender identity, pronouns, name changes, etc., what it is really measuring is the child’s feeling of being loved and accepted by his or her family. Ironically, it is likely LGBT activists’ typical actions, reporting, secretive and exclusive affirmation models, and suspicion of parents causes the most harm.

For example, the Trevor Project asks children as young as 13 if they have attempted suicide during various time periods, but does not contact authorities or obtain parental consent in any way. The child simply takes the survey online by himself.

Of the Florida law’s requirement that schools not hide a child’s gender confusion from their parents, Rep. Carlos G. Smith, the first Latino LGBT legislator in Florida, said of the Parental Rights bill, “An amendment was just filed by the sponsor of #DontSayGay to make it even more dangerous for vulnerable kids with a STATE-MANDATED outing of LGBTQ students to parents, specifically in cases of abuse, abandonment + neglect. This will have devastating consequences for our youth.” Chasten Buttigieg referred to this aspect of the law as “cruel.”

The current model of LGBT advocacy for minors is to ensure they are kept as far away from their families as possible, expressing their “true selves” in “safe spaces” at school and with adults other than their parents. The mere mentioning of requiring educators to inform parents of a child’s mental distress, changes in behavior, or other important factors is considered “dangerous.” Where the new law requires schools to keep open communication with parents about their children to catch concerns early on, the LGBT left wishes to keep parents in the dark as long as possible until the child is properly educated on his sexuality or gender identity.

The threat of suicide or self-harm should be removed from our political discussions entirely. It is inherently flawed, malicious, and self-serving.

Using children as a political weapon is far, far worse. The best situation for a child is to be cared for by his or her parents, who have an absolute right to know everything that goes on in their child’s life. Efforts to hide children from their parents under the guise of a greater goal is misguided and should be aggressively opposed. In these conversations, the tragedy of suicide should not be so simplified, politicized, and weaponized.

"Kids Struggling With Gender Identity Need Their Parents More, Not Less","Florida’s new law, the Parental Rights in Education act, prohibits sex education in the early grades and requires teachers to inform parents about students’ mental health. All the debate and fanfare over its passage still seems to end with both sides mostly talking past one another.

Opponents dubbed it the “Don’t Say Gay” law, arguing it prevents LGBT students and teachers from being their true selves and thereby harming them. As such, Disney, a host of celebrities, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and his partner Chasten have loudly denounced the bill.

Supporters dubbed it the “Anti-Grooming” bill, arguing that it prevents students from being sexualized, alienated from their families, and made vulnerable to sexual predators. It does so by empowering parents and giving them more influence over what their children learn in the classroom.

Although I fully support the bill (along with the majority of Americans), both sides’ framing tends to obscure the main question at hand: what is best for the students?

Even though it seems unfathomable that any individual or organization would oppose a bill that prevents grooming, many oppose this bill because they believe it hurts students. They believe it’s best for kids of all ages to feel completely comfortable and safe in expressing their gender and sexuality. This may mean keeping it a secret from the student’s parents, and cultivating an environment that actively affirms these identities.

I’ve seen this firsthand as a high school English teacher. On occasion, a student would come out as gay or transgender and request that counselors and teachers keep this a secret from his or her parents. At school, we’d then use these students’ preferred pronouns and requested names.

That doesn’t seem like a huge deal, perhaps, but that wasn’t all. These students frequently had other struggles, either emotional, academic, or interpersonal.

The majority of the time, these struggles were either the cause or effect of their newfound identities and lifestyles that everyone kept secret. Thus, a parent might have a daughter struggling with severe depression and sexual assault, and fighting with her friends, all of which happened around the time she identified as a boy, but the parent never heard anything about it.

The push for teaching sexual education and gender ideology as early as possible is part of this idea of “helping” LGBT students. I have heard other teachers and education gurus argue that if we don’t do this, we are unconsciously stigmatizing LGBT students. Tolerating students’ sexual identities and keeping their secrets simply isn’t enough; if must be celebrated and directly taught so these students can feel happy with themselves and their peers can better support them.

Even though I can respect the intentions, the logic of this argument always bothered me. I believe it fails in three critical ways.

First, it assumes parents can’t be trusted. In nearly all cases, the truth is completely the opposite. Parents love their children—after all, that’s why they have them, take care of them, and send them to school—and they are essential partners in their children’s education.

Teachers and counselors wouldn’t keep a child’s phone addiction or aggressive behavior a secret from parents. Similarly, they shouldn’t keep a child’s transgenderism a secret from her parents. Parents need to know so they can better understand and help their child, and their child can better feel loved and understood.

Second, it assumes that children of all ages, even those only a few years out of diapers and sippy cups, are mentally equipped to handle concepts like sex, sexual orientation, and gender fluidity. This is not the case at all.

Rather, kids exposed to these ideas suffer enormous confusion and encounter serious social difficulties. There’s a reason there’s a mental health crisis among today’s kids, and robbing them of their innocence by introducing adult concepts well before they’re adults is a big part of it.

Third, it is incredibly divisive and disruptive. By its very nature, a policy of affirmation and advocacy immediately casts those who dissent in any way as villainous bigots.

What existed before was a neutral policy that basically of avoiding these topics, sticking with academic content, and building up a common identity through school spirit and high standards. One could be Bible-thumping Christians or Marxist pansexuals, and still members of the same school community. Now, even family and friends are vilified if they express any doubts about certain labels and lifestyles.

People are right to be concerned about today’s students’ welfare, especially after what students were put through for the past two years. As teachers would attest, students desperately need community and guidance.

But this doesn’t happen through superficial inclusivity and taking a side in the new culture war. It happens when children are allowed to be children; when they can learn about themselves and others in a safe environment with an adult who wants to help them become better people.

Despite what critics say, Florida’s new law and others like it will help with this. In the end, it’s key to remember that the welfare of children is what everyone should prioritize and be able to agree upon.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/04/15/kids-struggling-with-gender-identity-need-their-parents-more-not-less/,2022-04-15
Large Library Association Picks 'Marxist Lesbian' As President,"A large organization that drives the training of U.S. librarians and their use of public funds has chosen a self-described “Marxist lesbian” as its next president amid growing concern about libraries actively connecting children to sexually explicit activities and materials.

Emily Drabinski was elected president of the American Library Association last week by the organization’s members. She will take office in July 2023.

ALA’s approximately 54,000 members include librarians, libraries, library graduate schools, members of library boards and associations, and library students. The vast majority of its membership fees, therefore, are provided by taxpayer funds.

Drabinski won with 5,410 votes from such an electorate, compared to her opponent’s 4,622 votes, according to an ALA press release. The election was conducted online.

The interim chief librarian of The Graduate Center at City University of New York (CUNY), where she was previously the “critical pedagogy librarian,” Drabinski posts openly on her Twitter feed in support of sexually exposing children, union-led political strife, socialist politicians, and libraries pushing explicit and far-left material on unwilling taxpayers.

On a personal web page, Drabinski touted multiple endorsements from labor and LGBT activists in her bid for the ALA presidency, including from Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers union.

“I so value Emily’s work in intentionally bringing a class, labor, and queer consciousness to her efforts as an anti-racist ally,” wrote fellow ALA member April M. Hathcock in a public endorsement of Drabinski.

For more than a century, labor unions have often functioned as a recruiting and muscle operation for the Communist Party and its fellow travelers and shell operations.

In a TV interview with a Boise station last week about her ALA election, Drabinski conveyed surprise at public concerns about libraries making pornographic materials available to children and buying them with taxpayer resources.

“It’s like concerted political efforts to sort of push this, sort of story about what libraries do which seems very, you know, it’s anathema to what libraries actually do, that we are, sort of pushing pornographic materials on our patrons and it’s really not what we do at all,” she claimed. “…There’s no big library agenda.”

Contrary to her claims in that interview, however, Drabinski’s other YouTube videos are replete with teaching other librarians how to “subvert” and inject hard-left politics and sexuality into their publicly funded work. For one example, consider one of many such lectures she gave to other librarians on July 6, 2021, titled “Teaching the Radical Catalog.”

In the lecture, Drabinski discussed her homosexual coming out experience and how saturating in a campus environment of proliferating sexual identities changed how she approaches being a librarian. At her first librarian job, “At Sarah Lawrence, absolutely everybody was queer. … There were so many ways to be gay. … And it was my job to teach those students how to find themselves in our library catalog,” she said. She described queering the library as “critical thinking” and “thinking critically about the catalog.”

Here’s a slide from that presentation showing the sexuality sections of the Library of Congress catalog. In it, you can see the Closed Captioning of what Drabinski is saying while showing the slide, which includes affirming the idea that “queerness includes the subversion of those kinds of normal family types.” She’s referring to the family types that naturally produce children — i.e. a married man and woman.

In the rest of the presentation, Drabinski went on to teach librarians how to change how visitors find books about sex, contradicting her claims to the Boise reporter that librarians don’t work to get sexual material into patrons’ hands. This very effort has been a part of Drabinski’s public professional work for decades, by her own public attestation.

“We can equip our students with the capacity to wring what they need out of library structures, and wringing what you need out of systems that exclude you is a necessary life skill for survival and revolution,” she concluded in her talk. “And we can also help build a way of shaping students as agents of change both inside the library and out.”

So while Drabinski tells the general public that librarians aren’t trying to help minors access pornography, by her own admission elsewhere that’s exactly what she has focused her professional career on doing, with taxpayer resources. In their endorsements, fellow ALA members and leaders said, as did “former ALA Council member” Jenna Freedman, that Drabinski’s professional “accomplishments” include “queering the landscape of library publishing and scholarship.”

This is supported by her Google Scholar page, which ranks Drabinski’s 2013 article “Queering the Catalog” as her top-cited work. In that article, she notes “the first program of ALA’s Task Force on Gay Liberation was called Sex and the Single Cataloger, a session about the trouble with headings for gay and lesbian materials.”

That ALA task force was founded in 1970, and was the first formally organized professional U.S. organization to push LGBT preferences. That task force now annually presents the Stonewall Awards for LGBT-themed books. Such recommendations are essentially “buy list” excuses for public libraries that ensure major taxpayer subsidies for often obscene, and what would otherwise be mostly obscure, books that few people ever saw or requested from libraries.

In the 2013 article, again flatly contradicting her representations to the Boise TV station, Drabinski developed a “strategy [that] suggests the possibility of a queer library politics.”

“Queer theory provides a useful theoretical frame for rethinking the stable, fixed categories and systems of naming that characterize library organization schemes and strategies for helping users navigate them,” Drabinski wrote. She essentially explained “queer theory” as the rejection of the existence of truth, either in language or in anything: “Viewing cataloging and classification from a queer perspective [is] — one that challenges the idea that classification and subject language can ever be corrected once and for all.” She argued that since gender identities are fluid, so must be library classification systems and stacks.

This is a rejection of Western thought and civilization, which is built on the search for truth. A search for truth presupposes that truth exists and can be at least partially known. This also implies the world has an intrinsic, natural order that can, and indeed must, be acknowledged (i.e., the natural law). So it’s no surprise that a woman who opposes truth, and instead deifies self-created and unnatural identities, calls herself a Marxist.

Whether in its predominantly economic or cultural forms (which, as they say, intersect), Marxists are committed to overthrowing the West, including all of its organizing ideas and accomplishments. In addition to lies and deception, Marxists use sexual chaos as a deliberate strategy of cultural destruction. The “queer theory” in which Drabinski specializes openly aims to destroy the West by destroying the natural family, natural sex, natural relationships between the sexes and the children those sexes produce only heterosexually, natural distinctions, natural hierarchies, and order itself.

The United States, especially in the Declaration of Independence and Constitution that gave this great nation its birth, is the chief modern example of Western achievement. Its achievements are precisely in recognizing and attempting to adhere to the natural order as closely as possible. And now those who hold the keys to its so-called institutions of learning use their positions and resources to erase truth and the natural law, which are the very foundation of Western society.

Like other Marxists, Drabinski also makes politically exclusionary statements that show she doesn’t approach non-leftists with good faith, instead desiring to wage political war against people who disagree with her with whatever resources she can muster.

For example, writing in the Los Angeles Review of Books in December 2019, Drabinski wrote, “The [political] right is interested in maintaining the status quo, preserving white supremacy and the continuing consolidation of wealth into their hands and no one else’s. … Like the United States itself, the right is enriched by capitalism, racism, and patriarchy.”

On that issue, at least, she was willing to tip her hand to the very accomodating Boise journalist: “I think we have legacies of racism to undo,” she commented while on another subject. To her, however, as to so many others now atop our commanding heights, dismantling “racism” means “dismantling America.” One pervy picture book and publicly funded twerk at a time.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/04/22/amid-public-concern-about-grooming-kids-american-library-association-picks-marxist-lesbian-as-president/,2022-04-22
Leftist Activists Hate LibsOfTikTok Because It Unmasks Them,"Image Credit MSNBC/Rumble/screenshot

The progressive left is very upset that people are able to see them clearly and aren’t afraid to criticize them any longer. This was made abundantly clear by the passionate support of Washington Post columnist Taylor Lorenz for her hit piece against the popular Twitter account Libs of TikTok. While the primary discussion has been the ethics of journalists’ selective targeting, harassment, and doxxing of private individuals, it was the underlying argument of justification that provides the most interest.

In one response, Lorenz argues, “Yes, an acct whose goal is driving LGBTQ ppl out of public life is bad. Gay/trans ppl targeted by the acct have had their lives destroyed, but the *point* of the story is actually a nuanced look at radicalization & how the right wing outrage cycle functions. That’s worth covering.”

In another, she self-righteously asserts, “Lots of convo about the ‘harm’ of covering a powerful online figure, but not much abt the harm done to the average LGBTQ+ ppl the acct seeks to drive out of schools and public life. I hope people read this whole story and understand this account’s impact.”

This theme became a primary foundation of support for Lorenz’s article. Huffington Post writer Christopher Mathias, covering “right-wing extremism and MAGA,” argued, “you don’t have a right to spread hate/fear/lies anonymously. there is a social cost to that.” Senior reporter for NBC News Ben Collins described the author of Libs of TikTok as “Fox News’ favorite aggregator of LGBTQ teachers they don’t like the look of.”

Popular Twitch creator Hasan Piker, with more than 1 million followers on Twitter, argued, “this woman is quite literally cutting propaganda for the republican party by blasting random queer teachers on the tl and trying to get them fired. unmasking her is journalism. making it seem like this is just some random twitter acc is odd.”

Critics Miss the Point

Yet among the many accusing Libs of TikTok of being “anti-LGBT,” none of them seem to recognize that the account quite literally reposts TikTok videos by LGBT activists themselves. The entire purpose of the Twitter account is to upload videos from TikTok — which each TikTok creator permits in their own settings and can alter per video — to demonstrate to its audience what LGBT activists are saying out loud.

Quite a remarkable number of self-identified teachers use their platform on TikTok to boast about their LGBT activism, often in direct defiance of school policy or the law. Somehow this has been twisted into an attack on LGBT people because many on the right, and a lot of average Americans, voiced outrage.

To argue that LGBT people are being silenced, harassed, and driven into hiding by presenting their own words is creatively absurd. Again, the account being accused of “spreading hate, fear and lies” did not manipulate these videos in any way. What the public witnessed was exactly what the LGBT activist in question chose to present to the world.

Parents Weren’t Supposed to See This

It is the bias of journalists and other media figures who agree with the LGBT activists on display here. They are offended that regular Americans would be critical of or even outraged by the transparent presentations of this activism — activism they hoped regular Americans, and in particular, parents, would never see.

TikTok is a medium largely targeted at pre-teens to young adults. LGBT activist teachers are not speaking to parents in their videos, they are addressing young audiences and virtue signaling to their like-minded peers. Responsible adults, parents, and community leaders were never supposed to find out about their indoctrination efforts and propaganda.

When Lorenz says, “[Libs of TikTok] is playing on fears and misunderstandings of who trans people are, while amping up extreme rhetoric and normalizing portraying queer people as inherently dangerous to children,” she is arguing that parents wouldn’t understand what they are seeing right before their eyes. How else would sharing the unedited self-expression of adult transgender activists with an intended minor audience be considered “playing” on anyone’s fears? It’s not the LGBT activists and their content, she insists, it’s the bigoted parents who just don’t understand.

This continued theme of left-wing adults advocating for parents to be less and less involved in their children’s lives, for their children’s own safety, is precisely why regular Americans and especially parents have reacted to these videos with such visceral outrage. We are seeing educators, often teaching children in pre-school age ranges, boldly boasting of introducing complex ideas like gender identity without parental knowledge or consent. Teachers performing drag shows during school hours wearing revealing clothing and middle school teachers saying, “If your parents don’t accept you for who you are, f-ck them. I’m your parents now.”

Parents Should Be Outraged

Of course rational people would find these things completely inappropriate and parents should be outraged that activists feel so emboldened to impose their own moral value systems onto their children, intentionally hiding it from the parents involved. LGBT activists are not being targeted for firing because they are LGBT. They are being held accountable for their inappropriate actions. Bringing all of this to light is not “attacking” anyone, it is simply showing the average American what LGBT activists only want kids to see.

The narrative that LGBT minors need exclusive and protected media, education, counseling, and adult affirmation from educators, while intentionally excluding parents, must be aggressively challenged. Parental rights must include full access to what their children are being taught and what public information educators put out.

Furthermore, the obscene argument that LGBT people are harmed when regular people react to their own advocacy must be mocked and dismissed. LGBT people are responsible for their own publicly shared words and they should not be protected from the consequences of those words by the like-minded media.

How Democrats' Culture War Is Destroying Their Ability To Govern,"New York Times columnist Charles Blow recently claimed to be “truly shocked” by a poll showing President Biden with a 33 percent approval rating. I was shocked, too — how could his approval rating be that high?

Blow, of course, is surprised at Biden’s unpopularity, and worried that the Democrats are stumbling into a bloodbath in the November midterms. Blow is paid to understand and explain politics and culture to his readers. That he is surprised reveals a lot about the bubble he is in. And his meandering analysis of Democrats’ problems illustrates how the ideology making Democrats unpopular is also preventing them from understanding why they are unpopular.

Blow initially blames Biden — for being too much of a “decent man … sober and straightforward” rather than a “showman.” This is a ludicrous assessment of a politician, who, until age caught up with his tongue, was one of D.C.’s preeminent bloviators. Nonetheless, Blow’s ordinary partisan delusion is less interesting than the ideological blind spots revealed when he turns to genuine sources of Biden’s unpopularity, such as “the fear of crime and the pinch of inflation” and that “Republicans are playing heavily into culture war issues.”

Class and Culture Wars Merge

Although Blow does not seem to realize it, these issues combine to reinforce voters’ disapproval of Biden. Democratic failures on bread and butter issues such as crime and inflation are related to the culture-war radicalism that has captured their party.

Twitter, not the blue-collar union hall, is now the heart of the Democratic Party, which is controlled by the educated, urban professional-managerial class, epitomized by woke, union-busting CEOs. This faction has merged the class and culture wars — championing cultural radicalism, entrenching its own economic interests, and neglecting the common good.

The Democrats are the party of wealthy diversity consultants lecturing hourly workers about white privilege and cis-heteropatriarchy while inflation eats away at wages and investment firms buy up homes in the hope of making America a nation of permanent renters. The governing priorities of those running the Democratic Party are sending government money to their clients (from teachers unions to Planned Parenthood) and waging culture war.

Dems Are Fanatical Culture Warriors

And they are fanatical culture warriors. Consider Blow’s complaint that the GOP is “challenging the teaching of Black history and the history of white supremacy in schools, as well as restricting discussions of L.G.B.T. issues and campaigning against trans women and girls competing in sports with other women and girls.” He adds that “Republicans are using white parental fear, particularly the fears of white moms.”

This litany of whines highlights the bubble Blow and his audience at The New York Times are in. Ordinary Americans know the difference between teaching history and teaching poisonous ideology derived from critical race theory. Americans understand that it is unjust for males to compete in women’s sports, and that it is perverse to teach young children about sex and gender ideology. They are angry when educators encourage children to transition, and outraged when they hide it from parents.

Voters have also noticed that the cultural left never stops where it says it will. We were assured that the LGBT movement was about tolerance for consenting adult relationships; now it is about transgender toddlers, child drag queens, and men in girls’ locker rooms. We are also now told that being anti-racist somehow means judging people based on the color of their skin. Blow and other bubbled liberals may be okay with mastectomies for confused teenage girls, but most Americans are not.

This cultural radicalism erodes Democrats’ ability to govern competently. Sometimes this is the result of neglecting the basic tasks of government in order to prioritize boutique cultural issues, other times it is a direct consequence of ideology, as exemplified in the crime wave resulting from woke prosecutors and defunding the police.

Cushioned from Consequences

In either case, wokeness is an ideology for those who are cushioned from its consequences. Indeed, wokeness is primarily a phenomenon of the college-educated, and especially the well-off; it is a niche, luxury political philosophy that thrives among the privileged and in the shelter of academia.

But though it is often a political liability, there are ways it serves the interests of its adherents. In particular, woke ideology legitimates the rule of the woke over the non-woke, and justifies economic exploitation and socio-political repression.

Wokeness claims to reveal the systems of unjust oppression that permeate society; it focuses on race, sex, and gender, and relegates economic class to a second-tier concern. This allows many of the privileged and powerful to claim to be righteous allies of the oppressed without having to sacrifice economic or social power or position. Indeed, many can claim to be oppressed themselves. This is why wokeness tends to focus on BIPoC and LGBT representation in boardrooms and Ivy League campuses, rather than helping the working class.

The Wicked Working Class

Thus, it is to be expected that woke discourse often suggests that the working class (especially working-class whites) have it coming for their sins of racism, sexism, transphobia, and so on — the wicked deserve punishment, not sympathy. This is why pundits such as Blow are so quick to accuse dissenters of racism and bigotry. And it is why the woke left supports oligarchic power in pursuit of its aims, and eagerly uses economic, technological, and cultural power to suppress dissent.

This is why professors are having to submit woke loyalty oaths in the form of diversity statements, and why mandatory diversity, equity, and inclusion training has become the norm in the corporate world. This is why the left is eager to use social media censorship to suppress “misinformation” — which in many cases is truth that is inconvenient to the regime (e.g., the Hunter Biden laptop story).

It is also why the left cannot understand its own failures. They have isolated themselves in a bubble that has drifted so far from reality and the concerns of normal voters that even electoral disaster may not bring them back to Earth. Cocooned in privilege and ideology, they think Biden is doing just fine. But most Americans have had enough of a government that is more committed to transitioning children than to controlling crime and inflation.

"To Prove You’re Inclusive, Download The Trans Sans Font Today","Much typography currently in use, like so many things in our world, was designed by white, sexist, misogynist, racist, European, toxic males. These male chauvinist pigs brutally pushed aside any female, LGBTQIA2++etc., BIPOC, or LatinX would-be font designers— and we know many marginalized persons were clamoring for typographic fame in the 16th century— to maintain the iron grip of white Europeans in the world of typography, to the detriment of everyone else. Which, of course, is how white male pigs operate.

As a result, every time a marginalized person reads anything, from a blog post to a highway sign to a recipe for bootleg Southern Comfort®, they are unconsciously stewing in white supremacy.

That is all about to change. According to a press release from InclusiFonts®, the world’s first woke type foundry, zir hand-selected team of marginalized victim designers will begin releasing bias-free typography, beginning with the sans-serif font Trans Sans™.

When employing the Trans Sans font, the work of the writing person can mean one thing today and its opposite tomorrow. Or possibly neither. In fact, every time someone reads it, it will convey something different depending on its literary “identity.”

Inspired by the work of Professor Lorna Roth, Ph.D., who showed that photographic film is racist, Inclusifonts foundrypersons made a careful and detailed study of typography’s dark and bloody history, discarded all contradictory information, then slathered what remained with leftist preconceptions and dogma to reach the foregone conclusion that typography was “problematic.”

All InclusiFonts will dispense with the usual font-weight designations, such as “thin” (fat-phobic!), “light” (as in SKIN?), “regular” (according to who?), “bold” (toxic Y-chromosome!!!), “heavy” (again with the fat-shaming), and— can I even say it?—“black” (!!!!!!). Additionally, all italic versions will be left-leaning.

InclusiFonts will feature unique keyboard shortcuts to make leftist screeding more efficient and enjoyable. For example, if a leftist screedwriter wishes to type the increasingly long-winded LGBTQIA2++etc., xi only needs to type Command-LG. Similarly, many common woke terms can be invoked by typing Command-T for Transphobe, -R for Racist, -S for Sexist, -H for Homophobe, -TR for TERF, -RE for REEEEEEEEEEE!!!, and so on.

When employing Nounjetives® such as GreedyCapitalist, AngryWhiteMale, and EuroPig in leftist writing, similar shortcuts using Command/Option (Mac) or Command/Alt (PC) are available in every typeface voluntary collective (formerly: “family”). If the writing person is particularly miffed, Trans Sans TERFed is the font to express rage most effectively.

As new victim groups are added to the LGBTQIA2+++etc acronym, InclusiFonts guarantees that their font library will include frequent free updates.

Fonts in the production pipeline include Phallic Inverted, Lefty Masked, Karen Ultra Meddling, Berries Twice Removed, SoyBoy Limp, Testis Tucked, Mammary Bound, Queer Irregular, 1A Censored (this font won’t work for conservatives), Puberty Blocked, and Mandate Extra Cruel.

These features and more can save millions of keystrokes over the angry, resentful lifetimes of engaged, enraged leftists.

Helping LGBT Activists Isolate Children From Parents Puts Kids In Danger,"In yet another public display against parental rights and keeping parents informed about what their children are learning in schools, LGBT activists are condemning the passage of a new Oklahoma bill they claim would “out” LGBT children. Activists have positioned the argument once again as LGBT children against their own parents. LGBTQ Nation’s headline states: “Oklahoma bill that could require school counselors to out students advances,”

The bill, SB615, has been hotly debated, with even Republican representatives suggesting its potential “harm.” Republican state Sen, Brenda Stanley argued, “My concern is that we do not break that confidentiality agreement that we have with children.”

Republican state Sen. Casey Murdock agreed, saying, “So, you do not see that it may stifle a 15- to 16-year-old that may have some questions and they may have some issues they want to talk to somebody about. Now they won’t because they don’t want their parents where they are at. Are you concerned about that?”

LGBT activists have gone farther, alleging the bill will endanger the lives of LGBT students if their parents are told of their sexual orientation or gender identity. However, supporters argue the bill aligns with state law and is designed to balance the needs of both students and parents.

Oklahoma state law requires teachers and administrators to disclose materials on sexual education to parents. Republican state Sen. David Bullard argues that some schools have gotten around this requirement by having school counselors provide the materials instead, as they are not required to inform parents.

Bullard has clarified that the bill does not break confidentiality between students and counselors: “If the student comes in, voluntarily talks to the counselor about whatever they are struggling with, then that is a discussion between the counselor and the student. It’s when they bring them in to elicit a response and they hand them a material of some kind, [that] they have to have it open for [parents].”

Essentially, the bill ensures that school counselors do not encourage discussion of sexual or gender identity or provide supportive materials without informing parents.

The argument that this may “out” LGBT students to their parents in the process and this outing is inherently harmful, however, is an assumption that must be challenged. In 1998, my school outed me to my parents. I was 16 and I was mortified by the experience.

My father was called into the school with school officials and counselors. The principal brought up the fact that several teachers had expressed concern about my recent behavior and mood and that other students had told them I was telling people I was gay.

Of course, there was more to the story than culturally insensitive educators overreacting to my revelation. I had been engaging in dangerous sexual experiences with adults, had recently begun exploring all aspects of gay culture and identity online and in books, and had fallen into an emotional mess of anxiety, depression, and acting out.

I gave my teachers good reason to be concerned. My grades had slipped dramatically, I was skipping school, and I was having emotional outbursts in class.

My father was confused, concerned, upset, and frightened by the revelation, although he later admitted he suspected it for quite some time. He began limiting my online activities and started to watch me more carefully, limiting my opportunities to sneak out late at night.

I certainly felt it was unfair and a hateful and intolerant reaction to being gay, but looking back now, it was absolutely the right thing for him to do. Keeping that secret nearly destroyed my academic career. I barely graduated high school.

My sexual interactions with adults put me in constant danger and devastated my sense of worth. Gay media did nothing but promise a brighter future once I escaped my parents who would never understand me. It was the perfect storm for tragedy.

LGBT Activists’ Wrong Approach

More than 20 years later, LGBT activists are still playing by the same rules, isolating teenagers, and now children, from their families and creating an environment of distrust and fear of their parents. Their message seems to be that LGBT minors can only trust adults who are not their parents to properly accept and educate them.

They argue that LGBT minors require special education, exclusive clubs, secretive identities, and to socialize with only other LGBT people. While all of this is promoted in the name of protecting LGBT minors from an alleged hateful and dangerous world of people who will never accept them, all it is doing is more and more harm.

There is simply no reason a school official should provide materials to a student without a parent’s knowledge. All scenarios in which a student may be in physical danger from his or her parents are already covered under the law, and school officials are required to inform authorities of concerns. While LGBT activists pretend that LGBT identity is a private experience for students to manage on their own, the facts tell us something very different.

LGBT Youth Are at Risk

The Centers for Disease Control has long recorded the fact that LGBT identity places a minor at significant risk for a multitude of dangers. More than 20 percent of LGBT minors report physical and sexual violence, including rape, from sexual partners.

LGBT youth are at a much higher risk for drug and alcohol abuse, HIV, and other sexually transmitted diseases. They are also at a much higher risk of severe mental illness. While this has been positioned as evidence of the effects of anti-LGBT attitudes and discrimination, the numbers remain steady despite dramatic improvements in LGBT acceptance and representation.

The reality is, LGBT adult lifestyles reflect these statistics, and have for decades. LGBT culture is progressive and designed to exemplify sexuality and diminish personal responsibility. When LGBT youth are guided to LGBT adults for affirmation rather than their parents, they find themselves introduced to a world of excess and adult activities they simply are not prepared for. The longer they hide this from their parents, the more likely they will experience negative consequences.

LGBT minors need their parents, and they need limitations, rules, and guidance; not unconditional acceptance and affirmation of their identities. Their parents need to know everything that is going on in their lives.

It is also simply not the business or responsibility of any outside person to dictate how parents manage and protect their own children. LGBT activists certainly think their preferred path is best, but they do not own LGBT youth and it is not their job to intervene.

Parents must have the legally recognized right to complete transparency in their children’s education and school experiences. Parents must be trusted to raise their own children, and their decisions must be respected. Our elected leaders must recognize this and our laws must fully support these rights. They are not optional.

Biden Just Had His ‘Deplorables’ Moment,"Six years after Hillary Clinton wrote off half the country as “deplorables” and derailed her own campaign, a desperate Joe Biden is following her failed playbook, only this time as president.

At the White House on Wednesday, Biden stoked hysteria over the potential overturning of Roe v. Wade after a majority draft opinion from February was leaked on Monday night. In doing so, Biden depicted half the country he represents in the Oval Office as zealous extremists who are hellbent on a new era of segregation.

“What happens if you have states change the law saying that children who are LGBTQ can’t be in classrooms with other children?” Biden said. “What are the next things that are going to be attacked? Because this MAGA crowd is really the most extreme political organization that’s existed in American history, in recent American history.”

BIDEN: ""This MAGA crowd is the most extreme political organization that's existed in American history—in recent American history."" pic.twitter.com/cYZVJOWsvH — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) May 4, 2022

Biden’s characterization of the more than 74 million Americans who voted for Trump as the “most extreme political organization” in U.S. history, even “recent” history, would usurp Antifa or the Ku Klux Klan, which is still active today.

Mr. Civility’s depiction of this imaginary GOP-led segregation targeting LGBT people in schools is as ridiculous as it sounds. No doubt in reference to recent legislation passed in Florida — dubiously branded by the left and its allies in the corporate press as the “Don’t Say Gay” law — Biden, determined to energize his own base ahead of a hostile midterm cycle, engaged in his own extremist fearmongering to warn that Republicans are in pursuit of something they are not.

In March, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation barring classroom instruction on “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” for kids in kindergarten through third grade. The bill merely prohibits grown-up teachers from seeking validation about their own identities, some of which are completely made up, from impressionable children who are too immature to comprehend inappropriate topics that have been complicated by today’s left-wing orthodoxy on sex and sexuality.

That’s a far cry from explicit LGBT segregation, especially when more than half the Republican Party today, 55 percent, now supports same-sex marriage, according to a Gallup poll published last summer. The survey found that 70 percent of all Americans support gay marriage.

Democrats, however, have continued to depict the impending end of Roe as the beginning of a nightmare where Republicans move on to criminalizing same-sex intimacy and even interracial marriage. Never mind that Clarence Thomas, a black justice who reportedly concurred in the February draft opinion that was leaked, is married to conservative activist Ginni Thomas, who is white.

Instead of tamping down on his own hysterical party breeding the divisiveness he campaigned against in 2020, the nation’s “unifier in chief” has chosen to amplify their dystopian prophecies that are really disinformation. This line of attack is in character for Biden, however. He launched his presidency with a cascade of divisive social policies while he defamed half the country as white supremacists in his inaugural address.

“To overcome these challenges, to restore the soul and secure the future of America requires so much more than words. It requires the most elusive of all things in democracy: unity, unity,” Biden declared the day he was sworn in, which his White House proclaimed to be “A National Day Of Unity.”

The words had immediately followed a call to end “political extremism”:

The cry for survival comes from planet itself, a cry that can’t be any more desperate or any more clear. And now a rise of political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat.

Within months, Biden dispatched the Department of Justice to investigate parents who attended school board meetings to express their concerns about explicit material presented to their children and endless COVID protocols.

In December, Biden ended the first year of his presidency the same way he began it: with a divisive message. In its closing Christmas message to Americans, the White House released a briefing with Covid response coordinator Jeff Zients thanking vaccinated Americans for having “done the right thing.”

“For the unvaccinated,” the White House said, “you’re looking at a winter of severe illness and death for yourselves, your families, and the hospitals you may soon overwhelm.”",https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/04/biden-just-had-his-deplorables-moment/,2022-05-04
Left-Wing Teachers Are Ditching Teaching For Sexual Indoctrination,"Examples of LGBT activist teachers seem to be pouring in weekly. One gaining attention comes from Cape Coral, Florida where, as LGBTQ Nation describes it, “Pansexual art teacher fired after allowing students to draw Pride flags.“

Casey Scott, a middle school art teacher, described the incident as simply a discussion that happened in class in which students volunteered details about their sexuality and gender identity. Initial reporting indicated she decided to take the opportunity to provide details about her own sexuality and then asked her students to draw pictures.

In another state, teachers in San Francisco held a Zoom meeting in which the question came up as to how to handle a parent who asks teachers to use her child’s given name and biologically correct pronouns. One teacher answered by conveying an experience in which a parent stated to them, “I know you were using a different name than my child’s given name at birth and the pronouns we gave them, and I’m respectfully asking that you use the name and the pronouns that we gave them.”

The teacher proudly described their defiance saying in return, “So, in my classroom, I will refer to your child by whatever name and pronouns that they’ve told me they feel most comfortable with.”

When I was outed in high school in 1998, I attempted to talk to a sympathetic teacher, who firmly explained this was simply not something she could discuss with me. I even decided to force the issue by bringing it up in class and she, again, firmly instructed me to stop, recognizing that the classroom was not an open forum for me to express my personal issues.

Yet another example, shared by Libs of Tiktok, displays a teacher excitedly announcing the teacher came out to peers, supervisors, and students, showing the teacher dressed up as a woman with a full beard.

Keeping Parents in the Dark

Many teachers now seem to feel an obligation and certainly a sense of entitlement to use their classroom as a group therapy session, viewing students as peers they can share secrets with. Unfortunately, this has grown into its own culture in which teachers position themselves as the sole source of safety for vulnerable students, who are assumed to have no one else to turn to. Many in this generation of teachers see themselves as an underground railroad of sorts to ensure students can freely express their “true selves” without the judgment or restrictions of their parents.

This has been demonstrated by the growing discovery of “Transition Closets,” where schools offer students the opportunity to change into opposite-sex clothing once out of the watchful eye of their parents. The entire system seems to be designed to hide children from their parents and teach them to rely on teachers or other administrators for protection and validation.

The motivation behind all of this can be seen in my own generation’s experience with coming out in the late ’90s and how we felt isolated, abandoned, and stigmatized, often by the adults who were supposed to be teaching us about life. We grew up to become teachers ourselves or professors educating a new generation of teachers, and we wanted to make sure students never experienced that again.

The problem that manifests is the teachers behave as activists rather than educators, seeing their defiance of school policy, parental requests, and even the law as a righteous battle for the greater good. Either arrogantly entitled or defiant, activist teachers seem to believe they have free reign in the classroom.

Casey Scott, for example, argued she was not made aware of any restrictions on topics of discussion with the students, saying, “Not once did anyone from my administration ever explain to me any topic that I was not to allow or discuss … as a first-year art teacher in a reinstated class with zero art teaching experience it is reasonable to expect … a mentor to help oversee and give me guidance but, none was offered?”

But why would she think it would possibly be appropriate to discuss complex ideas of sexuality and gender identity with students aged 13 and under? The pictures drawn by the students were of pride flags, which Scott took a picture of for the news. These photos show a lesbian pride flag, an asexual pride flag, a genderfluid flag, and a rainbow flag, among upwards of 10 crumpled pieces of paper. She herself boasted of going into details of what being pansexual meant for her as an educational exercise.

In the San Francisco school Zoom discussion, a teacher argued, “in my school district, LGBTQ+ students have a bill of rights — and the fourth one is that they have the right to be referred to by their gender pronouns and a name that fits their gender identity.” She went on to brag that when a parent complained about the policy, the school responded saying, “No, sorry. Like, our district-wide rule is that the student determines that, not you.”

When Activism Overruns Curriculum

Teachers and many school administrators have lost sight of their fundamental purpose and their obligation to parents. There was no reason for a teacher to explain that she is pansexual and what that means for her. There is no reason for a teacher to “come out” as though he is a teenager, in order to gain approval and validation from students.

Students are being taught to explicitly lie to their parents, with full school administrative support. Non-LGBT students also feel the impact of this, as they are made to feel excluded from these special activities.

Think for a moment of the situation in which the teacher allegedly encouraged her students to draw pride flags. There are hundreds of flag variations representing the full extent of gender and sexuality, except for 95 percent of the population who are heterosexual and accept their physical sex as fact. Imagine being a middle school student with a teacher who announces she is queer and begins encouraging queer classmates to draw pictures of how special and celebrated they are. Imagine the pressure they must feel to find something, anything, to fit in and be a part of the activity.

Sadly, LGBT organizations support the efforts of these teacher activists and the overwhelming message that all students should explore their potential sexuality and gender identity. GLAAD, for example, explicitly encourages teachers to change their language, ask their students for pronouns, provide LGBT resource materials and openly defend student identities.

The answer to all of this is more transparency for parents and for those parents to be active in their children’s schools. There is no justification for keeping school projects, discussions, or curricula from parents. Parental rights, especially in education, must continue to be a top priority for Republican leaders. The more examples like this that are discovered, the more active we all must become in ensuring children are learning appropriately in school rather than being indoctrinated by left-wing ideologies.

Texas Church Evicted After Pastor Criticized LGBTQ Mural In City Meeting,"Image Credit Ted Eytan/Flickr

A new mural in the city of Georgetown, Texas, is generating controversy for its support of LGBTQ ideology. Members of one church who spoke out against public subsidies for sexual politics at a city council meeting believe their subsequent eviction from the Georgetown Palace Theatre was retaliation for their speech.

The mural is part of a jointly sponsored initiative between the Georgetown Independent School District (GISD), Georgetown City Council, and the Georgetown Arts and Culture Board to display the work of one student artist a year. Under the agreement, GISD sponsors materials up to $500, and the city is responsible for hiring an artist costing up to $500, Georgetown Community Impact Newspaper reported in March.

Last year, the mural followed the theme “Everyone Deserves Kindness.” This year’s mural, designed by a student at Forbes Middle School, displays the phrase “be your own person” in rainbow text above an assortment of red poppies, with some flowers painted with the transgender, bisexual, non-binary, and other sexual pride flags.

Church Leaders Speak Up

Church on the Square Pastor Bradley J. Helgerson, along with two other church members, spoke out against the mural at an April 26 Georgetown City Council meeting. Calling the ideology expressed by the mural “an attempt to fundamentally reorder society,” Helgerson said his remarks were aimed to provide “theological context for the ideology lurking behind this artistic expression.”

“Many have been fooled into thinking that such a rebellion against reality is an act of liberation. That when we tear down every norm we will be left with a freer society, that true freedom comes when the shackles of the sacred are removed,” Helgerson said. “But the work of the LGBTQ movement is not the work of liberation, but of liberationists whose desire it is to destroy the societal order itself, precisely because of its demand for conformity.”

“In other words, it’s not a matter of open-mindedness, but of closed-heartedness to right judgment that is the problem,” the pastor said. “Therefore, their goal is to remove all judgment, all boundaries, as is testified to by the endless numbers of genders and sexual orientations they affirm.”

“I know this seems extreme in the context of one mural, but it’s not just a mural. It’s a piece of propaganda for an ideology that seeks to destroy Western civilization and to use our children as its foot soldiers,” he continued. “And so it’s not culture that we’re talking about, but it’s anti-culture. And to refuse to push back against it now will mean the substantial loss of real liberty for our children in the future.”

Two Church on the Square members followed Helgerson’s remarks with their own.

One member, Aliya Mathiesen, read Romans 1:18-32, and another, Kate Pamplin, expressed concern about the impact on her children and the well-being of children in public schools.

“It is a blatant lie that this mural is not an LGBT agenda push,” Pamplin said. “I don’t want my children desensitized to evil.”

At least one city council member also expressed concern that the mural was making a “political statement.”

‘It Was Retaliation’: Evicted without Explanation

On May 6, two days before its Mother’s Day service, Helgerson received an email from Palace Theatre Executive Artistic Director Ron Watson, stating the Church on the Square was evicted due to “resource management issues,” effective immediately. He did not elaborate further, even after multiple requests from Helgerson.

“I must say that I am perplexed,” Helgerson replied to Watson’s email. “Can you provide us more information as to what the issue is?… As a religious organization we are afforded certain protections by the federal government against discrimination and the immediacy and vagueness of your termination letter gives us reason for pause.”

Georgetown Palace Theatre is run by a non-profit separate from but with close ties to the Arts and Culture Board. Helgerson says the arts community in Georgetown is “very tight-knit.” One Palace Theatre board of directors member also holds a seat on the Arts and Culture Board.

A copy of the lease shows the church had a month-to-month agreement with the Palace Theatre, and Helgerson says they paid for May in full. The church has been renting the facility since September 20, 2020, according to the lease agreement.

Helgerson says Watson did reach out to the church member responsible for audiovisual work to coordinate a pickup time for equipment left in storage. When Helgerson and other members arrived at 4 p.m., Watson was not there, only the employee who let them into the building. A refund check for the remainder of May’s rent was left with the church’s belongings.

“It was highly suspicious,” Helgerson said. “The way that it was terminated just made no sense. It wasn’t like, ‘Hey, we changed our mind, we’ll give you until the end of the month’ or, ‘Here’s why…,’ or anything, it was just an immediate cutting off, giving us absolutely no chance of finding a place for our Mother’s Day service.”

The church has gathered the past two Sundays at the Historic Courthouse lawn. During their Mother’s Day service, two other churches joined in support.

“It ended up being amazing,” Helgerson said. “God took something that was done for evil and made it for good.”

Since the eviction, Helgerson still has not heard back from the Palace Theatre staff or Watson. Watson and Arts and Culture Board liaison Amanda Still did not respond to a request for comment and questions concerning the eviction.

Insane Left To Christian Kids: No Public Pools Or Summer Camps For You,"This spring I got an email from 4-H, a club I participated in as a child, effectively communicating that my Christian family need not apply to summer camps and other activities sponsored by the quasi-public organization. (County governments often sponsor 4-H activities.) This email was signed by a 4-H staffer who put pronouns in his signature and told me, “Youth are assigned cabins based on gender indicated on the 4-H camp application and registration,” suggesting children were roomed by gender identity rather than sex.

Naturally, I was concerned that my tween daughter and son might be roomed overnight with an emotionally disturbed camper or counselor if I enrolled them in this camp. Based on numerous reported stories, I know that if this did happen, the camp likely would not even tell me, so I’d only hear about it after the fact from my kids.

When I emailed again to confirm I was understanding this correctly, the staffer refused to answer definitively whether campers could be placed in private facilities such as bedrooms and bathrooms with transgender individuals. That’s an unacceptable risk to children’s well-being, as well as a lawsuit waiting to happen.

Given how socially contagious LGBT identification is, it’s not just about transgender issue but also exposing children to sexual information and pressures far earlier than they are ready. Hand in hand with grouping children by gender identity is forcing conversations about what that means, which pushes children earlier and earlier to declare and investigate sexual behaviors. This is destabilizing to their identity, not “affirming” it.

Given 4-H national’s commitment to the toxic “diversity, equity, inclusion” ideology, the fact that my Christian kids now cannot equally access lots of their programming due to 4-H’s choice to sexualize their activities was no surprise. But I still wanted to see in writing that my red county in my red state was indeed giving tax breaks and other government privileges to an organization that might room children overnight with troubled people of the opposite sex against their parents’ will. The answer is yes. (Thanks, Republicans!)

Everywhere We Go, Someone Wants to Talk Dirty to My Kids on the Public Dime

It’s not just places kids get naked. It’s everywhere. I cannot take my children to the public library anymore, either, because the shelves are so full of pornographic and hostile books that it’s not a safe place for them. There, too, self-righteous LGBT activism has resulted in effectively banning my children from yet another public place and weaponizing my own tax dollars against my children’s safety.

The shelves and displays in our library are full of books telling my children lies such as that “men can become women” and “some boys have girl brains” and “gender is a social construct.” I’m happy to have these conversations with my children when they are ready, but I know my six-year-old, and he is not ready.

My eight-year-old is not ready, and neither are my 10- and 11-year-old, frankly. It’s grotesque and evil to put books at their eye level that deliberately aim to confuse them about something so deep and important. To do this is to usurp not only my parental wisdom and authority over my own children but to usurp my children’s right to an innocent, emotionally secure childhood.

It Won’t Happen, And When It Does, You Bigots Will Deserve It

These all prove that rapidly rewriting American laws to ignore sexual differences has effectively banned Christian families from equal participation in public facilities and activities. It’s not just Christian families, it’s any family that thinks it imprudent to lodge their sometimes undressed daughters with an emotionally traumatized male at summer camp or to obtain swimming lessons at a public pool.

This all descends from the massive bait and switch inherent to the LGBT policy agenda. We were told it was only about extending government sanction to what consenting adults do behind closed doors. We were told it was about allowing people to visit loved ones in hospice and inherit without legal difficulties. It wasn’t going to affect our families, remember?

Anyone who raised concerns about how calling sexual activities that cannot create a family “marriage” would affect children, faith, and families was smeared as a know-nothing bigot. Anyone who wanted to logically think through how legally equating men to women in the social keystone of marriage would have a domino effect on many other laws and social arrangements was also smeared as a hateful bigot, all the way up to highly intelligent and reasoned Supreme Court dissents.

It’s the same toxic play we’ve seen work ever since: Anyone with a contrary opinion or even unanswered questions is not engaged, but simply smeared.

Men and Women Are Different, And That Matters

The fact is that equating homosexual relationships to marriage very often requires explaining adult sexual behaviors to tiny children. Erasing the differences between the sexes in marriage also leads irrevocably to erasing the differences between the sexes everywhere else, from bathrooms to pools to summer camps. Breaking down all sexual differences also results in discrimination against religious expressions that acknowledge men and women are different, and these differences are divinely ordered.

Thus upending the natural sexual order has resulted, not in the falsely promised “equality,” but in simply flipping which social system will rule. For what we were prevented from discussing or even seeing was the fact that these two regimes — treating the sexes as different and complementary versus seeing them as neutered and interchangeable — are mutually exclusive.

You cannot have both transgender swimmers and single-sex sports competition. You cannot have both the sexual profligacy pushed by the dominant LGBT activist class and protect children from sexualized childhoods and predatory social situations. You must have one or the other.

In the absence of clarity about this reality combined with effective use of power on reality’s behalf, abrasive, antisocial activists have fully taken over every public space. Any further sorties are merely tinkering around the edges of their all-encompassing kingdom.

Children Are No Longer a Protected Class, They’re Targets for Groomers

So instead of achieving equality, what we have really achieved is the subversion of children’s developmental needs to adult desires. Instead of equality, we have replaced legal preferences for the only sexual arrangement that produces the most stable future citizens — lifelong married biological parents — with legal preferences for sexual arrangements that harm children and send religious folk to the back of the public bus.

Therefore all who believe in protecting children from marinating in sexual imagery and ideas everywhere they go are the new underclass in our political regime, and in many cases no Republican officials will even recognize our legitimate concerns, let alone fight for our daughters. That’s certainly the case here in Indiana, where Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb won’t sign bare-minimum legislation protecting girls’ sports and nobody is even talking about making our libraries, camps, and pools safe for families (even though that’s one of the few value-added policies a state like Indiana can offer its citizens).

Many of our major public and private institutions are making the public square completely hostile to a happy childhood and faith. Their “solution” to alleged bigotry was institutionalizing actual bigotry. “Our kind” aren’t wanted in “their” territory, you see. Maybe we would be allowed to have separate pools and summer camps funded by our own money, as long as the ACLU doesn’t sue them out of existence like they do Christian hospitals and foster care agencies.

What we weren’t told was that letting homosexuals out of the closet would require stuffing all the children and Christians inside.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/23/the-left-has-effectively-banned-christian-kids-from-public-pools-libraries-and-summer-camps/,2022-05-23
San Francisco Pride Bans Police Uniforms But Naked Marching Is OK,"Police in San Francisco will no longer attend the city’s pride parade at the end of June after organizers barred officers from wearing their official uniforms through the streets they’ve sworn to protect.

“We want them to march in the parade,” said Suzanne Ford, executive director of San Francisco Pride, in an interview with a local ABC affiliate last week — so long as they obey a dress code. Meanwhile, plenty of attendees will maintain their tradition of marching naked. “They can march in marching t-shirts that say SF police, or SF County Sheriff’s Department, that’s fine, but no full uniform.”

The San Francisco Police Department responded by refusing to participate.

“Even though our members may not be marching in this year’s Pride Parade, the San Francisco Police Department will be on hand to ensure that everyone attending and participating in SF Pride Weekend activities enjoys a safe and celebratory Pride Weekend in San Francisco,” the department announced in a press release.

San Francisco Police Officers Pride Alliance condemned the organizers’ decision in stronger terms through a three-page press release.

“Let us be clear: this committee would not order the leather community to wear polyester at the parade. This committee would not order the drag community to wear flannel,” the officers’ pride coalition said. “But they have told us, peace officers, that if we wear our uniforms, we may not attend. For LGBTQ+ officers, this brings us back to a time when we had to hide at work

that we were LGBTQ+.”

The San Francisco Fire Department announced the city’s firefighters would join the police in solidarity.

“We need to allow the public to see that our uniformed law enforcement officers are good, they do reflect our community,” Fire Department spokesman Jonathan Baxter told ABC7.

Mayor London Breed said she will also sit out of the parade unless organizers offer to capitulate on servicemembers’ uniforms.

“I love the Pride Parade, and what it means for our LGBTQ community and for our city. It’s one of my favorite events of the year,” Breed told ABC7. “However, if the Pride Board does not reverse its decision, I will join our city public safety departments that are not participating in the Pride Parade.”

Organizers of Seattle pride events have similarly asked police not to attend the community festivities.

“Leaders of PrideFest have asked police to stay off of the festival grounds for this year’s June 26 event,” Axios reported last week of the festivities that take place at the end of the city’s grand parade. “PrideFest is making the same request for a smaller event it will host June 25 on Capitol Hill.”

PrideFest organizers also barred police from a rally held in its historically gay neighborhood, saying the animosity is warranted because of law enforcement’s use of force during the 2020 riots.

“We will continue to request police stay respectfully at the perimeters,” Seattle’s Capitol Hill group told Axios.

"If Amazon Isn't Woke Enough For LGBTQ Activists, No Company Can Be","On the first day of June, Amazon headquarters in Seattle hosted its annual LGBTQ Pride celebration, only to be interrupted by transgender employees protesting the company’s “transphobic” policies. If that takes a moment to process, you’re not alone.

Amazon was one of the first major companies to include transgender medical services in its health plan. Currently, the company covers full transition services and a wide range of elective and cosmetic surgery coverage for transgender employees, including rhinoplasty, liposuction, multiple facial reconstruction and adjustment procedures, and even a facelift.

The information site for Amazon Aetna coverage has a designated section for transgender benefits. Under the provider options, you can even specifically look for LGBT providers. Among other benefits, Amazon has an employee resource group called Glamazon, founded in 1999, specifically for LGBT employees. They have built a Transgender Toolkit designed for managers to help transgender employees go through transition and express themselves fully at work.

Amazon is arguably one of the most explicitly pro-LGBT organizations globally and has earned a perfect score from the Human Rights Campaign as one of the best places to work for LGBT people. Under Amazon’s LGBTQ+ books section, there are 60,000 results.

So, what could possibly be motivating protests by transgender activist employees? It comes down to two books, Abigail Shrier’s “Irreversible Damage” and Matt Walsh’s “Johnny the Walrus,” being sold on the platform. Amazon leaders have apparently refused to remove them from sale.

LGBT Objections to Books And Donations

Journalist Katherine Long documented these grievances in a Twitter thread, with accompanying articles detailing the complaints. Her first tweet reads, “I’m at Amazon’s Seattle headquarters, where about 30 Amazon employees are staging a die-in during Amazon’s Pride Flag raising ceremony in protest of the company’s continued sale of what they say are transphobic books.” In a video in the thread, showing security attempting to quell the protest, an activist is heard naming Shrier’s book, “Irreversible Damage,” demanding to know why senior leadership closed out a ticket to have it removed.

An activist organization within Amazon called “No Hate at Amazon” accused Amazon of “rainbow-washing” its reputation by continuing to allow the two books to be sold. It also opposes that the company’s Amazon Smile program, in which a customer can opt-in to have a portion of his purchases go to a non-profit organization, permits “anti-LGBT” charities to be chosen.

Seattle Pride, a non-profit organization, revoked Amazon’s sponsorship of LGBTQ celebration events in 2022. It stated, “Seattle Pride has decided to not partner with Amazon for the 2022 Seattle Pride Parade because of their financial donations to politicians who actively propose and support anti-LGBTQIA+ legislation, oppose pro-LGBTQIA+ and other human rights legislation, and for allowing anti-LGBTQIA+ organizations to raise funds from their AmazonSmile program.”

Amazon’s official positions include LGBTQ+ rights and say “The rights of LGBTQ+ people must be protected. We were early and strong supporters of marriage equality and will continue to advocate for protections and equal rights for transgender people.” Despite multiple public statements from Amazon on its strong support for LGBTQ employees and their favored policies, it simply wasn’t good enough for activists.

Back in 2021, several Amazon employees publicly resigned in protest of Amazon continuing to carry Shrier’s book. This after Amazon removed Ryan T. Anderson’s bestseller, “When Harry Became Sally,” claiming it violated a new policy that the company would not sell books positioning transgender identity as a mental illness. Anderson’s book, of course, made no such claims, but internal outrage pressured the company to act. Activists, however, were not satisfied that all titles they deemed to be unacceptable weren’t banned from sale.

LGBT Intolerance Will Harm Their Cause

The protests and demands continue. While it is uncertain why Amazon has seemingly quietly backed away from further action on other titles, it appears they have taken a more tolerant approach. Tolerance for differing points of view has become a risky business decision for companies that wish to participate in public support for LGBTQ. As LGBTQ activism becomes more intolerant of free speech and disagreement, the pressure on companies like Amazon continues to grow.

What leftist activists seem not to consider is that continued demands with heightened aggression and vocal intolerance for even the slightest deviation from their ideology will harm them in the long run. If Amazon, an objectively pro-LGBTQ organization, cannot meet the standards of acceptability from these activists, how can the vast majority of businesses hope to compete? The further activists push their most vocal supporters away for mild offenses, the less supportive rational people will become of the movement as a whole.

The good news seems to be that the influence of these irrational, entitled, narcissistic, and aggressively bigoted activists hold may be slipping away. Despite public shaming, shunning, and accusations of transphobia and hate, Amazon appears to be quietly ignoring the outrage and carrying on with business as usual.

As Bethany Mandel wisely suggested, “Time for companies to say ‘You’re welcome to find another employer’ and quit playing these games.” Perhaps Amazon is finally learning they can never do enough to appease the LGBTQ bullies and that it’s best for them, and their customer base, if they simply ignore the leftwing nonsense.

"Disney Doubles Down On LGBTQ Focus With ‘Lightyear,’ Others","Disney is going all-out in joining leftists’ June celebration of Pride Month, making same-sex themes central to a new “Toy Story” feature film spin-off and adding more than 100 hours of LGBTQ titles to family-targeted streamer Disney Plus.

After advance screenings, critics say animated space adventure “Lightyear” — opening in theaters on June 17 — “takes queer representation to infinity and beyond,” to quote USA Today, highlighting that a lesbian couple “at one point [greets] each other with a kiss on the lips.”

Following backlash over Disney creative executives discussing their ongoing efforts at “queering” children’s entertainment, it seems Disney has decided to dismiss the concerns of many conservative parents. That collective shrug in Hollywood could be missing the big picture. A Harris Poll released in late May ranking the nation’s Top 100 brands found that The Walt Disney Company dropped from 37th to 65th place in reputation just since last year.

“Disney’s about-face shows the reputational hit that comes when the public perceives you as being calculating rather than clear in what you believe in and stand for,” said Harris Poll CEO John Gerzema. Disney also recently reported less-than-stellar streaming subscription growth.

Entertainment critic for faith-based outlet Crosswalk Michael Foust says the clash of cultural mores between Hollywood and faith-driven families has been building for years. “Disney does not operate from a biblical worldview, so it is no surprise that it keeps offering content that frustrates many in the faith community,” he stated via email.

Melissa Jacobs and her husband, Jeremy, raising seven children in St. Louis, canceled Disney Plus this spring. While the family has enjoyed shows like “Bluey,” along with Star Wars and Marvel films, she stated that “the direction Disney was leaning” prompted their decision.

“Many of their programs no longer have a traditional family and instead highlight and celebrate queer, transgender, and homosexual characters,” she stated. “In many shows, kids are openly disrespectful to their parents. It’s all contrary to what we are trying to teach our children.”

Christians Object to Plot Twist in ‘Toy Story’ Franchise

The first Pixar production to hit theaters in more than two years, “Lightyear” is tied loosely to beloved “Toy Story” films. It’s billed as young Andy’s favorite movie, the one that compelled him to cast aside his cowboy Woody in the original 1995 film.

Reading between the lines of some critics’ effusive praise, families get the plot’s general drift. Sent on a peacekeeping mission, space ranger Buzz and his co-pilot Alisha face off against aliens on a strange planet. When subsequent damage to their ship maroons them for years, stranded Alisha meets a female romantic interest and the two “start a family together.”

For the Jacobs family, fans of past “Toy Story” films, “Lightyear” won’t be a summer outing to the multiplex. The mother of seven is author of “Livin’ the Dream,” which includes their story of adopting a daughter. She says the Bible guides their views on sex, marriage, and family.

“As a mom, I can see clearly that there are needs my children have that only I can fill,” stated Melissa. “Meanwhile, there are needs they have that only their dad can fill.” She added that single-parent friends of their family “seek out support” so their kids have “both a mother-type figure and father-type figure” involved in their lives.

Similarly, Foust, who is raising four kids with his wife in rural Illinois, observed cultural trends run counter to Chrisitan theology on marriage and sexuality. “Hollywood may consider us strange for even questioning the content of ‘Lightyear,’ but that shouldn’t surprise us,” said Foust. “After all, 2,000 years ago the Apostle Peter reminded us that we are ‘strangers’ and ‘temporary residents’ in this world.”

Two of the filmmakers behind “Lightyear” — director Angus MacLane and producer Galyn Susman — are “Toy Story” franchise veterans who say they’re eager to make something “exciting and awesome.” MacLane says they didn’t want the LGBTQ plotline to be “a superfluous thing” but an “accurate representation.”

If anyone is puzzled by this being the flick supposedly referenced in 1995’s “Toy Story,” while reflecting cultural mores far left of the mainstream in that era, producer Susman explained: “Though it’s the film Andy saw, we were still making it for today’s generation.”

Promoting Alternative Lifestyles to Children

Will many families forgo a much-hyped movie featuring favorite spaceman Buzz? For those who are Disney Plus subscribers, it’s merely the start of new additions to navigate during Pride Month.

In June, six seasons of “Glee,” three seasons of “Love, Victor,” and LGBTQ-themed “Trevor: The Musical” will be added to the streamer’s Pride Collection. (Last year, Pixar’s short “Out” with similar themes premiered.) Such a deluge of titles involving same-sex romance among minors could prompt some to readjust parental controls or bail on Disney Plus altogether.

Foust, an evangelical Christian, says believers uphold the dignity and worth of every person. It’s praising sin to children that is problematic. “We are to love our neighbors unconditionally — while not being conformed to this world by the entertainment we consume,” he stated.

No Christians Wanted

Disney’s leftist drift seems to be accelerating. As part of an initiative called Reimagine Tomorrow, Disney outlines its association with LGBTQ advocacy groups like GLAAD. Reporting on this initiative, the Los Angeles Times linked to a letter by current Disney employees who have chosen to remain anonymous.

“As much as diversity and inclusion are promoted, the tomorrow being reimagined doesn’t seem to have much room for religious or political conservatives within the company,” state these Disney cast members. “This politicization of our corporate culture is damaging morale and causing many of us to feel our days with [Disney] might be numbered.”

Several players in family entertainment, such as Angel Studios and GAC Family, are working to produce and distribute films and shows that appeal to families who object to Disney’s direction.

This all reflects how entertainment continues to splinter to reach varied audiences, said Foust. “More and more, it is obvious that if the faith community wants entertainment framed within a biblical worldview, the faith community alone must produce it.”

"Corporations See Dollar Signs, Not Rainbows, During Pride Month","Image Credit Hamann La/Pexels

Along with what feels like the entirety of the corporate world, the U.S. Marines recently tweeted a picture of a helmet with rainbow bullets to virtue-signal its support for pride month.

U.S. Marines/Twitter

Outside the military, other panderers are hoping to turn a sweet profit during the month of June. Insider Intelligence’s eMarketer reports that LGBT folks possess a disproportionate share of disposable income and “are more likely than members of other groups to seek out brands that represent and include them, to reward those that show sustained support of LGBTQ+ friendly media and causes, and to remain loyal to brands that are loyal to them.” According to a 2019 YouGov survey, “Nearly a quarter (24%) of Americans say they would be more likely to do business with companies that are known to be LGBTQ-friendly.” For that reason, this tactic of marketing toward LGBT-identifiers and allies can more accurately be described as “rainbow capitalism” than solidarity.

This is your yearly reminder corporate America (and corporations wherever else an LGBT lifestyle is celebrated rather than punishable by death) sees pride month as a moneymaker. The novelty of the rainbow flag in June translates to high profitability for companies and products that otherwise have no direct relation to the LGBT movement.

Here are some of the most ridiculous examples of corporations pandering with the rainbow for the green:

The Brooklyn Nets

In a recent tweet, the Brooklyn Nets wished LGBT folks a happy pride. In their efforts to be all-inclusive, the colorful mess of a graphic they posted appears to be ableist against people suffering from epilepsy.

Burger King

The fast-food chain, whose name reaffirms that there are only two sexes, debuted the “Pride Whopper” in Austria’s locations. What makes these inclusive, you ask? Double top or double bottom buns — which means only that the less fortunate will be stuck eating two bottom buns with their burger this month.

M&S

M&S is milking the BLT for all its worth, rearranging the letters and adding avocado to create an “LGBT” sandwich, which is cleverly composed of lettuce, guacamole, bacon, and tomato in that specific order. Your “pride and joy” is their profit.

IHOP

The pancake restaurant failed to shout out the ever-growing list of other leftist-fabricated sexualities and genders in a tweet tailored only to people identifying as pansexual — but whatever sells breakfast food.

Premier Inn

The hotel chain’s take on a pride month graphic capitalizes on the idea of “coming out,” with “Premier Inn” swapping its logo for “Premier Out” with a variation of the pride flag.

Target

Going beyond just changing its logo, Target released multiple new clothing lines featuring chest binders and packing underwear for women, matching pronoun T-shirt sets for families, so-called inclusive swimwear, and baby bibs that read “my first pride.”

In addition to the clothing lines, Target is also selling pride-themed pet toys, housewares, and children’s books. Some titles include “Bye Bye Binary,” and “The Pronoun Book.”

No Inclusion for the Middle East

Many corporations have opted to exclude the pride rainbow from branding for the Middle East, where homosexuality is a heinous crime. Here are just a few:

Seattle Catholics’ LGBT Event Reflects Rome’s Chaotic Messaging on Sex,"A prominent parish in the Archdiocese of Seattle is holding an interfaith Zoom event this weekend with the Santa Marta Center, an Anglican emergency shelter for LGBT youth and young adults in El Salvador. The shelter is funded by the United Nations and a New York-based LGBT nonprofit that gets most of its funding from New York state and the federal government.



The “cultural exchange,” hosted by St. Joseph Catholic Parish together with St. Patrick’s Catholic Church, will celebrate LGBT stories and discuss the work of the Anglican Diocese of El Salvador in advancing LGBT rights. The encounter welcomes all “bi, trans, straight, and cis” participants, and will feature a half-hour segment on “queer liturgy and commemorative activity.”



According to its website, the Santa Marta Center, founded by the Sexual Diversity Ministry of the Episcopal Church of El Salvador, provides support and shelter for vulnerable LGBT youth and young adults in a country that remains “very hostile to LGBTIQ+ people.” The center is named for Saint Martha, who in Luke’s gospel “provides hospitality to Jesus while her sister Mary challenges gender roles and … cis-heteronormativity.” The ministry team cites the story of Martha and Mary as an example of how “Jesus liberates us from society’s expectations of gender.”



St. Joseph’s, a parish run by Jesuit priests, is also throwing an “after Mass pride picnic” on the last weekend of June for all families, friends, LGBT folks, and allies.

Contrary to Scripture

The parish’s messaging defies Holy Scripture, the express teachings of Saints Peter and Paul, and 2000-plus years of Catholic Church doctrine. It violates the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which explains that the sixth commandment encompasses “the whole of human sexuality.” The catechism states that “everyone, man and woman, should acknowledge and accept his sexual identity,” explaining that “in creating men ‘male and female,’ God gives man and woman an equal personal dignity… though in a different way.”



The document clarifies that men and women with deep-seated homosexual tendencies should be “accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity.” It insists, however, on the church’s biblically founded teaching that homosexual acts themselves are acts of “grave depravity,” “intrinsically disordered,” “contrary to natural law,” and “under no circumstances can they be approved.” The catechetical tradition also recalls that “the sin of Sodom” is one of the four sins that, according to the Bible, cry out to heaven for vengeance.



The morally fluid Jesuits and their episcopalian companions don’t have to like the church’s teaching on human sexuality, but it’s catholic, biblical, immutable, and unequivocal.

Pope Francis’s History of Mixed Signals

Unfortunately, fellow Jesuit Pope Francis has had a strong hand in muddying what should be pristine waters. In 2021, the Vatican’s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a statement confirming that the “Church does not have, and cannot have, the power to bless” same-sex unions, as God “does not bless sin.” The Congregation’s response was consistent with the body’s 2003 conclusion against approval of or legal recognition of homosexual unions, in which it emphasized that “no ideology can erase from the human spirit the certainty that marriage exists solely between a man and a woman.”



Yet last year’s increasingly rare display of clarity and orthodoxy must be considered amid a decade of mixed signals and confusion on gay and transgender issues. This has allowed a noxious culture of freelance Catholicism on matters of morality to take root and overwhelm the Church hierarchy.



In a 2013 press conference, Francis infamously responded, “Who am I to judge?” when asked about Monsignor Battista Ricca, an Italian cleric and former Vatican diplomat appointed by Francis to a position of oversight at the Vatican Bank. While stationed in Uruguay between 1999 and 2004, Ricca was allegedly living with a man, a former Swiss Army captain, and reportedly got into a number of scrapes involving homosexual encounters.

In 2020, Francis made comments seemingly in support of civil unions for same-sex couples in an interview for “Francesco,” a documentary about his life. Last year he praised the work of pro-LGBT New Ways Ministry, an organization that promotes “an intersectional understanding of gender identity and sexuality.” He penned a personal letter to co-founder Sister Jeannine Gramick, who in 1999 was disciplined by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, then led by Cardinal Ratzinger, for “doctrinally unacceptable” positions on homosexuality, and the “promotion of errors and ambiguities inconsistent [sic] with a Christian attitude of true respect and compassion.”

Promoting LGBT Allies

Francis also has a conspicuous record of rewarding prominent pro-LGBT prelates with cushy gigs. In 2019 he promoted then-Archbishop of Atlanta Wilton D. Gregory to the Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., the old haunt of the disgraced serial predator, former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick. The year before, a group of concerned Catholics in the archdiocese of Atlanta had launched a petition demanding that Gregory disassociate the archdiocese and its institutions from organizations and events that openly endorse the LGBT behavior and politics, and reinforce and uphold church teaching on marriage, family, and human sexuality. Gregory was elevated to the college of cardinals in 2020.



LGBT sympathizer and Archbishop of Chicago Cardinal Blase J. Cupich was similarly just bestowed a membership position in the Vatican’s Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. Cupich had no problem with the city’s openly gay, non-Catholic mayor receiving the Holy Eucharist at a funeral service for a slain police officer.

Cardinal Kevin J. Farrell, McCarrick’s former roomy in Washington, D.C., who endorsed Jesuit Priest Father James Martin’s book on the church’s relationship with the LGBT community, was in 2016 made prefect of the newly established Dicastery for Laity, the Family and Life, subsequently made a cardinal, and this week appointed to chair a new committee overseeing Vatican investments.

Schism over Sexuality

Then there’s the Vatican’s failure to rebuke the German bishops, who are in open rebellion against the church over its teaching on sexuality. In February this year, Archbishop of Luxembourg Cardinal Jean-Claude Hollerich (another Jesuit) stated that “the sociological-scientific foundation of this teaching is no longer correct.”

In March, Archbishop of Munich and Freising Cardinal Reinhard Marx celebrated a Mass marking “20 years of queer worship and pastoral care.” Chairman of the German Catholic bishops’ conference Bishop Georg Bätzing of Limburg argued that sex outside marriage and same-sex relationships are permissible, the catechism should be updated to reflect this, and that in any case “how someone lives their personal intimacy is none of his [sic] business.”



Australian Cardinal George Pell called on Rome “to intervene and pronounce judgement on the wholesale and explicit rejection of the Church’s teaching on sexual ethics.” German Cardinal Gerhard Müller supported Pell’s demand that the Vatican take action, insisting that “heretical bishops must not be obeyed, and every Catholic is called upon to bear witness to the truth against them.”



In April, more than 70 bishops from around the world, 49 of them U.S. bishops, signed a letter warning of schism. They argued that the German so-called Synodal Path “displays more submission and obedience to the world and ideologies than to Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.”



Well may these well-intentioned bishops exhort, as Cardinal Pell put it, a rediscovery of the promises of Jesus, and an embrace of the “undiminished deposit of faith.” But as long as Pope Francis persists with his mischievous “God doesn’t disown anyone” guilt trips, instead of urging, in adherence to the Catechism, self-mastery, chastity, prayer, union to the Cross of Christ, and sacramental grace, the heresies will multiply, deceiving countless Catholics along the way.



To describe this as a top-down problem that requires a top-down solution doesn’t begin to convey the sort of invasive surgery required to remove this malignant growth. In the meantime, it’s no wonder that a notoriously woke Seattle parish is organizing — presumably while Seattle Archbishop Paul D. Etienne looks the other way — LGBT-affirming ecumenical encounters, pride picnics, and rainbow cookies for its deluded parishioners.

After all, when defiant U.S. bishops are promoted, and German prelates face no consequence for their full-fledged heresy, the pernicious “love wins” message is heard loud and clear by the clergy — faithful and apostates alike.

Parents Are Profiteering From Child Abuse And Corporate Media Is Helping,"The Whittington family was once again in the news last week — this time when Fox News lauded their mission to make their 14-year-old daughter think she’s a boy.

Viewers were left furious after the often-conservative-friendly network aired an eight-minute segment fawning over the Whittingtons, a California family that has been pushing their daughter Ryland to deny her sex since she was an infant. The full-block fluff prompted backlash from prominent conservative voices for celebrating sex experiments that lead to “sexual dysfunction, infertility, cardiac event[,] endometrial cancer,” and even transition regret.

Perhaps the most disturbing detail to surface, however, is that Jeff and Hillary Whittington started projecting radical transgender ideology on Ryland before she could even talk.

This kind of imposition by parents and “medical professionals” on children is currently under scrutiny from multiple Republican-led states, including Florida and Texas. That criticism, however, hasn’t stopped people like the Whittingtons from making money from their decision to permanently alter their child’s body and mind because a young Ryland, who received a deaf diagnosis as a baby, showed an “aversion to anything feminine” and would scream “‘I’m a boy!’”

It also hasn’t stopped corporate media outlets like Fox from profiting from elevating stories of children on the path to permanent, life-changing, and often detrimental alterations.

The Whittingtons first publicized their decision to raise female Ryland as a boy in a YouTube video in 2014. The video, featuring photos and home videos of Ryland as a little girl before her parents cut her hair and dressed her like a boy, quickly went viral.

Since its publication, the video has recorded more than 8 million views and served as the inspiration for several TV segments and articles by corporate media outlets such as ABC News, national and local CBS News, and stations local to Southern California where the family resides.

Because the Whittingtons were willing to sacrifice their child’s privacy for views on their website, television, and social media, they’ve been hailed by journos at CNN, Fox News, and other corporate media outlets as “incredibly brave” for showing “extraordinary courage … particularly at a time when transgender issues have been politicized.”

CNN, in particular, wrote several articles celebrating the family’s decision to pretend that Ryland, a minor, is a boy. In 2015, shortly before the Whittingtons began exploiting Ryland’s struggles in the form of a book called “Raising Ryland: Our Story of Parenting a Transgender Child With No Strings Attached,” CNN featured the family in a short film designed to encourage parents like the Whittingtons to lean into their child’s “I don’t like to wear dresses” phase, frightening parents scared of unreliable self-harm and suicide statistics into promoting transgenderism.

The film even has its own promotional Facebook page. Multiple publishing companies including Harpers Collins and William Morrow also ran advertisements promoting Hillary’s book featuring personal details about Ryland’s childhood.

The family was also boosted by LGBT activists and organizations including one set up in honor of a known pervert, Harvey Milk.

The Whittingtons are not isolated in their decision to turn their child’s confusion into a public relations campaign for LGBT activism. Take a look at Jazz Jennings, the male child who was pushed into dressing like a girl at a young age. When Jazz’s parents publicized his story, news outlets picked it up and TLC offered the Jennings family a show.

The “I Am Jazz” show documents the young adult’s confusion, mental, and physical health issues, many of which LGBT activists claim will be fixed by chemically castrating and mutilating children.

Ryland’s mom said she felt like “a child abuser” for trying to stuff her protesting daughter into frilly outfits. But when it came to publicly denying Ryland’s sex and agreeing to a future of irreversible castration and mutilation that comes with accepting the anti-biology movement, she was all for it.

Corporate media helped create the transgender craze, which is why outlets are so comfortable promoting families who cash in on their children’s problems. Instead of balking at the idea of manipulating children’s bodies based on whims expressed as toddlers, media outlets plaster transgender models on the covers of magazines, boost stories about parents deceiving their children into believing things antithetical to science, and throw massive tantrums when Republicans say Disney and schools shouldn’t be teaching five-year-olds about drag queens or any sexual content. Even the Associated Press has officially welcomed plural pronouns used for a singular person as fact.

It’s bad enough that Ryland and kids like her will never live normal lives because their parents sacrificed their privacy for profit and political points. But the corporate media’s hunger for exploiting stories like Ryland’s makes it thousands of times worse and only feeds a craze that’s hurting an increasingly large percentage of the youngest generation.

Colonial Williamsburg Is Betraying The Founders For LGBT Propaganda,"Colonial Williamsburg is the world’s largest living museum, and a place visited and loved by many conservatives, traditionalists, homeschoolers, and classical education devotees.

Williamsburg is beloved precisely because, for decades, it has faithfully depicted the founding culture of America in a meticulously recreated, and often re-enacted, Revolutionary-era capital. This depiction included America’s undeniably traditional, Western, largely Judeo-Christian roots.

But now Williamsburg has gone woke. In doing so, its leadership and staff are displaying conspicuous enmity toward the highly reasoned position held by America’s founders—a position at odds with today’s LGBT dogma.

‘May We Become Them’

It’s not merely during Pride month, which Williamsburg now celebrates. Colonial Williamsburg has established an ongoing Gender and Sexual Diversity Research Committee to uncover the contributions of “gender and sexual minorities.”

The committee’s web page contains four blog posts yielding the product of their “research” so far. It is both thin and adversarial. One article, “Pride and Prejudice: Honoring Historic LGBTQIA+ Voices,” is written as though only backward people think there are two sexes grounded in biology. It focuses mainly on one individual, Anne Lister, who did not live in Williamsburg or even during the colonial era.

Another article, “Standing on the Shoulders of Giants,” says the intention of the Williamsburg Gender and Sexual Diversity Research Committee is to undo “suppression” with an “act of rebellion” and “justice” to the end of “celebrating our progress” while “stand[ing] on the shoulders of [LGBT] giants.” It declares, “May we honor them, may we raise them, may we become them.”

The article backs up its claims with a smattering of images of 18th-century homoerotic literature and anecdotes of arguably LGBT figures in history.

A third article is about a play recently written for the Williamsburg stage, drawn from the experience of two Irish women who lived together as lovers in Wales in 1778. What it has to do with the American colonies is anyone’s guess. What it has to do with pushing a modern sexual revolutionary point of view is not a guess.



The content and tone carry the presumption of moral guilt against the traditional, reality-based view of sex. Woke Williamsburg dismisses those who take these views seriously. Rather than respected, believers in historically Western, classical, or Judeo-Christian views are framed as the bad guys—on the wrong side of American history. According to Colonial Williamsburg, this includes none other than America’s founders.

Sexual Revolution Overturns the American Revolution

The founders’ worldview was framed by the belief in a theistic God, buttressed with classical arguments for God’s existence and nature (arguments such as cosmological, moral, teleological, and design). This view was held by the majority of the formative thinkers who walked the intellectual journey that led to America.

Such a reasoned outlook was vital to the social and political thought of the colonists and Revolutionary founders. Our government of separated, decentralized powers came largely from this perspective of truth.

For example, the Declaration of Independence’s doctrine that humans are “endowed by their Creator with unalienable rights” echoed the Judeo-Christian and Western tenet of the sanctity of the individual made in God’s image. Yet the founders also were mindful of the truth of the fallen nature of humanity, and the need for a precise balance within government.

Federalist 51 warned, “But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.” Still, as John Adams wrote, “Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate for the government of any other.”

Theirs was a worldview that recognized the existence of two sexes anchored to biology — male and female — and the essentiality of the monogamous, heterosexual family to human social well-being. Hence, sexual revolutions that undermine this family structure are an attack on the founders’ worldview itself, and destructive of the pillars of free government.

That is why the culture of the late 1700s pushed back against breaches of this social safeguard. Woke Williamsburg now calls it “suppression” and “prejudice.” But those colonists, believing in the fallenness of humanity, recognized that not all sexual impulses are good. This included adultery, premarital sex, and homosexuality. Disapproval was a way one showed loving concern for fellow humans and provided stability needed for the common good.

Seven decades ago this would not have been controversial. But we are in the midst of a sexual revolution in which our elites accept as holy writ the contentions of the LGBT movement and demand subservience to it.

The Founders Were Right and Williamsburg Is Wrong

Many will defend Colonial Williamsburg’s attack on the founders’ views about family by bringing up the founders’ record on slavery. But there is no moral equivalence. Yes, America has a history that includes slavery and racism. But it also has a rich history of anti-slavery sentiment.

Many of the American founders are on record as anticipating, and hoping for, slavery’s demise. That hope was often generated from the very same religious and philosophical belief system that upheld the traditional nuclear family and vigorously opposed attacks against it.

So a large number of America’s forefathers would have foreseen the end of slavery and the movement toward racial equality in some form. But they would never have foreseen, nor approved of, the radicalism of the modern sexual revolution, including the LGBT movement.

What has this sexual revolution given us? Misery. Family breakdown. Social breakdown. Fatherless children. A porn epidemic. Depression. Teen pregnancy. Abortion. Domestic violence and self-harm going through the roof.

This damage can hardly be termed “compassion” or even “social justice.” America’s authors of political revolution would likely be shocked at the modern sexual revolution, but would not be surprised that it has yielded such sour fruit. Maybe those colonial founders were right, and today’s woke Williamsburg is wrong.

"At SCOTUS, Christian Defends All Americans From Compelled Speech","When the case of Lorie Smith, a Christian graphic design artist who declined to create websites for same-sex celebrations, goes before the Supreme Court, it won’t be just her rights at stake — and it won’t just be the rights of Christians.

Smith says her decision was based on the message, not the person requesting it. “I’ve had the opportunity to create custom designs for clients in all walks of life, including those who identify as LGBT,” Smith said. “For me, it’s never, never, never about the person who requests the design. It’s always about what message they want expressed.”

Smith said in a press conference last Thursday that she started her own design studio, 303 Creative, so she could promote causes she believed in, including “a heart for children with special needs, overseas missions, the beauty of marriage, animal shelters, and veterans.” When she wanted to expand her business to include weddings, the state of Colorado would not allow her to do so unless she created websites for same-sex weddings as well.

“The Colorado law restricts the fundamental First Amendment rights of Lorie and other business owners like her, and it doesn’t just target Christians only,” Sen.Ted Cruz said. “Consider it this way: Should a Muslim artist be compelled by the government to draw the image of Mohammed? Should Jewish artists be forced to create art that they consider to be antisemitic? Should a Democrat political firm be forced to take on Republican clients? Should left-wing newspaper columnists be forced to write conservative columns? No, no, no, and — as fun as it might be — no.”

Cruz and other members of Congress filed an amici curiae brief urging the Supreme Court to take Smith’s case, 303 Creative v. Elenis, which the court did in February. Kristen Waggoner, general counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, will argue the case before the Supreme Court.

Waggoner said a victory in this case deals with different arguments than Jack Phillips’ case, which Waggoner also argued before the Supreme Court. “Free speech and free exercise were in Masterpiece, but the court’s holding was based on free exercise — it didn’t touch the free speech arguments,” Waggoner said. “303 Creative deals with those free speech arguments.”

Waggoner said the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals rule 2-1 against Smith, in spite of facts that the court and both parties agreed on: “First, Lorie’s religious beliefs are sincere, and they guide every aspect of her life,” Waggoner said. “Second, Laurie works with all people, from all walks of life, including those who identify as LGBT. Third, the parties and the lower court agreed that Lorie bases her decisions on the content of the message, not the person requesting it. And lastly, the parties have agreed, and the court below agreed, that Lorie’s speech is protected by the First Amendment because she is communicating a message.”

Because the argument is about free speech, the ruling will set precedent for cases that don’t involve religion at all, including the cases of people who oppose Smith’s beliefs.

“A win for Lorie in this case is a win for everyone,” Sen. Marsha Blackburn said.

Childless Chris Evans Condemns Anti-LGBT Bigots: 'Those People Die Off Like Dinosaurs',"Without doubt, those who favor LGBT acceptance are morally superior to those who believe the various forms of homosexuality to be sinful. LGBTQ advocates are good and holy and virtuous. Their cause is so just that there is never a reason for them to question their moral assumptions. Don’t listen to those divisive spirits who tell you otherwise.

The bigots of this world imagine themselves to be quite clever. To rattle you, they will insist that you wouldn’t have to aggressively propagandize young children if it were abundantly clear that LGBTQI identities are equal to cisnormative ones. To make you doubt the justice of your cause, they will confuse you with statistics and appeal to outdated concepts like biology, claiming that straight religious couples with functioning, compatible genitalia and a high view of children tend to procreate at much higher rates than both gay couples and those whose ovaries and testicles are currently decomposing in medical waste landfills. Next, when you remind them that they’re on the wrong side of history, they’ll repeat the debunked claim that history is more likely to be written by those who exist than those who don’t.

What should you do, then, when their deceptive words are humming in your ears? Where can you turn when you’re haunted by the lie that the breeders and believers will inherit the earth and dash to pieces your child drag queen Shangri-La?

Thank science for Chris Evans.

Recently, Disney/Pixar released its newest animated feature, “Lightyear,” a film that bravely gave cinematic representation to the world’s most under-represented demographic–slightly gay secondary characters whose homosexuality is prominent enough to annoy cultural moderates but not enough to lose their money (oops!).

In response to the criticisms of the bigots who complain about the presence of a same-sex kiss in a film for children, Evans, the voice of this version of Buzz Lightyear, spoke bluntly in a recent interview with Reuters Television, insisting that those who oppose LGBTQIA characters in children’s films are not worthy of your concern. Their complaints will perish with them. Their bigotry will be swept into the dustbin of history. You simply need to wait for them to enter extinction.

To understand why his words are so comforting, it’s important to remember that Evans is an unmarried 41-year-old man with no children. Had his words been spoken by a man who sired offspring, they would be of no comfort to you. Had this malediction been declared by a man with a dedicated commitment to fathering children to whom he could pass on his beliefs, these words would have carried little weight. In fact, they would only have reinforced the false notions that demographics is ideological destiny and that children won’t prefer one mommy and one daddy to two daddies and three themparents unless they become victims of Baptist brainwashing.

Evans’s lack of children, therefore, gives much greater weight to his insistence that all LGBTQIA2 opponents will go the way of the dodo. How can you not be comforted by the glorious confidence of this man who has reached middle age and yet has zero children to enroll in Miss Naughty’s Preschool for Drag Princesses? If kidless Captain America is certain that transgender eight-year-olds will still be a thing when the children of anti-LGBTQIA2+ Christians, Mormons, and Muslims inherit the earth, why should we fear?

“The real truth is those people are idiots,” Evans said, speaking of the homophobic brigade objecting to his film.

Indeed they are! And you should be so confident of their idiocy that you do not fear forgoing procreation and leaving the children of your ideological enemies to continue your march towards queer justice. They’ll gladly oblige!

“Every time there’s been social advancement as we wake up, the American story, the human story is one of constant social awakening and growth and that’s what makes us good,” the film star added.

Absolutely! The human story is one long march towards libertine justice! Societies only grow stronger the more they encourage sterility and physically destructive sexual behaviors. That never brings about cultural collapse. So don’t feel an ounce of dread when you look at those Christian parents filling their 12-passenger van with their Christian children. Surely their great-grandchildren will curse their memory and praise yours.

“There’s always going to be people who are afraid and unaware and trying to hold on to what was before. But those people die off like dinosaurs,” declared the actor whose name would also die off like the dinosaurs if he were to perish tomorrow.

And may his example also inspire us to trust that our righteous names will live on forever in the songs of the children we never bore.

“I think the goal is to pay them no mind, march forward and embrace the growth that makes us human,” Evans concluded.

Amen, New Buzz Lightyear. If we simply embrace the growth that makes us human by rejecting the growth that makes humans, the kingdom ours will remaineth.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/06/22/childless-chris-evans-condemns-anti-lgbt-bigots-those-people-die-off-like-dinosaurs/,2022-06-22
Library Book Picks Push Gender-Bending On Kids This Summer,"The Association for Library Service to Children (ALSC) is pushing multiple LGBT recommendations in its 2022 Notable Children’s Books and Summer Reading Lists. Some of these books include a simple picture of a gay union, while other suggestions are fully centered around transgenderism, but in each case, these recommendations are meant to normalize and promote LGBT values and lifestyles to children.

By the ALSC adding these books to the reading list, it communicates that these works are of “especially commendable quality, books that exhibit venturesome creativity, and books of fiction, information, poetry, and pictures for all age levels (birth through age 14) that reflect and encourage children’s interests in exemplary ways.”

For example, children from birth to preschool are encouraged to read “The Pronoun Book” by Chris Ayala-Kronos to complete the summer reading list. As kids just begin to learn how to talk and read, they can also get a head start on trans pronoun propaganda.

In this book, young readers are taught that they can’t know what people want to be called. A boy may want to be called a “she” instead of he. A girl may desire to use plural pronouns such as they/them or a “neopronoun” such as co, ey, per, or xe.

“Milo Imagines the World” by Matt de la Peña is another “notable” children’s book on the library association’s list, and while the book is not LGBT-centered, it slips in a picture of a same-sex wedding.

The story follows a young boy named Milo and his sister riding the train to see their mom. While on the crowded train, Milo looks at the faces around him. Notebook and pen in hand, he imagines and draws the lives of the people he sees.

He imagines a whiskered man wearing a green hat living in a tall apartment building with his cats and parakeets. He imagines one man as a groom in a tuxedo and a fancy wedding ceremony for a woman who wears a wedding dress, but then Milo muses that there might be more than meets the eye and reimagines their lives.

This time around, the whiskered man sits at a table with his family instead of just pets. He now imagines that the woman in the wedding dress is marrying a red-headed woman in another wedding dress.

The recommended “Over the Shop” picture book by JonArno Lawson is a wordless book, but the symbols and pictures highlighting LGBT values are clear.

“A dedication to trans activists and some characters who are nonbinary in dress and clothing make a simple message of love and acceptance resonate subtly,” a school library journal commented. Along with this, rainbows appear in random places such as a belt, hat, or on the flag outside the shop.

For third through fifth graders, ALSC recommends “How to Become a Planet” by Nicole Melleby. The book was labeled one of The Nerd Daily’s “Anticipated Queer Book Releases You Can’t Miss in 2021” and made Lambda Literary’s list of “May’s Most Anticipated LGBTQ Literature.”

“As always, Melleby naturally integrates her queer protagonist’s discovery of her sexuality into a larger story,” The Horn Book Magazine commented on Amazon.

The story follows a girl named Pluto struggling with depression. Throughout the story, Pluto “learns” she has a crush on a fellow girl who “learns” she identifies as a boy.

“The definition changed, but Pluto was exactly the same as it was, and still is, as when I learned about it back in middle school. All of its properties are still exactly the same,” Nicole Melleby said in an interview with Eliot Schrefer on LGBTQ Reads. “Getting a depression diagnosis for Pluto-the-person is just like Pluto-the-planet getting a new definition. It doesn’t change who she is; if anything, it gives her a clearer understanding of who she is.”",https://thefederalist.com/2022/07/05/childrens-library-association-pushes-gender-confusion-on-kids-with-pro-lgbt-summer-reading-list/,2022-07-05
British Veteran Arrested For Reposting Meme That 'Caused Anxiety',"British veteran Darren Brady said Hampshire police were “impeding his right to free speech” by tracking him down for reposting a meme featuring the LGBT “pride” flag arranged in the shape of a swastika.

In viral footage of the arrest taken by political activist Laurence Fox who created the meme, officers tell the 51-year-old at his residence in Aldershot that “someone has been caused anxiety based on your social media post. That is why you have been arrested.”

https://twitter.com/thereclaimparty/status/1553383256439115776?s=20&t=52NbOB1HhUgDyRESuPn8ag

A spokeswoman for the Hampshire Constabulary told The Federalist that officers confronted Brady following a report “that an offensive image had been shared online.” It is unclear who filed the report but officers visited Brady’s home to “establish the exact circumstances around the social media post.”

Harry Miller, a former police officer and Bad Law Project CEO who was also arrested, said police first tried to “extort” Brady by demanding he “pay around £80 for educational course so he could downgrade from a crime to a non-crime, which would still show up in a basic Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check.”

That’s why when officers promised to return on July 28 to hear Brady’s final answer about “re-education,” both Fox and Miller were on the scene to document what Miller dubbed the “world’s worst shakedown.” When officers arrived at Brady’s house for a second time, the police spokeswoman said “they were prevented from entering the address to discuss a potential resolution to the matter.”

“As a result, officers felt it was necessary to arrest a man at the scene so they could interview him in relation to the alleged offence,” the spokeswoman continued. She also said a 57-year-old man, whom the Daily Mail identified as Miller, was “arrested on suspicion of obstructing/resisting a constable in execution of duty.”

“He was released under investigation, and our enquiries are ongoing. Due to this being a live investigation we cannot comment further,” the spokeswoman said.

Officers claimed to be “investigating an alleged offence under Section 127 of the Communications Act (2003),” a sweeping law that gives the United Kingdom government the authority to imprison someone if officials deem his online posts “grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character,” or if he knowingly makes a false post “for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety to another.”

The spokeswoman made it clear that “no further action is being taken” against Brady but maintains that officers “come to work every day to protect the public” and were “acting in good faith” when they singled out Brady.

“We are engaging further with our police and crime commissioner to make sure that we deploy our resource in a way that reflects need in our local communities,” she concluded.

Donna Jones, the Hampshire police and crime commissioner, issued a statement criticizing her own force and voicing concern “about both the proportionality and necessity of the police’s response to this incident.”

“When incidents on social media receive not one but two visits from police officers, but burglaries and non-domestic break-ins don’t always get a police response, something is wrong,” Jones said before promising to write the College of Policing asking for “greater clarification” on how police should respond “more appropriately in the future.”

That hasn’t stopped free speech critics such as Caroline Russell, a member of the Police and Crime Committee in the Greater London Authority, from demanding police “look into Laurence Fox using pride flags to create nazi imagery and posting the images on a public platform.”

“This is a hate crime,” Russell tweeted.

"If Parents Don't Get A Grip On Their Kids' Social Media, Trans Activists Will","An elementary school in Indiana must allow a 10-year-old boy who identifies as transgender to play on its all-girls softball team despite a new state law preventing males from competing on female sports teams, a judge ruled Tuesday. This is just the most recent example of how the trans movement is affecting our kids: an elementary school’s all-girls softball team. What is behind all these stories of young children gender bending? Social media could have something to do with it.

Social media and smartphones are harmful to kids. This is increasingly recognized and reported on by the media and has become a growing area of national, bipartisan concern in Congress. And parents already seem to realize that screens are addictive for kids, so they limit screen time and put boundaries in place around when and how often they can use devices. However, many parents aren’t aware of just how full of harmful content and dangerous voices many of today’s popular apps are. Time limits won’t cut it since even a small amount of time on the wrong apps can be extremely damaging.

The truth is that social media apps today are full of pornography, sexual images, and radical LGBT content directly opposed to conservative values and Christian beliefs. Kids are following and listening to complete strangers, many of them grown adults, whose voices bombard them on social media. And some of the loudest voices recently are those of transgender influencers.

LGBT activists have taken to the online world to recruit more followers, specifically seeking young people, to join their cause and become their allies. They prey on the vulnerability of children in order to convince them of the validity and normalcy of their radical, sexually perverted lifestyles. Influencers are actively working to undermine parents’ own authority over their children and to replace the loving influence of parents in children’s lives and hearts with their own “welcoming and accepting” rainbow community.

Social media companies allow influencers to peddle misinformation on the drugs and surgeries that are commonplace for transgender individuals. Influencers coach teens on how to lie to doctors and their parents in order to get these drugs or surgeries, which they promise will make them feel better. On TikTok YouTube, influencers talk about how great they feel now that they have “transitioned.”

The message they send to youth is, “if you feel uncomfortable in your body or feel like you don’t belong, just transition your gender and it will solve all your problems.” And what young teen in the throes of navigating puberty and body changes, as well as traversing difficult social dynamics, feels comfortable in their body and confident in who they are? Teens, especially girls, are ripe for recruiting to the trans cause.

One mom whose daughter began to transition was determined to get to the bottom of it and found out teens were making fake social media accounts that appear innocuous so as not to raise any alarms with their parents. These children’s — young girls — real accounts, on the other hand, were full of strangers sending self-made masturbation videos, kids sending each other erotica, people talking with each other about which drugs do what, talking about how they were assigned a different gender than the one they identified with, and discussing “top surgery” and “packers.”

Parents are the only ones who can protect kids from trans influencers and other harmful content online. You are the ones on the frontlines, and circumstances are increasingly demanding that you “go nuclear.”

Consider completely keeping your children off of all social media until they are in their late teens. Delay social media use as long as possible. There certainly may be practical challenges to not allowing your children to have such accounts, but they should be balanced by a recognition of the enormous dangers and social pressures that are introduced by having them. At best, it is far easier to delay their introduction than it is to cancel them once introduced. In particular, TikTok has been shown to be the worst app for serving up explicit content to children unbidden.

Don’t let your children have a smartphone. The near-constant access smartphones provide to the internet is a temptation too powerful for children to have in their pockets. The good news is that there are now plenty of smartphone alternatives that still allow parents to communicate with their kids but without the unbridled internet access and social media apps that prove to be damaging to the mental health and development of children. Swapping out smartphones for a safer, alternative phone for your child is one important and effective step you can take today.

Allow only public use of the internet. Parents should only allow their children to use the internet in a common, public space in the house. Don’t let children use any devices connected to the internet in bedrooms or other private places, especially not at night. Consider having just one family computer, or tablet device, kept in the living room where you can always monitor what your children are seeing and doing. And keep all devices password-protected so that parents have to unlock them for children to use. The organization Protect Young Eyes, warns parents to protect their kids from the “toxic trio” – bedrooms, boredom, and darkness – that increases the chances for digital temptations and harm.

Lastly, consider purchasing a filter or parental control software for all family internet devices. There are several good parental control and filter software options available today that block explicit videos and images, allow parents to block certain websites and apps, manage screen time, and monitor websites, texts, and more. Given how prevalent pornography and other illicit material is online, these tools can be effective in blocking sexual and violent content from children’s view. However, be aware that filters will not catch all inappropriate material, particularly, they won’t block out LGBT content unless it is sexual or pornographic in nature.

These are just a few examples of steps parents can take now to protect their children. For more ideas on what you can do as a parent and information on practical tools available, see the Ethics and Public Policy Center’s new Technology Guide for Parents.

Many of these measures will likely sound extreme to the people around us. Even friends who are parents may think you’re being a Luddite, but it is far better to ban or delay these technologies in your home and face the challenges of battling your kids or the social snubbing of others than to embrace them and surrender your child’s soul to the voices of strangers online who do not have your child’s best interests at heart.

You are your child’s parent. Don’t abdicate your most fundamental role in their lives by being too passive and permissive about their use of social media and the internet.

"The Left Says Yes To Covid Lockdown, No To Stopping Gay Orgies","Like many people, far too many, I lost a loved one to Covid-19. My grandmother came to visit her family a few weeks before she became ill, she was there to show off her new husband, her fifth, having outlived her others. She was perky, sassy, and the happiest I had seen her. She greeted my husband and me with a wide smile and an enthusiastic hug. In her 80s, she had never let anything stop her, but she never anticipated the power of the government.

When she and her husband both tested positive, they were separated. She spent the next week alone, isolated from her family. Covid regulations kept her locked in a room, afraid and crying to see her family one last time. She passed before she was allowed to have the chance. Further Covid regulations prevented us from holding a funeral for her. I had begun making her a quilt, but I wasn’t able to finish in time. All I could think about was all those photos of elderly couples separated by walls of plastic, only wanting to embrace each other.

Yet, for two years, we were all told that these cultural and familial traditions were selfish and dangerous. As Paul Krugman smugly lectured in the New York Times in 2020, “What they call ‘freedom’ is actually absence of responsibility. Rational policy in a pandemic, however, is all about taking responsibility. The main reason you shouldn’t go to a bar and should wear a mask isn’t self-protection, although that’s part of it; the point is that congregating in noisy, crowded spaces or exhaling droplets into shared air puts others at risk. And that’s the kind of thing America’s right just hates, hates to hear.”

Joel Mathis of The Week, citing an anonymous woman replying to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s, D-N.Y., demanding that people stay home, “‘I’ll do what I want’ — that could end up killing people.” He continued, “her conception that ‘America’ means doing whatever you want, even if it risks harming your neighbors. She’s far from alone in believing the animating idea of this country is a sort of freedom from any responsibility to our fellow citizens.”

After so much emphasis on the importance of personal sacrifice for the greater good, you would think that a new, highly contagious disease would be treated with more seriousness by the left. Instead, when monkeypox crossed over onto America’s shores, the left decided the rules no longer applied to them. Similar to how 1,000 health professionals demanded Black Lives Matter protests were worth the risk during the height of Covid, LGBT folks decided anonymous sex and fetish parades were more important than public safety.

California state Sen. Scott Wiener, best known for lowering the criminal penalty for knowingly exposing others to HIV and advocating to keep adults as old as 24 from being placed on the sex offender list if they sexually exploit a minor as young as 14, declared, “Lots of sex shaming of gay men around monkeypox. The same shaming we saw in the 1980s re HIV. Lecturing people not to have sex isn’t a public health strategy. It didn’t stop HIV — it made it worse — & it won’t stop monkeypox. What will work is vaccination, testing & education.”

Encouraging his fellow citizens in San Francisco to ignore the consequences of public sexual exploits, he happily proclaimed, “Awesome @SFAIDSFound guidance on monkeypox & fun. We can continue to have fun while reducing risk. Closing bathhouses in 1980s didn’t reduce HIV. It was an epic blunder & pushed people into the shadows. Let’s not make that same knee-jerk mistake with MPX.”

Jack Turban, assistant professor of child psychiatry at UC San Francisco, insisted, “Monkeypox has serious physical symptoms, but we also need to focus on the mental health impact for the #queer community. Being gay is a healthy & normal aspect of human diversity. Sex is a healthy normal part of life. Have pride in your community while we combat the virus.” Unfortunately, far too many gay men seem intent on keeping their self-esteem intact through prioritizing “fun.”

As the Daily Caller reported, a popular OnlyFans user, with 98,000 followers on his adult Twitter, put into perspective how far this all can go. In the middle of a growing monkeypox outbreak in the gay male community, he decided to attend two orgies in one weekend — sexually engaging with at least 20 and upwards of 40 men — hook up with three additional strangers later that evening, and enjoy a four-way the following day before discovering he had been infected with the disease. If that sounds like an extreme example, keep in mind that the festival promoted by the San Francisco AIDS Foundation was described as “Up Your Alley (aka Dore Alley), where you’ll get your fill of hot hairy daddies, hungry pigs, BDSM babes and kinks of all kinds. Douchie’s got some hot tips for a fun and filthy weekend — free of anxiety.”

Without a hint of self-awareness, Sen. Wiener gasped on Aug. 1, “The monkeypox outbreak is an emergency & we need to use every tool we have to control it. I’m deeply grateful to @GavinNewsom for recognizing the peril we face & thus declaring a state of emergency. This will help expand vaccination, testing & other critical health strategies.” The New England Journal of Medicine determined that 98 percent of cases were gay and bisexual men. The World Health Organization urged gay and bisexual men to limit sexual partners to address the rapid spread.

Despite the above reports indicating that 95 percent of cases have been caused by sexual activity, LGBT people have moved from demanding the disease is not a “gay disease” and complaining of stigma and homophobia to indignantly complaining the government has failed to specifically protect gay people due to bigotry. CNN quoted Samuel Garrett-Pate of Equality California, demanding, “We faced outbreaks that have turned into crises that have turned into epidemics and pandemics that disproportionately impact our community in the past, and unfortunately, in the past, public health entities starting with the CDC and FDA have not moved quickly enough or afforded these outbreaks and public health crises the urgency that they demand.”

During the Covid pandemic, everyone was expected to shut down their lives, at great sacrifice to their families and careers, lock down, stay indoors, and wear masks. The police raided Orthodox Jewish homes to stop services and arrested pastors for holding church services, funerals weren’t allowed, and the media, especially LGBT media, mocked people for dying from Covid. People were accused of being murderers and dangers to society, and Wiener himself berated members of Congress for failing to wear masks.

Yet the most basic expectations of self-control and personal responsibility have been deemed outrageous homophobic bigotry. Unfortunately, this two-tiered system could have serious consequences far beyond the spread among gay male populations. As the CDC points out, monkeypox spreads through close skin-to-skin contact and exchange of body fluids, but also through dirty clothing and fluids from open sores left on surfaces. As gay men spread the virus within their population at startling rates, the chances of it escaping into the mundane world through close contact in stores, crowded streets, or buses increases.

We shut down the world for a virus that had no traceable transmission, it was entirely random. It really isn’t too much to ask for gay men to stop engaging in orgies and public sex events for their “mental health,” their “self-esteem,” and to continue “having fun.” This time around, truly selfish behavior is endangering the rest of us, and we shouldn’t be shamed for speaking out against it.

LGBT Activism In Sports Is Forcing More Christians Off The Field,"As professional sports continue to endorse the LGBT movement’s coerced celebration of selected sexual behaviors, Christian athletes increasingly face the possibility of choosing between their livelihoods and their faith.

In late July, as her team was about to play against the Washington Spirit, defender Jaelene Daniels from the North Carolina Courage refused to wear a gay pride jersey. The jerseys and game marked an end to the club’s “Pride Festival.”

In response to Daniels’ refusal, Sean Nahas, her team’s coach, chose not to place her on the roster of eligible players for the game. Nahas admitted he made the decision to appease his LGBTQ players.

This isn’t the first time Daniels encountered trouble for adhering to her beliefs. In May 2017, she left the national team’s training camp two weeks after the United States Soccer Federation announced plans to have the women’s team wear rainbow jersey numerals in overseas exhibitions during LBGT Pride Month. Since making this decision, Daniels hasn’t represented the United States in international competition despite having frequently done so in the past.

Daniels’ choice to reject forced LGBTQ activism reflects her faith. When the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in 2015, she tweeted, “This world is falling farther and farther away from God … All that can be done by believers is to continue to pray.”

The defender elaborated on Instagram: “I believe with every fiber in my body that what was written 2,000 years ago in the Bible is undoubtedly true. It’s not a fictional book. It’s not a pick and choose what you want to believe … My heart is that as Christians we don’t begin to throw a tantrum over what has been brought into law today, but we become that much more loving. That through our love, the lost, rejected, and abandoned find Christ.”

Daniels does not stand alone. On June 4, as the Tampa Bay Rays prepared for their own “Pride Night” against the Chicago White Sox, five pitchers chose not to wear adhesive patches depicting the Rays’ sunburst emblem in a rainbow motif or caps featuring the “TB” logo in a similar fashion. Manager Kevin Cash kept none of them from playing. Two even pitched in relief.

Reliever Jason Adam, who led Rays’ pitchers in appearances as of Aug. 1, was among those who chose not to wear the themed accessories. He explained why afterward.

“A lot of it comes down to faith,” Adam said. “So it’s a hard decision. Ultimately, we all said we want them to know that all are welcome and loved here.”

Nevertheless, some LGBT individuals and their supporters were enraged by the athletes declining to celebrate them.

“FACT CHECK: Jesus never said a word about homosexuality, but he did tell Tampa Rays pitcher Jason Adams (sic) not to be a judgmental, holier-than-thou -sshole,” tweeted Devin Green, an Internet comedian who mocks Christianity as the satirical character “Betty Bowers.”

With woke ideology more swiftly politicizing women’s sports, Daniels confronts more sustained criticism. When the Courage re-signed her in December, some alleged fans became so outraged that the club apologized in a statement defending the move.

“We are very sorry to all those we have hurt, especially those within the LGBTQIA+ community,” the statement read. “We’ve spent the past few days reading your messages and reflecting on our actions.

“The decision to re-sign Jaelene was not made lightly and included significant conversations between organization leadership and Jaelene. The priority expressed in those conversations is the safety of our players and maintaining an inclusive, respectful space for the entire team.”

The statement included several initiatives to support the LGBT movement and “remedy the harm” Daniels’ signing represented. One would be the commitment to rainbow-themed jerseys. Daniels responded with a statement on Instagram that praised the club and her teammates but also included an affirmation of her beliefs.

She said, “I remain committed to my faith and my desire for people to know that my love for them isn’t based on their belief system or sexuality.”

Pro-LGBT's Sex Ed Push For 'Health' And 'Safety' Was A Lie,"Sexualizing childhood in the name of harm reduction is the latest roll in our rolling sexual revolution. We are told that childhood sexual education is necessary to prevent suicide and interpersonal violence, prevent AIDS, avoid pregnancy, and build a safe environment in schools. According to what is known as “minority stress” theory, people with non-heterosexual orientations experience an endless series of microaggressions, overt rejections, invidious discrimination, or stigmatization that undermines their psychiatric and physical health.

And indeed, the social environment has become much less stressful for sexual minorities than it was 50 years ago. The average age for coming out of the closet among Americans has decreased from 26 years old for those roughly born in the 1970s to 16.9 years old for those born in this century. The average age for same-sex sexual activity is decreased from 19.2 years old for those born in the 1970s to 16.3 for the younger cohort, driven by “marked improvements in the social and legal environments for sexual minorities,” according to UCLA epidemiologist Ilan Meyer.

But less stress has not brought with it the better health that the minority stress model predicted. In fact, nearly all psychological and physical problems persist at just about the same rate they did before the gay rights movement.

According to Meyer’s study, “we found little evidence that the social and legal improvements during the past 50 years … have altered the experience of sexual minorities people in terms of exposure to minority stressors and resultant adverse mental health outcomes.” Younger cohorts have higher suicide attempt rates (30 percent) than the older cohort (21 percent). The younger group reports more everyday discrimination, more psychological distress, more stigma, and more internalized homophobia. All in all, according to these scholars, “our findings are clearly inconsistent with the [minority stress] hypothesis.”

In another study, J. Michael Bailey, an early adopter of the minority stress model in the 1990s, could find “no evidence to support” minority stress predictions and, he acknowledges, that “there is much evidence against it.”

Greater tolerance of sexual minorities has not led to better health outcomes or lower suicide rates or to decreases in neuroticism among gay men. Health and psychological results in the tolerant Netherlands, Bailey points out, are not much different from the results of the supposedly intolerant United States. Suicide rates barely budged in nations that have adopted same-sex marriage.

Appealing to widely-accepted values like safety and prevention in order to promote sexual identity education to children was a deliberate rhetorical strategy from LGBT advocates. Kevin Jennings, founder of the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network (GLSEN), delivered a speech to gay activists on March 5, 1995, laying out the strategy:

If the Radical Right can succeed in portraying us as preying on children, we will lose. Their language — ‘promoting homosexuality’ is one example — is laced with subtle and not-so-subtle innuendo that we are ‘after their kids.’ We must learn from the abortion struggle, where the clever claiming of the term ‘pro-life’ allowed those who opposed abortion on demand to frame the issue to their advantage… We immediately seized upon the opponent’s calling card — safety — and explained how homophobia represents a threat to students’ safety by creating a climate where violence, name-calling, health problems, and suicide are common.

GLSEN developed “Safe Space Kits” under Jennings’ leadership. It supplied these kits to schools free of charge. These kits recommended the establishment of ally clubs, playing short films, and using gay-friendly lesson plans and special LGBT themed books in classes. They were all designed to address anti-LGBT prejudice. It was all about prevention.

For Meyer, continued psychological and physiological health disparities are sufficient to show that minorities must be stressed. As they put it, their findings “call attention to the continued need to recognize threats to the health and well-being of sexual minority people across all ages and to remind us that LGBT equality remains elusive.”

Clearly, the only answer LGBT advocates see is to step on the gas. We must accelerate the sexual revolution and expand sexual identity awareness education to ever earlier ages in order to relieve the stress of sexual minorities. Improvements in their health and safety will only come when the sexual revolution has achieved its end. Even incremental improvements cannot be expected until then.

Sexual revolutionaries care about the revolution — not safety or prevention, so all data to the contrary will be ignored or turned to the advantage of the revolution. We see this in the current monkeypox debate, where the transmission of the disease is obscured so as not to stigmatize the gay community by calling attention to certain extreme sexual practices that many gays consider essential to their identity. Whereas masking and social isolation were widely accepted as the indicated means to prevent the spread of Covid, asking gay men to limit their sexual activity to stop the spread of monkeypox is called unrealistic and hateful.

Scientists who are interested in reality must see that health problems are endemic in the gay community, and not because of a lack of sensitivity on the part of society. Suicide is more prevalent precisely because of dynamics sown into rejecting one’s body as a guide to one’s identity. Anal cancer among gay men is not caused by stigma.

When confronted with reality, sexual revolutionaries embrace an endless, rolling revolution. Science is not likely to guide us out of the revolution, but a willingness to see will — and sometimes science still would have us see.

Pastors Across America Fight Transgender Shows For Kids,"At the end of this article is an image in which nudity has been obscured.

This summer, small public libraries in Illinois and a zoo in Montana joined a growing number of taxpayer-supported institutions to feature men wearing provocative women’s clothing at events marketed to children. These “drag queen story hours” can feature children as young as babies tucking money in cross-dressers’ scant clothing and learning to pole dance.

Multiple cross-dressing school and library performers have later been found to have committed sex crimes against children. Others included performers cuddling and apparently flashing children. Such LGBT-themed events and corresponding children’s books are pushed by groups like the American Library Association and teachers unions, which receive large amounts of funding from taxpayers.

What’s notable about the Montana and Illinois drag events for children was the quickly organized community pushback. In Illinois, local libraries’ recent Pride Month drag events resulted in volunteers gathering enough signatures to put taxpayer-funded drag shows for kids as a referendum item on this November’s ballot.

Showdown in Saint Louis

Madison County, where three library drag events occurred this summer, is a Republican-leaning suburb of Saint Louis, Missouri. Madison County board Chairman Kurt Prenzler, a Republican, told The Federalist he collected approximately 200 signatures by going door to door. Most people he encountered had no idea nearby public libraries had held drag queen events just a few weeks prior, he said.

It wasn’t for lack of drama. The appearances sparked a “peaceful prayer protest” at a nearby church, a statement from local pastors, fears of violence, and police presence at the events. Prenzler was targeted for a hit profile last week by the Saint Louis Post-Dispatch.

Due to local outcry, one of the two performers decided to do his reading for the Collinsville, Illinois library via Zoom instead of in person. The other performer did two events at the Glen Carbon, Illinois public library, on June 7 and 21. His social media and website contain plenty of eye-popping details that objecting locals sent to librarians before the event, a records request from The Federalist uncovered.

Email to librarians opposing the drag performance.

Anyone who searched online for the performer with the stage name Maxi Glamour could find him advertising himself as a “non-binary polka demon” and displaying anti-religious sentiment that would get him canceled if it were anti-gay. His website links to a 2018 Saint Louis NPR profile that notes his performances include “stripping down to a G-string.” The article included a photo of Maxi Glamour gripping his naked buttocks during a show.

Another 2018 Saint Louis NPR article chronicling Glamour’s drag performance at a Saint Louis public library, also linked on his website, indicates he sees his performances at least partly as LGBT recruitment and public relations: “For performer Maxi Glamour, dressing in drag also serves as a way to introduce young audiences to LGBTQ culture and identity. ‘Drag queens are the spearheads of queer culture to some extent,’ [Glamour] said.”

“This is not a program about sexual behaviors,” Glen Carbon Library Director Christine Gerrish told The Federalist in a phone interview about the drag events. “These are programs about accepting people who are different, and overcoming stereotypes.”

Gerrish responded quickly to The Federalist’s interview and open records requests. She also told The Federalist, “We do not background check or anything like that any of our performers; very few libraries do.”

One of the tamer images from the performer’s social media. Others sent to librarians, according to records The Federalist obtained, included nudity, explicit sexual content, illicit drug use, and anti-Christian profanity.

Cross-Library Marketing Push

While LGBT programming bothers some library patrons, it delights others, Gerrish said, and the library strives to offer “something for everyone”: “Generally for an adult program we are lucky to get 10 people. We have 60 registered” for Glamour’s adults-only evening program at the library. The number of participants in the children’s storytime was not available, she told The Federalist in an email, because “We do not take registrations for Storytime events.”

The records showed librarians marketing the drag events to regional youth librarians, LGBT clubs in public schools, and LGBT support groups. One such group a Collinsville librarian contacted to recruit event attendees partners with abortion giant Planned Parenthood to supply people with cross-sex hormones.

The emails also show Glen Carbon Youth Services Director Aimee Villet advertised her library’s drag storytime on a regional listserv for youth librarians. Her subject line was “Drag for Pride.”

“Feel free to attend either program and share this information with any of your families or patrons who may be interested,” she told fellow youth librarians on public payrolls. The emails show she received positive messages back from other librarians.

Pastors: ‘A World Gone Mad’

Upon being alerted their libraries were to feature these performers, local pastors were at first stunned but then quickly took action, said Heath Curtis, the pastor of both Trinity and Zion Lutheran churches in nearby Worden and Carpenter, Illinois.

“It sounds silly that it caught us off guard, but it caught us off guard. We’re very much small-town America, and didn’t really think anyone would be pushing this in our community,” Curtis told The Federalist in a phone interview.

Soon after fellow pastors began discussing the news by text and email, Curtis drafted a statement. The pastors quickly circulated it for signatures, then released it to local media, which included it in their coverage. The emails The Federalist obtained from librarians show them noticing how effective the pastors’ media outreach was in elevating local dissent and generating coverage in multiple local outlets that resulted in reporter phone calls to the libraries.

The pastors also joined a local Assemblies of God church’s public event protesting public institutions sexualizing children. There, they read their statement.

“Inviting a drag queen to perform for children is intended to introduce children to sexually explicit themes. In the words of the Illinois statute, it is ‘prurient.’ It is contrary to common sense, natural law, and all that is good and holy,” the statement says. “…Our communities deserve better from their public servants. We strive to make our churches places of refuge from a world gone mad.”

Curtis noted the church scheduled its public prayer two hours earlier than the storytime to avoid the appearance of threatening attendees. He also said it is all Christians’ duty to work to prevent sexual evils from being perpetrated against the most vulnerable in society, including children and those with destabilized senses of identity due often to trauma.

“It is the church’s prophetic role to stand up and say what is right and wrong in society,” Curtis told The Federalist. “Also to make sure people understand that the gospel calls for repentance and forgiveness of sins.”

Curtis said he hopes more Christians come together locally and across denominational lines to protect the innocence of children and the use of public institutions to destabilize people’s identities: “If sexualizing and sexually grooming children isn’t your bright line for the church to speak publicly, I want to know what your bright line is.”

From Illinois to Montana

The pastors in Illinois also inspired action all the way across the United States, thanks to denominational connections. An entire church body in Montana used phrases from the Illinois pastors’ letter in their public objections to another June drag show for children, stating, “Each child deserves the protection and care not only of his parents, but also of the community at large and it is simply evil to expose children to sexually explicit themes.”

The letter from the Montana district of the Bible-confessing Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod denomination was followed by its president, Rev. Terry Forke, writing to local newspapers about a drag show for kids held on June 22 at Zoo Montana: “Christians do not warn their neighbors against unhealthy behaviors because they hate them. Christians, above all, want what is best for their neighbors,” Forke wrote.

The Montana Family Alliance, Dick Pence of Big Sky Worldview Forum, and the Montana Family Rights Alliance Facebook group spread the word about the drag show and the names of large zoo sponsors so people could voice their opinions about the event.

Multiple pastors also joined a peaceful protest of approximately 200 people at the zoo. Pastor Willis McCall of Mount Olive Lutheran Church in Billings, Montana, participated and said public statements and protests are good, yet Christians should also do more.

“Yes, Bible studies are great. But if it’s just a Bible study at your church with everybody there who probably agrees with you, how do you put that into action and actually impact people in your community who don’t know that?” McCall prompted.

Pastors need to equip their people to talk to their friends and neighbors about our culture’s sexual chaos. And all Christians need to make a point to proclaim their moral reasoning in public, host counter-events such as their own public readings of the Bible and high-quality literary works, and work politically to protect children from sexual aggression, McCall suggested.

That means “one of the best first things you can do is get your kids out of public school. You cannot come up with a good reason to put them in,” he told The Federalist. That’s because children don’t belong on the frontlines of spiritual battles; adults do.

Walking the Talk

Back in Collinsville and Glen Carbon, Illinois, locals are already putting McCall’s thoughts into action, not only with the ballot question but also with challenges to local library trustees who won’t act to protect children.

“Shall tax-supported libraries and schools promote drag queen events to minors?” reads the question that will appear on November’s local ballots thanks to local signature-gatherers.

Collecting signatures and placing the question on ballots helps educate townspeople on what their institutions are doing, Prenzler said, since many still don’t know. It also sets the stage for the library trustees’ elections in April.

“What I really hope happens in our community, is that the people in these conservative traditional biblical churches, I hope we sweep the library board elections next time,” Curtis said. “I am very much against retreating to the Christian ghetto. We need to speak, we need to pray, and we need to act.”",https://thefederalist.com/2022/08/30/parents-and-pastors-across-america-fight-drag-shows-for-kids/,2022-08-30
‘So Excited’: Emails Show Librarians Plotting Drag Shows For Kids,"Emails from librarians who brought cross-dressing performers to Republican-leaning Saint Louis suburbs this summer illustrate how easy it is for a few public employees to hijack tax-funded resources to promote sexual behaviors to children.

Emails obtained by The Federalist show just a few local librarians in Collinsville and Glen Carbon, Illinois, working with other librarians to use their public positions to promote personal causes. The Collinsville and Glen Carbon Centennial public libraries this summer featured “drag queen storytime” events on June 3, 7, and 21 to promote homosexual “Pride Month.”

National surveys show the profession is overwhelmingly white and female — 87 and 81 percent, respectively, in a 2014 American Library Association (ALA) survey. That’s the same demographic becoming Democrats’ most significant voting bloc and often the most likely to push identity politics, often for personal psychological reasons.

While the ALA recently urged librarians whose communities don’t want public institutions to push sexual information on kids to “sneak” LGBT materials in, these librarians wanted to go further. They wanted more than a Pride Month display that merely puts sex books at toddlers’ eye level. They wanted drag shows for kids.

Librarians All-In for Exposing Kids

The obtained emails indicate professional librarians’ networks enthusiastically assisted with creating and promoting these events. February 2022 emails The Federalist obtained through an open-records request in June show Glen Carbon youth librarian Aimee Villet asking Saint Louis librarians to recommend drag performers to hire: “[W]ould love to offer a Drag Queen storytime at our library,” Villet wrote.

The emails show Villet also wrote seeking drag performer names from Library Director Ashley Stewart in nearby Caseyville, Illinois, which featured a drag performance last year.

The response Stewart sent back wasn’t shown in the records returned, but a follow-up from Villet was. It shows the librarians expected negative feedback from local taxpayers but wouldn’t allow it to affect their plans.

“LGBTQIA+ programming for kids always leads to complaints,” Villet acknowledged. But, as she and Collinsville children’s librarian Sam Camero agreed in other emails, they were “prepared for hard conversations,” as Villet put it to Camero on May 18.

Villet ultimately obtained a link to drag performer Maxi Glamour’s contact page from Saint Louis Public Library Youth Services Manager Joe Monahan, the emails show. The performer’s IMDB page says he also goes by Max Wright. Villet booked Wright for two events in the Glen Carbon Centennial Library this summer — one for children and one for adults only.

“We want to do something special this year [for Pride Month] beyond our usual displays and passive programs,” Villet told Wright.

Glen Carbon Library Director Christine Gerrish told The Federalist the library paid Wright $300 for the two events.

‘So Excited’

The emails show multiple librarians expressing enthusiasm and anticipation for Wright’s drag performance.

“I was so excited when Aimee brought up the idea to have you come to our library,” Glen Carbon librarian Betsye Stinson wrote on March 8 to the drag performer. She suggested that his adults-only event at the Glen Carbon library promote activist causes by sharing “more about the history of Drag in STL [Saint Louis], hearing about your personal interest, and providing insight on how to be a better ally and how to support and uplift marginalized QTPOC members in our community.”

The like-minded librarians eagerly plotted their 2022 LGBT programming and especially the drag storytime together, according to the emails. Librarians from different towns eagerly offered to help promote each others’ LGBT events and offered emotional as well as strategic support for the community backlash they all expected.

The librarians also coordinated on responding to community objections to the events once they were announced, the emails show. The executive director of Collinsville’s public libraries, Kyla Waltermire, reached out to nearby Glen Carbon Library Director Christine Gerrish after local Republican politician Kurt Prenzler objected to their drag events on his email list. They decided not to publicly respond.

Drag Spreads One Suburb Over

In Collinsville, Waltermire started preparing for her library’s separate summer drag performance in February, the emails show. Waltermire uses the salutation “Mx” and specifies the pronouns “she/her” in her email signature. Collinsville is another Republican-leaning suburb of Saint Louis.

On Valentine’s Day, Waltermire also emailed Caseyville library director Stewart. In 2021, Caseyville featured a drag storytime for kids by a cross-dresser with the stage name Chasity Valentino. In the emails, the two discuss how to “coordinate” and “cross promote” the drag programming.

“I’d like to pick your brain about what you learned from Caseyville’s experience – what to plan for, how to respond to critics, etc,” Waltermire wrote Stewart.

Some of the Caseyville librarians “are members of the LGBTQ+ community and they would love to help in ANY way with flyers, materials, book recommendations, resources, community partners, etc.,” Stewart wrote Gerrish. “…As a director, please do not hesitate to reach out to me if you begin to receive negative feedback and would like some assistance and go-to responses.”

Thanks to the recommendations from Caseyville’s Stewart, Collinsville also featured Valentino. Valentino was initially scheduled for an in-person performance in Collinsville but ultimately decided to read virtually, alleging concerns about safety once his performance became known in the local community.

More Public Employees Help Out

The emails also show how LGBT clubs in local public schools function as political outposts to help recruit volunteers and audience members for sexually charged events such as drag storytime.

On May 6, Waltermire wrote special education teacher Cathy Kulupka, the gay-straight club sponsor at Collinsville High School, to say, “Based on how a similar event at the Caseyville Public Library was received last year, we are anticipating protesters” at their June 3 drag show. “Would the GSA be able to support this program by attending the storytime and/or by assisting at the library’s entrances to welcome and direct families to the storytime?”

Kulupka wrote back less than an hour later, “Absolutely!”

“Let me talk to my students more and see, but I have mentioned it and they are down…I will prep them on how to behave and to not react to protesters…we can meet and discuss details further. Sidenote: I am super excited about this!” Kulupka wrote Waltermire on May 9 after further back and forth.

Camero, whose work email signature tells people to use plural, third-person pronouns for her as well as the gender-queer salutation “Mx,” promoted Collinsville’s drag storytime to multiple organizations and contacts. In one email, Camero refers to the event as “my Drag Queen Story Time program” and comments that she is “really excited, and I want to get the word out!”

Another email from Camero to a librarian about a half hour away at Hayner Public Library in Alton, Illinois, invites the fellow librarian to the event as a personal matter.

“I hope they’ll be able to get enough info and will see the support and be able to convince their director to let them try a DQST too,” Camero writes in another email redacted so as to obscure what other librarians she appears to be encouraging to host more drag performances.

Camero also emailed local LGBT organizations to recruit attendees, enabling the librarians to tell library trustees and others including The Federalist that there was a high interest in the program as measured by very strong attendance compared to other library programs. The emails show she reached out both to the Metro Trans Umbrella Group of Saint Louis, which partners with abortion industry giant Planned Parenthood to distribute disability-producing opposite-sex hormones, and the Southwest Illinois chapter of TransParentUSA to ask their members to come to Collinsville’s library drag performance. Both organizations are located outside Collinsville.

While a number of the public employees involved appear to have personal motivations for pushing these performances, they are a divisive issue even among people who support LGBT behaviors. Prenzler told The Federalist that his friend, a gay man who married his partner two years ago, signed a local referendum that successfully put the drag shows onto November’s ballots in Glen Carbon: “His point was, this is not for kids and it brings shame on the gay community.”

Two lesbians joined several other locals this summer in going door to door to collect signatures to put the referendum on ballots, Prenzler, chairman of surrounding Madison County, also said: “Both of them thought this was outrageous, it was inappropriate.” While collecting some 200 signatures for the initiative, Prenzler said he noticed that the majority of those who answered their doors had not heard about the local drag events even though they were extremely controversial locally.

Emails Show Multiple Complaints from Locals

The Federalist asked for all Glen Carbon library records containing the terms “Maxi Glamour,” “Max Wright,” “drag queen,” “and/or the dates ‘June 7’ and ‘June 21’ over the last six months; and any other reasonably available library records from the last six months that contain the terms ‘Maxi Glamour’ and/or ‘Max Wright.’” Gerrish, Glen Carbon’s library director, is responsible for collecting and disclosing the records requested by the public about her own and her staff’s activities.

It appears from the records that she allowed library staff to select the records disclosed from their work email accounts in response to the requested open-records search. This setup effectively allows public employees to oversee legally mandated disclosures of their own activities, a clear conflict of interest.

A Federalist review of the records Gerrish returned also shows both multiple complaints and positive notes about the drag show from locals. Some complaints include pictures of Wright’s social media pages where he displays a sex toy, nudity, and illicit drug use as well as making profane comments about Christianity.

“Unfortunately, after researching this person further, I discovered there is also a video on Maxi Glamour’s social media of Maxi bathing while completely nude with genitalia exposed. This post was from January 2022,” wrote one alarmed community member to Villet in May.

When The Federalist asked Gerrish what her line would be for deciding whether specific content was too risqué for sponsoring with public resources, she responded, “Personally I generally go by PG-13 and milder. This performer is providing that tomorrow night and much milder for the children.”

Trustees Refuse to Stop Drag Shows for Kids

The emails also show members of both libraries’ boards of trustees discussing community reactions to the event. In Collinsville, Waltermire sent trustees a list of talking points about the event in response to community backlash.

An email from Collinsville library board Vice President Laura Gottschalk to Waltermire includes screenshots from the Collinsville mayor’s wife, Diane Miller, expressing concerns about the drag show: “I cannot fathom you would have voted to allow this,” Miller texts Gottschalk. Later in the conversation, Miller appears to relent a bit, texting Gottschalk, “I agree. Parents should decide on this.”

Glen Carbon Board Vice President Marcella Starck and Trustee Kevin Tellor forwarded to Gerrish both positive and negative emails they received from local residents, and Gerrish did the same with the entire board, at their request.

The emails also show the trustees were aware before the program occurred of the drag performer’s public pornographic materials available to anyone who searched for his stage name. Tellor forwarded to Gerrish the below email that included explicit photos backing up the community member’s claims.

Regardless of this foreknowledge, the Glen Carbon Centennial Library trustees did not step in to stop the in-person drag programs. The Collinsville trustees also allowed the drag performer to read to children from their library’s online platform and be promoted under their library’s name all over town and the Saint Louis suburbs.

Utah LGBT Group Sponsors 'All Ages' Back-to-School Drag Show,"Image Credit Raynbow Collective/Screenshot

Warning: This article contains graphic content.

A Utah nonprofit is sponsoring a “Back to School Pride Drag Extravaganza” on Saturday with performers whose names sound like “anal leakage” and “genitalia” when pronounced.

The Provo-based LGBT group, “RaYnbow Collective,” is promoting the performance as an “ALL AGES, Family-Friendly Drag Show” on its flyers.

https://twitter.com/MorganZegers/status/1565061062172475392?s=20&t=OaCbVRJ-bHvq8HLyBRgSSA

The RaYnbow Collective did not respond to The Federalist’s inquiry about how the organization can guarantee the show will be “family-friendly.”

Drag shows nationwide have sparked criticism for advertising events as kid-friendly while dancers offer sexually explicit performances to underage children who have even been encouraged to tip.

One bar in Dallas, Texas, is under investigation by the state comptroller’s office after the venue featured performers accepting cash from children under a neon sign that reportedly reads, “it’s not gonna lick itself.”

I want to hear the loony left, liberal logic defend this absurdity. Taking children to a strip club. The sign in the club: “It’s Not Going To Lick Itself.” The theme: “Drag The Kids To Pride Drag Show.” Defend it. Go ahead. See for yourself. Kids give drag queens dollar bills. pic.twitter.com/Qnt7Q6GKOs — Stefan Mychajliw (@StefanMychajliw) June 7, 2022

“Like many Texas parents, I was disturbed by the recent images showing children participating in a drag show in the Dallas area, including one image of a child placing money in a performer’s undergarment,” said Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar in a statement last month.

Another establishment in the Dallas area held a kids’ drag brunch guarded by armed Antifa activists who clashed with protesters outside the event.

The drag performances come as the LGBT movement pivots from focusing on same-sex marriage to targeting impressionable children who then become confused about their own biology and pursue permanent trans surgeries. Boston Children’s Hospital has advertised these procedures for minors as young as 15.

Emails The Federalist obtained from a public library in Illinois reveal activists eager to put on drag performances for children.

Yeshiva University Goes To SCOTUS To Preserve Religious Liberty,"Must religious institutions abandon certain core tenets to operate in the public square? That question is at the heart of yet another lawsuit arising from the tensions between religious liberty and anti-discrimination laws.

This week, New York’s Yeshiva University — an Orthodox Jewish university — filed an emergency application to the U.S. Supreme Court after a state supreme court judge ordered the school to recognize an LGBT student group in violation of its religious beliefs regarding sexual morality. Yeshiva has asked for a stay of the lower court decision’s ruling pending their appeal. In the alternative, it has asked for a petition for writ of certiorari so the high court can order briefing and arguments and consider the full case on its merits.

Yeshiva maintains that the “message of Torah on [the LGBT] issue is nuanced, both accepting each individual with love and affirming its timeless prescriptions.” Accordingly, although Yeshiva admits LGBT students, as it is “wholly committed to and guided by Halacha and Torah values,” it cannot lend its “own name or seal of approval” to clubs that appear “[in]consistent with [its] Torah values.” Likewise, Yeshiva has declined to approve “proposed student clubs involving shooting, videogames, and gambling,” as well as a proposed chapter of the Jewish fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi.

The case, YU Pride Alliance v. Yeshiva University centers not on whether Yeshiva’s decision to decline to recognize the student club was a religious one since all parties agree that it was but on whether Yeshiva itself is a religious corporation for purposes of the New York City Human Rights Law. That law prohibits any “place or provider of public accommodation” from discriminating based on, among other things, actual or perceived gender and sexual orientation.

The plaintiffs argued that Yeshiva had violated the law by refusing to recognize their student group, admitting that in the creation of the group, they sought to alter Yeshiva’s religious environment. Yeshiva countered that it was a “religious corporation incorporated under the education law” as defined in section 8-102 of the human rights law, making it exempt. YU Pride disagreed, and State Supreme Court Justice Lynn Kotler sided with the student group.

Yeshiva’s motto — “Torah Umadda” — reflects its core mission: the pursuit of rigorous religious and secular studies. All students engage in high-level study of Hebrew scripture, the Talmud, and the vast corpus of Jewish texts. The academic calendar is in harmony with the Jewish calendar, observing the Sabbath and all Jewish holy days. The campuses are sex-segregated in accordance with Jewish law, the food offered is strictly kosher, doorways have mezuzot affixed, and each student has a mashgiach ruchani (spiritual advisor).

Yet despite these facts, Kotler ruled in June that the Manhattan-based university was not organized as a “religious corporation” and was therefore subject to the New York City Human Rights Law. For her conclusion, she relied on amendments to Yeshiva’s 1967 charter declaring that it was “an educational corporation under the education law of the State of New York … organized and operated exclusively for educational purposes.” She added that, in addition to Yeshiva’s failure to organize for expressly “religious purposes” as required under New York Law, the university confers “many secular multi-disciplinary degrees,” making education Yeshiva’s primary purpose. In the judge’s view, it seems “educational purposes” include neither religious education nor the use of secular education for religious purposes.

Kotler issued a permanent injunction against the university, ordering it to immediately grant the YU Pride Alliance “full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges afforded to all other student groups at Yeshiva.” Yeshiva’s two motions to stay the injunction were denied by New York appellate courts.

A forthcoming law review article by Emory University Law Professor Michael J. Broyde explains how universities that incorporate under secular charters face challenges in claiming the religious status that might exempt them from otherwise generally applicable anti-discrimination laws.

These “secularly chartered but religiously motivated” universities are often caught in a pickle: discrimination against funding religious institutions leads to a financial need for a secular charter. But then a secular charter leads to difficulty in receiving a religious exemption from anti-discrimination laws.

There should be no pickle. As Chief Justice John Roberts opined in Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue (2020), “A state need not subsidize private education. But once a state decides to do so, it cannot disqualify some private schools solely because they are religious.” To discriminate against them by requiring them to choose between their religion or access to public funding for which they would otherwise qualify as “odious to the Constitution.” The same standard should apply to religious universities.

But despite whatever ambiguity might currently exist in these scenarios, Yeshiva argues that it is a university’s religious status that ought to win the day.

In Yeshiva’s emergency petition to the Supreme Court, Eric Baxter of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty argued that the state court “cursorily rejected” its First Amendment Free Exercise Clause claim. He argued that the school is quintessentially religious, writing that the entire Yeshiva undergraduate experience is designed to form students in the Jewish faith.

Baxter continued:

[W]hen the secular authorities of New York purport to overrule the religious authorities at Yeshiva — and when the civil courts insist the First Amendment has nothing to say about the matter — something has gone terribly wrong. And when those courts also insist upon ‘immediate’ obedience by religious authorities to civil ones, this Court’s intervention is urgently needed to preserve the status quo and protect Applicants’ religious character, at least until such time as this Court can consider the case on its merits.

Among the questions presented to the Supreme Court, Yeshiva asks whether the New York law can override Yeshiva’s religious judgment on what groups to recognize. It also queries whether the New York law is “neutral” and “generally applicable” as required by Employment Division v. Smith (1990), and alternatively, whether Smith ought to be overruled.

This is the second time Employment Division v. Smith has made an appearance at the Supreme Court in as many years. In 2021’s Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, the court clarified that under Smith, a law may burden religion if it is neutral and generally applicable, but if not, then the burden on religion must be justified by a compelling government interest. Ultimately, the Fulton Court held that the city’s refusal to contract with a Catholic foster service agency was not pursuant to a neutral and generally applicable law because its policy allowed for exceptions to the anti-discrimination requirement at the sole discretion of the Philadelphia Commissioner.

Yeshiva’s emergency application was filed with Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who handles emergency matters in the Second Circuit. She can rule on the application or refer it to the full court. Defenders of the free exercise of religion in public life should pay close attention to what the court does next.

Disney Aims More Propaganda At Kids With 'DWTS' Drag Queen,"In a move that shouldn’t come as a surprise due to Disney’s penchant for targeting children with sexual propaganda, season 31 of “Dancing with the Stars” features a drag queen. In the season premiere on Monday, drag queen “Shangela” and partner Gleb Savchenko earned raving praise from the judges and tied for third overall out of 16 couples.

Allowing a drag performer to compete, and with a male pro dancer no less, is just another part of a systemic effort by Disney — which now hosts “Dancing with the Stars” on Disney Plus — to push the entertainment giant’s perverted sexual agenda on kids.

Meet ‘Shangela’

Shangela is a 40-year-old man named Darius Pierce. Pierce grew up in Paris, Texas, and was raised by a single Army vet mother. He was part of his church’s choir as a child but was exposed to drag at the early age of 16 for a school project. He became famous after competing on three seasons of “RuPaul’s Drag Race.”

Pierce says he identifies as queer and gay. While he doesn’t claim to be transgender himself, he is on board with indoctrinating children with trans ideology.

During a “Jeopardy!”-inspired “Drag Queen Edition” game show earlier this year, contestants were asked to identify which governor “compared gender-affirming care to child abuse.” Without missing a beat, Pierce buzzed in and said, “I think what she means is that tyrant fool known as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.” He went on to praise GLAAD (Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) for “rallying Hollywood and the news media to fight back against anti-trans legislation in Texas and all across the country.”

He also groomed his 9-year-old goddaughter Hailey for her “Toddlers and Tiaras” pageant and can be seen doing a model walk in front of children while in full drag. In the video, his goddaughter says, “I think drag queens are cool. They’re like role models.”

Disney, ‘DWTS’ Refuse to Listen to Audiences

This kind of sexual propaganda is not what most of Disney’s target audience wants hurled at them every time they turn on the television. Disney made the same mistake with its “Lightyear” fiasco. Filmmakers infused a children’s movie with LGBT propaganda, and the film tanked. Of course, the entertainment media and Disney itself pretended the film’s failure had nothing to do with politics, but they are in for a reality check.

In rehearsals with pro partner Gleb Savchenko, Pierce looks like any male you would see on the street (albeit flamboyant), but in interviews and performances, he is dressed like a woman. When I first looked through the photos of cast members, I had no idea Pierce was a drag performer. How much more confused would children be?

While Savchenko and Pierce will be the first all-male pair in “DWTS” history, the show’s sexual agenda didn’t start this year. The first all-female pair was featured last year in season 30 when gay child icon JoJo Siwa was paired with “DWTS” pro Jenna Johnson.

Many were unhappy with this pairing, and it is one of the factors that led to season 30 having record low views. The premiere garnered a little over 5 million viewers, down 33 percent from season 29.

Apparently, show executives didn’t learn their lesson.

How Dancing Drag Queens Confuse and Harm Kids

Parents are tired of having their children targeted by gross sexual propaganda, everywhere from entertainment platforms like Disney Plus to classrooms. Allowing this kind of content is damaging to kids and even outright evil. All subtlety is gone, and in its place is a megaphone shouting through the television that traditional marriage and a traditional view of sex are not only one option of many now but outdated, weird, and uncool.

As if it wasn’t hard enough for parents to fight a behemoth of institutions from education to entertainment pushing sexual confusion, they have to do so in a world that is used to celebrating licentiousness even apart from an LGBT agenda. Our bawdy culture has been steeped in so much sexual excess that heterosexual people dressing like strippers are seen as normal, especially in entertainment. The step to homosexual people dressing similarly or cross-dressing is unfortunately not that large of a leap.

Men and women were created differently and to fulfill a specific purpose. Likewise, sexuality is a weighty and beautiful part of being human, designed to be enjoyed in ordered ways, not to be abused or commercialized. For left-leaning entertainment giants to twist the truth and celebrate sexual confusion harms the very people they claim to affirm. Sexual confusion is not something to be excited about. We should be lovingly showing people where their worth and inherent identity comes from, not pushing them further into a damaging and evil lifestyle.

Now that “DWTS” has started this trend, chances are there will be at least one same-sex dance partnership each season from here on out. And because it is considered a family-friendly show, children who have access to Disney Plus accounts will be able to watch the series without parental knowledge.

How Activists Use Your Tax Dollars To Sexualize Kids At School,"Federal grants are funding the interest groups spearheading efforts to “queer” education around the country. These groups are hijacking laws with sensible-sounding aims and attempting to create revolutionary changes in sexuality.

Federal programs such as the Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) and Title V Sexual Risk Avoidance Education (SRAE) funnel money to state health and welfare departments. Seeing that there is money to be captured, education nonprofits such as Education, Training and Research (ETR), Planned Parenthood, and others develop curriculum and training to deliver the “prevention” programs. Then state health and welfare departments bypass state departments of education and local school boards by providing these curricula to public health agencies, which then provide “sex ed” curriculum directly to schools.

These nonprofits push the theory that sexual repression is to blame for sexually transmitted diseases and unintended pregnancy and they hold that greater and earlier openness about sexuality and more inclusivity will prevent all evils. Their curricula encourage sexualizing children as a preventive measure. They believe they occupy the moral high ground: opposing their sexualization of children means encouraging disease, suicide, and unwanted pregnancy.

ETR provides a case study for how this perverse federalism works. ETR’s Reducing the Risk curriculum promises to teach abstinence, but instead delivers a Planned Parenthood-endorsed “LGBTQ inclusive” curriculum that queers education with an emphasis on “gender identity, sexual orientation and behavior.” ETR advocates for teaching elementary students “porn literacy” and shows teachers how to teach “kink and power, pleasure, sexual identity, sexual acts and sexual exploration in relation to pornography.” It also delivers an “LGBTQ centered” curriculum that takes sex education beyond condoms to dental dams, sex toys, and perilous transgender radicalism.

Nearly every state agency that has accepted SRAE and PREP funds has purchased ETR’s curriculum. ETR’s new LGBTQ-centered program, developed with Planned Parenthood, is already operating in 16 states.

Idaho as an Example

Idaho offers an example of how increasingly radical content can be smuggled into school programs while avoiding public scrutiny. Under the two programs PREP and SRAE, Idaho had around $2 million in federal funding in both fiscal years 2021 and 2022.

The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare uses such funding for ETR’s queer-focused Reducing the Risk curriculum through its Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Program. The department then directs local public health districts to recruit schools to implement the program. Idaho North Central Public Health District, for example, has a webpage promoting Reducing the Risk, which includes links to ETR’s trainings on porn literacy and queering sex ed. Another district resource, Sex etc., takes students to articles such as “Transgender Men Can Get Pregnant, Too,” surveys about masturbation, and Amaze.Org videos featuring cartoon depictions of porn and abortion. What parent thinks to check their local public health district’s website to learn what their child is taught about sex in schools?

Programs in Many States Partnered with Planned Parenthood

In addition to Idaho, the federal government reports schools and health departments in Montana, Florida, Arizona, New York, Utah, South Carolina, and Alabama, among many others, have adopted ETR’s LGBT-focused programs such as All4You, Making A Difference! and Reducing the Risk.

Planned Parenthood facilities often partner with state agencies to help implement these programs in schools. For instance, Planned Parenthood of South, East, and North Florida offers ETR’s Reducing the Risk curriculum in Duval, Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade counties in before- and after-school, in-school, and community-based settings.

Action Needed

Schools are accepting curricula from interest groups pushing the sexualization of our children. Not only should citizens demand that their school districts take a proactive role in discovering what state-recommended resources are being used, but state legislators should analyze federal programs with stricter scrutiny to ensure that they do not corrupt our children.

LGBT Group Against Child Sexualization Is Big Tech's New Target,"A gay coalition group against the sexualization and indoctrination of children by the modern left-wing LGBT movement has now become the target of tech giants including Google, PayPal, Venmo, and Twitter, which have shut off online services.

The group, “Gays Against Groomers,” was blacklisted by PayPal and Venmo, the latter of which is owned by PayPal, over apparent violations of the two companies’ Acceptable Use policies. Neither firm, however, specified which policies warranted the group’s banishment from their platforms.

Jaimee Michell, the founder of the group, told The Federalist she received notice that the accounts for her grassroots coalition were permanently suspended from the payment platforms around 2 a.m. Tuesday morning. Each notification came just minutes apart, she said.

“They just said we violated their user agreements, [but] they didn’t say how,” Michell said.

PayPal refused to offer any specifics in a statement to The Federalist.

“PayPal has a long-standing and consistent Acceptable Use Policy,” said a company representative. “We take action when we deem that individuals or organizations have violated this policy. Per company policy, PayPal does not disclose specific account information for current or former customers.”

In another statement to the radical left-wing LGBT paper Advocate, PayPal characterized Gays Against Groomers as a discriminatory “hate” group.

“PayPal’s policy is not to allow our services to be used for activities that promote hate, violence, or discriminatory intolerance,” a company spokesman said. “We base our reviews of accounts on these parameters, taking action when we deem that individuals or organizations have violated this policy.”

Michell disputed the defamatory portrayal of her organization, which was created to oppose the overt sexualization of children by the radical transgender movement. The group officially became a registered nonprofit hours before its exile from the financial services.

“We have trans people in our organization,” Michell, who is gay, told The Federalist. “Obviously, we are not a hate group.”

While Michell’s group can no longer use PayPal, the payment processor still allows on its platform a pro-pedophilia community called “MAP,” which stands for “minor-attracted people.”

On Tuesday, Google suspended the Gays Against Groomers Gmail account for about 24 hours before it was reinstated following an appeal.

Michell told The Federalist the Gays Against Groomers Twitter account has also been suspended four times in the three months since its creation. The first suspension came two weeks after the group’s launch in June.

While the Gays Against Groomers Gmail and Twitter accounts have been restored, for now, the group remains banned from PayPal and Venmo. The crowdfunding sites Linktree and Donately have also reportedly barred the organization from their services.

“Woke homophobia is real, because that’s what it is,” Michell told The Federalist of the concerted effort to de-platform her group.

“No other LGBT organization would ever be banned from their platforms if they fell in line with this agenda,” Michell elaborated Tuesday on Fox News’s “Tucker Carlson Tonight.”

LGBT Children’s Books Drove Me From My Dream Job: Librarian,"I have a master of arts in information science and learning technology. While my children were young, I worked on my degree with the intention of securing employment in a library once my children were older. I was overjoyed to realize this dream once I was employed by my local public library. I was employed by this library for nearly five years, three of which were as the children’s collection librarian, my dream job.

Yet the inner conflict between my Christian faith and the LGBT movement that is becoming more and more prominently portrayed in newly published children’s books caused me to increasingly consider walking away from this job I worked for years to secure. That moment came a couple of weeks ago when I tearfully handed in my letter of resignation to my director.

In the letter, I stated, “I have enjoyed all aspects of my job … but it is time for me to be done. As the world continues to change its perspective in many areas, including gender identity, it has become clearer to me that I can no longer do my job effectively; my faith, and therefore my conscience, will not allow it.”

All caregivers of children who adore their library as much as I do should know that the LGBT agenda has infiltrated even books for babies, and therefore, public library children’s story times in some areas. Books for children do this now even without explicitly mentioning sex, such as this 2022 Christmas picture book about a dog owned by homosexual men. Books such as the Kitty-Corn series subtly encourage the ideology underlying transgenderism, even without mentioning sex or gender, like many other newer books libraries are buying for very young children.

Apparently aware of public disapproval of sexually themed books aimed at small children, industry book reviewers who are highly influential in library purchasing decisions are getting more deceptive in spelling this out in their book reviews. It is also getting harder for librarians to tiptoe around this topic when using these reviews (scroll down to “Editorial Reviews”) when selecting children’s books to put on the library’s shelves. This is true whether you go into a small public library like mine or into a big-city library.

This deceptiveness in both children’s book publishing and in the public library system for buying new books was making it more difficult for me to do my job confidently for my conservative rural community. It was also violating the principles upon which my faith is built, and therefore, my conscience. I cannot in good conscience use my public position and the public funds formerly entrusted to me to put books supporting gender dysphoria and sexuality on shelves where very small children browse.

When one works in a secular environment such as a public library, conservative justification for not selecting certain titles for the youngest, most vulnerable patrons can’t be heard. Making such a prudential decision to guard children’s souls from adult sexual information is seen as censorship in the library world.

I am in no way trying to demonize libraries, but I am sharing my story because sometimes, as a Christian, the best thing one can do when the world continues to “stop its ears” and “grind its teeth” (Acts 7:54–57) is to walk away and point to the cross of Christ while doing so. My library’s director hesitantly, but graciously, accepted my resignation, and I wish her no ill will.

While I believe in offering materials from differing viewpoints and was even reluctantly researching juvenile nonfiction books that tell about the LGBT movement from an unbiased historical perspective (haven’t found them yet), there is a certain line that I cannot cross. For me as a Christian and a pastor’s wife, that line is purchasing and making available to children books that falsify God’s good order of creation, His creation of male and female (Gen. 3:18-25), and His truth that we are fearfully and wonderfully made in His image (Psalm 139:14-16).

Fiction books that applaud “little Fred’s coming out” and making the “right” choice to dress up in Mommy’s clothing, complete with makeup, are becoming more and more commonplace in public libraries, and objections to such materials are professionally discouraged. As a children’s librarian, I cannot help make available such books for children today.

LGBT targeting of children is real, and it can be sneaky. Caregivers need to be aware of what is being published and what is being purchased by libraries, both school and public. We can’t shield our kids from everything, but we can be aware of what they may be exposed to and be prepared to discuss the topic when it arises — because it will at some point.

Some Christian parents are deluded to think that, just because we have “raised our children up in the way they should go,” they won’t be tempted to turn from it. Parents, please be aware of what your children are reading at the library. The Bible tells Christians to run from temptation and to protect the vulnerable, not to take it lightly.

To fellow Christians who find themselves, like me, having to turn their backs on a job they love because it creates conflicts with their Bible-instructed consciences, you can trust that God always provides for the needs of His children. The gospel reading at church the Sunday after my resignation reminded me of this.

I pray anyone who finds himself facing the same difficult decision I did will be comforted by Jesus’ words in Matthew 6:25-34: “Do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink. … For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.”

"How Much Porn Will It Take To Get Libraries, Schools Defunded?","The latest big flare-up over public education institutions sponsoring explicit sexual materials for kids occurred in Dearborn, Michigan, on Thursday. The community’s majority-Muslim school parents pitched a royal fit at two school board meetings last week over homosexual and transsexual books for kids on public school library shelves.

They verbally clashed with teachers union and other LGBT activist groups and locals. The pro-LGBT speakers insisted that attempting to keep sexually explicit materials from kids amounted to “erasing” homosexuals and transexuals and an act of “hate” against their identities.

There are few opportunities for compromise here. The two groups want exactly opposite things: more books about gay sex for kids versus no books about gay sex for kids. Even a compromise such as requiring parental approval for kids to view books about gay sex is offensive to both sides.

LGBT people told the board they view that as “erasing” their identity. They say denying support for homosexual and transsexual behavior emotionally and physically endangers children with sexual proclivities like theirs.

Traditional religious people are repulsed by being forced to subsidize the promotion of sexual behaviors their religions teach are evil and disordered and therefore will lead to human unhappiness and self-destruction. For them, being forced to subsidize sexually explicit materials for kids is in the same repellant category as being forced to subsidize abortion.

Essentially, both sides believe the other’s position enables child abuse. If you are the logical kind — and there are fewer people capable of logical thinking now, in our degraded age — you realize that both sides cannot be correct. Either one side is right that the other’s position equals child abuse, or they both are wrong. That’s a starting point for figuring out what to do.

Yet one of these sides doesn’t care about using logical tools to seek truth. It rejects the very idea of a truth that applies to all people and insists that each person is the arbiter of his own truth, his own reality, right down to where he insists on placing his body parts or even chooses to sever some. This is therefore not a practical disagreement, but a fundamental philosophical difference that really does not allow for a compromise.

That is part of why the debates over these issues are so emotional and so resistant to persuasion. People resist changing their understanding of sex (and many other fundamental realities) because they implicitly understand it would require shaking up their understanding of what is ultimately good, and it would implicate their own choices.

Our society used to be better at publicly honoring those who change their minds and facilitating discourse as a means to discover truth. That reduces the psychological barriers to being persuaded by good reason, allowing people and society to grow.

But identity politics’ cultural Marxism rejects the very idea of truth, of a fixed human nature, of eternal moralities that transcend and refine all our desires. This turns dialogue from an exercise in seeking truth for the purpose of acting upon it into an exercise of power.

Cultural Marxism discards truth for endless power plays because it rejects the source of truth, which is ultimately God. So it’s no accident that we see such public clashes between people whose fixed truth is that there is no truth outside themselves and people whose fixed truth is that the ultimate truth is outside themselves and its author is divine.

It’s impossible for these two irreconcilable frames for the world not to clash. They are fundamentally two different religions.

A societal disagreement such as this destroys the possibility of a truly public square, or any kind of society at all. The very existence of a public square requires a public — not just a collection of assorted people who happen to be in the same place, but people who share an identity.

You can’t really have a society without shared core assumptions about the world and man’s proper place in it. As the great Russell Kirk taught us, culture is a descendant of religion. Culture flows from what we worship. Some of us worship God, and some worship their own id. The latter faction in the United States has now grown and seized enough power to subjugate the former majority.

That’s ultimately the origin of our culture wars and why they are so intractable. They are a civilizational clash between the people who believe man is his own god and people who believe man is created by God and owes Him reverence.

Our culture war is religious at its root. To modify Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the dividing line between these two irreconcilable religious views runs through our own neighborhoods, cities, states, and country. And the self-deifying pagan Marxist view now controls our nation’s institutions.

Educating children is a fundamentally religious endeavor, and most American parents are sending their kids to schools that preach secular paganism. The pagan self-supremacists want to keep kiddie sex books in schools because they believe sex is an encounter with the divine — the divine self. These book-banning fights are just proxy wars over what religion will be taught to American children, as more parents discover that a religion opposed to theirs receives huge government preferences.

It will be interesting to see how much porn in schools and libraries parents are willing to tolerate before they’re done letting secularists who are so morally bankrupt as to think porn is great for kids control their kids’ education. The battle lines are already drawn in Dearborn, and that town is not alone.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/10/17/how-much-porn-do-libraries-and-schools-have-to-sponsor-to-get-defunded/,2022-10-17
VA Dem Plots To Take Kids From Parents Who Won't Trans Them,"Virginia Democrats plan to put us in prison and take our children from us if we do not endorse LGBT ideology.

Democrat Elizabeth Guzman has announced that she is introducing a bill in Virginia’s House of Delegates to “expand the state’s definition of child abuse and neglect to include parents who do not affirm their child’s gender identity or sexual orientation.” When asked about the possible penalties, Guzman replied, “It could be a felony, it could be a misdemeanor. … We know that CPS charge could harm your employment.” In short, not helping your confused adolescent daughter amputate her breasts and sterilize herself would be a crime for which the state will take your child away from you, ruin your career, and maybe lock you up.

This wicked proposal is the inevitable result of the false claims of the LGBT lobby, which have been repeated by Democrat leaders from President Biden on down. It is the logical conclusion of their assertion that children are intrinsically LGBT, and that their well-being and, indeed, their very lives, depend on the unconditional affirmation of their rainbow identities.

As I observed earlier this year, “if children are born LGBT, it follows that they should be raised by adults who will support them in these intrinsic, immutable identities. Thus, it was inevitable that the LGBT movement would begin taking children away from parents.” Guzman is just saying loudly what smarter Democrats have been whispering; she is making obvious the policies that they have been trying to implement more slowly and subtly.

The ideological root of this attack on parental rights is a sort of perverse sexual Calvinism that believes that some children are born into the rainbow elect. Scientifically this is false — the search for a “gay gene” quietly ended in failure, and there is even less evidence for a biological basis for transgender identities. Unlike sex, a person’s sexual attractions and so-called gender identity are shaped by a multitude of factors, such as the social contagion that is the transgender craze; we are not “born this way.” But the born-this-way narrative has been a potent, even decisive, weapon in the LGBT movement’s arsenal, and they are unwilling to let it go.

Consequently, the logic of this myth continues to unfold, and it cannot be confined to consenting adults, despite their previous claims to the contrary. After all, if some children are born LGBT and this is normal and good, then it is necessary to undertake intense evangelization efforts to ensure that these intrinsic and essential identities are recognized and affirmed. In the case of transgender identities, this means medical interventions including chemical and surgical sterilization as well as the amputation of healthy body parts.

The alternative, we are told, is misery and suicide. This is false, and the case for medical transition is built on junk science, but it is a potent threat. Thus, the logic of transgender ideology compels adherents to persecute parents who dissent. And so if Guzman has her way, parents who object to their children being mutilated will be jailed, and worse, lose their children.

The enforcement mechanisms are in place, and they will snare a multitude of parents. Public schools are increasingly captive to sex and gender ideologues, who have made LGBT ideology into an official dogma of American education. The result has been exponential increases in LGBT identification among children. The reasons are obvious — claiming a rainbow identity provides miserable and alienated kids with, among other things, an explanation for their unhappiness, a promise of how it can be fixed, a community that love-bombs them when they join, and a sacrosanct social identity.

Furthermore, the same activist educators pushing children to embrace rainbow identities, even behind their parents’ backs, are also mandated reporters who are required by law to inform the authorities of suspected child abuse. Thus, under Guzman’s law, as soon as a child complains to a teacher or counselor or administrator about parents who are not sufficiently affirming, that teacher has to call child protective services, who will in turn also call the cops. This system is designed to allow educators to groom children into LGBT identities and then take them from their parents, and educators who dissent from LGBT orthodoxy will be punished if they don’t join in.

Fortunately, Guzman’s vile proposal is unlikely to go anywhere, at least for now. And Virginia’s Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, has been delivering on his campaign promises to respect parental rights.

But this bill shows where the Democratic Party leadership is going. Indeed, it shows where they already are, even if some of their voters don’t know it yet. Everything they say they believe about LGBT youth, and especially about “trans kids,” demands that children be taken from parents who do not affirm rainbow identities.

Thus, Republican politicians with any integrity or intelligence must throw themselves fully into the fight to preserve parents’ rights and resist the social contagion that is maiming children. This is a righteous and popular position, and those who refuse to protect parents and children must be primaried and replaced.

As for Elizabeth Guzman and anyone else who wants to take my children from me: Molon Labe.

DOD Schools Create Woke K-12 Armies With Leftist Indoctrination,"The Pentagon’s investigation into the U.S. military in 2021 found about 100 individuals engaged in extremist activities out of a force of 2 million. It appears investigators were looking in the wrong place. The search for extremists might have yielded better results had they examined the Department of Defense Education Activity (DODEA), the government agency that administers K-12 education to the children of military personnel.

The Claremont Institute’s recently released report “Grooming Future Revolutionaries” describes shocking indoctrination taking place at overseas schools. It is a must-read, especially for military parents of the nearly 70,000 children in these schools.

I am a military spouse and the mother of a former DODEA student. The particular teacher training that was the focus of Claremont’s report is the reason, in part, why I lost all trust in the system.

In May 2021, I saw that DODEA would be holding an “Equity and Access Summit” for teachers and administrators. Knowing that “equity” means different things to different people, I wanted to get a sense of what it meant at DODEA. When I managed to gain access to the recordings, I was absolutely floored by what I saw and heard.

As the Claremont report shows, the summit featured hours of teacher training steeped in critical race and gender identity theories.

Claremont released a video of summit clips in which a principal talks about a student who felt like he’d done something wrong because he’s a “young, white male.” The teacher said she didn’t know what to tell him — but she seemed pleased with the breakthrough. Perhaps she was just following the lead of DODEA’s diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) chief Kelisa Wing, who is currently under investigation by DOD for a history of disparaging comments toward white people.

The report also highlights literature teacher Gregory DeJardin’s presentation called “Combating 1- Sided Narratives (Decolonize the Curriculum).” DeJardin insists teachers become social activists and interviewed several students in his class at Vicenza High School in Italy about their difficulties with “majority culture.” It was painfully apparent in their answers that they were parroting his dogma, as one student said: “[School] is getting better about being more diverse and not taking a very normative perspective but there are definitely issues and I feel like it is still incredibly skewed to the white, male, heterosexual and Protestant gaze.”

Betty Roberts, an educator at Robinson Barracks Elementary School in Germany, talked about critical literacy. She wants her students to look deeply into textbook versions of events to find hidden biases. She asks her students questions like: “Is the American Revolution still being fought today?” She presses further and asks if the American Revolution was just a “transition from one group of rich white men to another group of rich white men.” Roberts goes on to express her gratefulness to the teachers’ union for its training on white fragility because she recognized her need for cultural humility.

Normalizing Transgenderism

Aside from the relentless instruction on anti-racism and white privilege, a clear effort was underway to normalize transgender identities and the notion of a gender spectrum. Genevieve Chavez and Lindsey Bagnaschi, presenters of “Ally 101 — Creating an Inclusive Classroom for LGBTQ+ Students,” talked about gender transitions they have facilitated for students at their schools in Spain and Germany, respectively — sometimes without parental knowledge or consent.

And many LGBT educators apparently belong to a system-wide resource-sharing group on Schoology curated by a DODEA educator. Chavez recommends resources from the group such as “Teaching with Mx. T” and “Teaching Outside the Binary.” But there is another similar group that’s passcode protected — and it’s for students. Teachers can add students to their own LGBT chat rooms in Schoology, and parents are not invited.

If teachers run out of content from people like “Mx. T,” they can use Discovery Education, which many recommended during the summit. One of the programs is “Speak Truth to Power.” This program offers lesson plans that are “flexible, standards-aligned digital resources, designed to educate, engage and inspire the next generation of human rights defenders.” Sounds good, doesn’t it — until you see that transgender activist Jazz Jennings is one of those human rights defenders. But Discovery Education is password-protected, with one portal for students and another for teachers, so we really have no idea what’s being promoted to our children via third-party content creators who can update information in real-time.

Congress Needs to Do More

Our children deserve to learn in an environment free from divisive ideologies, and thankfully, DODEA’s activism has not gone unnoticed by Congress. Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo., wrote a letter to DOD asking why teachers are being trained to secretly “transition” children at overseas schools. After a year, she still had not received an answer. She also introduced H.R. 4764, the No CRT for our Military Kids Act.

In the Senate, Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., offered an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2023 to prevent DODEA schools from hiding important medical information from parents — but it was voted down.

Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., introduced a Servicemember Parents Bill of Rights amendment to the NDAA to provide for more transparency and accountability in DODEA schools. It was adopted in committee with bipartisan support by a vote of 39-19 and is in the House-passed NDAA.

But Congress needs to do much more to ensure the safety of our military children and also that of any DODEA educator who is being intimidated into conformity. It will likely take years to sort out the mess at DODEA, so in the meantime, Congress could consider extending the military’s Non-DOD Schools Program to all students instead of only to those who are not in close proximity to a DODEA school.

Whatever the case, it looks like an extremist stand down is in order for DODEA, and it just might net more than the .005 percent found among our uniformed force.

Conservatives Can't Hide From The Left. They Have To Fight,"One of the comforting fictions conservatives are increasingly tempted to tell themselves is that if they just move to a red state or county, the insanity of the woke left won’t affect them and their family. Ensconced in safely Republican communities, perhaps they’ll be free not just from disastrous Democrat policies but also from the pernicious sexual propaganda of the left. For conservatives with children, this is especially important.

But it’s a mirage. There is no American town or hamlet remote or red enough to prevent the infiltration of leftist ideology, which today often comes from institutions that in an earlier era would have been seen as the guardians of a decidedly Christian civic virtue. Not only are left-wing activists taking over these institutions, but they are also working to ban conservatives, and especially Christians, from the public square altogether.

There is nowhere today that conservatives can run and hide from the left. They can either surrender or stand and fight.

Consider what’s playing out in the small town of Taylor, Texas, population 16,807. Situated about 40 miles northeast of deep-blue Austin, it has long been precisely the sort of place conservative families might move to raise their children — a quiet and peaceful town full of churches in a deep-red part of the Lone Star State.

For decades, Taylor has staged a Christmas — not “holiday” — parade down Main Street. The Taylor Christmas Parade of Lights is a beloved tradition that for the past 10 years or so has been organized under the auspices of the Taylor Area Ministerial Alliance, or TAMA, a coalition of local churches.

Last year, as a result of an oversight in the application process, an LGBT advocacy group called Taylor Pride was included in the parade. The oversight in this case was that the old ladies who volunteer to organize the parade and process float applications had never heard of a group called Taylor Pride and didn’t realize what it was. (And no wonder, before the summer of 2021 the group had never staged a public event.)

By the time parade organizers found out, it was too late. Two men dressed in drag, one as a female Santa and the other scantily clad in glitter, were suggestively gyrating to dance music on the Taylor Pride float as it rolled down Main Street in the annual Christmas parade — as it happened, right in front of a float for Saint Mary’s Catholic School, which was full of children.

Parents and attendees were understandably outraged. Soon after the parade, TAMA decided that in the future, parade entries must be consistent with traditional biblical and family values, and made an announcement to that effect ahead of this year’s parade. The point, as TAMA’s statement made clear, was not to exclude any individuals or groups from attending or even participating in the parade, but to ensure the floats were family-friendly and not contrary to Christian teachings.

In response, the Taylor City Council announced it would stage a separate, city-sponsored parade, calling it the “Very Merry Holiday Parade and Celebration” — on the same night as the traditional TAMA parade, following immediately behind it on the same route, for the express purpose of giving Taylor Pride and other LGBT groups a parade of their own. As a recent post on the City of Taylor’s official Facebook page explained, the city is doing this because “we are committed to being inclusive and diverse in the City of Taylor.”

A spokesman for the city has since falsely characterized the situation to at least one local news outlet, saying TAMA had “made it clear that they did not want certain people to be a part of the parade,” and, “They were going to go in a little bit of a different direction … and make it a little bit more exclusive.”

This is exactly the opposite of what’s happened. The only thing that’s changed is that TAMA has realized that LGBT groups like Taylor Pride have targeted their town and attempted, with some success, to infiltrate and undermine their traditional civic celebrations of Christmas. So they decided to push back and insist on the survival of their traditions. Good for them.

The point here is that Taylor might as well be every conservative community in America. It’s located in Texas’s 31st Congressional District, one of two congressional districts in Texas that have never been represented by a Democrat. Voters there just reelected Republican Rep. John Carter for the 11th time. He ran unopposed. Taylor also sits in Williamson County, where nearly every elected office is held by a Republican.

Indeed, Taylor is the last place in the country where a family attending a Christmas parade organized by a coalition of local churches would expect to see two men in drag dancing inappropriately on a float rolling down Main Street. Yet like many such towns across the country, the city council and municipal staff are eager to prove just how enlightened and woke they are. Send in the drag queen holiday floats.

By now, Christians in Taylor must surely know that next year, there will be only one parade down Main Street in December — and it won’t be the Taylor Christmas Parade of Lights. Unless they vote the city council out of office and clean house in City Hall, traditions like the Christmas parade will soon be a thing of the past there, another lost battle in a never-ending war of attrition waged by the left. Same goes for the public library and the public schools. If conservatives don’t take them over, the left will.

It might just be one small town in Texas, but Taylor stands as a cautionary tale. It isn’t enough to move to a red state or a Republican district. You are going to have to fight the left, and win, or surrender to them. There is nowhere left to hide.

Pope Francis's Support Of Gay Marriage Undermines Key Doctrine,"When Belgium’s Catholic bishops meet him for their required visit on Nov. 21-26, Pope Francis will have the chance to either reaffirm or negate Catholic doctrine concerning one of civilization’s most contentious issues: same-sex marriage.

Flemish bishops in September published a proposed liturgy for same-sex couples. Belgium’s French-speaking bishops said afterward they would consider something similar.

But such liturgies could lead to sacramental recognition of same-sex marriage. That would mark a pivotal, perhaps irrevocable, theological and moral shift, especially when secular authorities increasingly support exposing children to LGBT sexuality.

For centuries, the Catholic Church taught that same-sex marriage was sacramentally invalid. The catechism defines homosexual sex as “acts of grave depravity” and “intrinsically disordered” and urges homosexuals to practice chastity.

The catechism reflects biblical teaching. Leviticus included homosexuality alongside other sexual behaviors considered “detestable.” In the New Testament, Jesus defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman. St. Paul, a former Pharisee, described homosexual acts as “shameful” and practicing homosexuals as unable to “inherit the Kingdom of God.”

In March 2021, responding to a similar challenge from Germany’s bishops, the Vatican’s leading theological body, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, declared that the church had no authority to bless same-sex unions. The congregation’s written response pointedly mentioned that Francis himself approved the decision and its publication.

Years before that decision, Francis reiterated Catholic teaching on marriage. He even described gender theory as “ideological colonization.” But the Belgian bishops cited Francis as their inspiration.

Quoting from Francis’ “Amoris Laetitia,” which addresses family love, the bishops expressed their goal to use the “discernment, guidance and integration” he advocates to “give a concrete response and fulfillment to the desire to give explicit attention to the situation of homosexual persons, their parents, and families in their policy making.” The bishops concluded with a proposed “prayer for love and loyalty.”

Though Francis defends traditional marriage in words, his actions reveal an apathetic tolerance for LGBT advocacy and behavior. That apathy extends to his appointments.

One is Cardinal Vincenzo Paglia, who, as I noted in these pages in September, has a concerning tolerance for abortion. Francis named him in 2016 to be president of the Pontifical Academy for Life, which Pope John Paul II founded to combat abortion. But before moving to the Vatican, Paglia showed a penchant for homosexuality.

While archbishop of a small diocese north of Rome, Paglia commissioned for his cathedral a painting dominated by homoerotic images. It includes a scene showing the semi-nude archbishop, wearing his skullcap, embracing a semi-nude male.

Paglia and another priest supervised every aspect of the work.

“There was no detail that was done freely, at random,” said the artist, Ricardo Cinalli. “Everything was analyzed. Everything was discussed. They never allowed me to work on my own.”

From 2012-2016, Paglia was president of the Pontifical Council for the Family. In that role, he released a sex-education course for teens that Dr. Rick Fitzgibbons called “the most dangerous threat to Catholic youth that I have seen over the past 40 years.”

“As a professional who has treated both priest perpetrators and the victims of the abuse crisis in the Church,” he said, “what I found particularly troubling was that the pornographic images in this program are similar to those used by adult sexual predators of adolescents.”

Another such appointment is the Rev. James Martin. The editor-at-large of the Jesuit magazine “America” became one of Francis’s communications advisers in 2017. Using his various platforms, especially Twitter, Martin positions himself as an LGBT ally, even to the point of contradicting established teaching.

Martin not only posted tweets implying support for the Belgian bishops. In 2019, he admitted on Twitter that the Bible “clearly condemns” homosexual sex. “The issue,” the Jesuit continued, “is precisely whether the biblical judgment is correct.” That statement repudiates the fundamental Catholic doctrine that Scripture is divinely inspired.

In 2017, Martin expressed his opinion emphatically. That August at Villanova University, he told a gay man who refrains from kissing his partner during the Sign of Peace at Mass, “I hope in ten years you will be able to kiss your partner or, you know, soon to be your husband. Why not? What’s the terrible thing?”

Martin has substantial influence in Rome. On Nov. 11, Martin met Francis for two private audiences “during which we spoke about the joys and hopes, the griefs and anxieties, of LGBTQ Catholics,” he tweeted. The time was “indeed punctuated with smiles and laughter, and after which I indeed felt elated,” he added. “It was a warm, inspiring and encouraging meeting that I’ll never forget.”

Another indication of Francis’s apathy is the art designed for an upcoming international synod on church governance. One section, “Exclusion to Inclusion,” disparages “Scripture” and “Catholic identity” as exclusionary but ranks “LGBTQ+ identity” with inclusive terms. Another features a figure wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the word “Pride” in rainbow colors that reads: “We are the young people of the future, and the future is now.”

Damian Thompson, who covers religion for Britain’s Observer, believes Francis uses inaction to indicate approval. Thompson cites such examples as the case of German Bishop Franz-Josef Bode, who refused to resign despite tolerating clerical sex abuse.

“If Bishop Bode is allowed to remain in office despite admitting very serious failures relating to sex abuse, then that’s because Pope Francis is happy for him to do so,” Thompson said on his Sept. 27 podcast. “Why are the bishops of Germany and Belgium proposing fundamental changes to Catholic teaching? Because Francis has invited them to do so. “

Given the contrast between Francis’s rhetoric and behavior, the Catholic Church risks jettisoning centuries of teaching for post-modernist fashion.

Dems Twist Shooting To Smear Parents Against Gender-Bending,"Image Credit KHOU 11/YouTube

The left is working overtime to exploit Saturday’s Club Q Shooting in Colorado Springs, Colorado, to target efforts across the country to protect minors from the excesses of LGBT policies. Despite having very little information about the shooter, 22-year-old Anderson Lee Aldrich, or his motivations in opening fire into the gay club, the narrative has been set by politicians and their media allies: Anti-LGBT rhetoric, conservative policies, and “hate” are to blame.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., blamed the GOP for multiple mass shootings targeting minorities, “And now after an anti-LGBT+ campaign, Colorado Springs. Connect the dots, @GOP.”

Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., demanded, “Every GOP politician spewing anti-LGBTQ rhetoric bears responsibility for the Colorado Springs shooting. Every GOP politician who says that guns aren’t the problem bears responsibility for the Colorado Springs shooting. Enough.”

Other prominent Democrats argued, “Certain politicians structured their entire campaigns on anti-LGBTQ fearmongering,” while others claimed Republicans “hoped it would win them elections.”

Both Politico and The Washington Post noted in their coverage of the shooting that the club had scheduled an “all ages” brunch on the Sunday after the shooting.

Watch how @washingtonpost does this—we have no idea about the motive for the gay nightclub shooting in Colorado Saturday night. But it adds info about an all-ages drag show scheduled the next day to imply that those who oppose drag shows for kids are to blame for these deaths. pic.twitter.com/8IzDU9VLUb — Megan Basham (@megbasham) November 21, 2022

The intention is obvious. The goal is to try to intimidate conservatives and parents from continuing to oppose harmful LGBT policies in education, medicine, and girls’ sports. By shifting the narrative to position all opposition to LGBT policies as “hate” and directly responsible for violence, the left believes it can crush what has been a successful campaign nationwide.

As Matt Walsh pointed out, “Leftists are using a mass shooting to try and blackmail us into accepting the castration and sexualization of children. These people are just beyond evil. I have never felt more motivated to oppose everything they stand for, with every fiber of my being. Despicable scumbags.”

Hateful and violent online rhetoric targeting LGBTQ people has been ratcheting up for months. Now, just hours after a deadly mass shooting at #ClubQ, the worst of these hate accounts, LibsofTikTok is targeting another drag event in Colorado.

The left has spent months targeting the popular Libs of TikTok Twitter account for reposting publicly available media created and shared by LGBT activists themselves, often teachers. Claiming this is dangerous, Twitter has suspended the account multiple times, most recently in September. Around the same time, the account was blamed for a woman calling in a fake bomb threat to Boston Children’s Hospital after Libs of TikTok shared a video from the hospital promoting “gender-affirming hysterectomies.” The hospital sees patients up to age 21 and received criticism for the policy.

Drag performances are about joy and community. And they have been the target of extremists this last year. This weekend’s tragedy is the horrifying reality that LGBTQ+ people are living in.



We must protect these spaces and all LGBTQ+ people. https://t.co/2ioIc1VrF6 — Human Rights Campaign (@HRC) November 21, 2022

Parents have become vocal at school board meetings opposing sexually explicit LGBT-themed books and curricula in schools. States such as Tennessee have introduced legislation to ban dangerous and often irreversible medical interventions for minors and parents. Religious leaders and conservatives have protested drag shows for kids all across the country. These efforts have been falsely labeled “anti-LGBT” by the left and erroneously conflated reasonable protections for children with attacks on LGBT people. This effort is currently ramping up at a terrifying speed, fueled by the outrage over this most recent shooting, despite no solid evidence any of it is relevant whatsoever.

It is more important than ever to stand up for and support brave voices, especially parents, working tirelessly to expose abuses of power and exploitation of children. Regardless of how intense the fire of left-wing outrage becomes, the work must go on and legislative efforts must be lifted up higher than ever. Regardless of what motivated this particular person in taking the lives of innocent people, we cannot allow the left to use the incident as a weapon against our work to protect children and girls.

Despite hysterical claims, there is no specific or escalating threat to LGBT Americans, and there is nothing to support the argument that conservative and parental efforts to influence policies and laws affecting their families and children are harming LGBT people or putting them in danger. The fight for parental rights, responsible medicine, and common-sense child safety policies regarding adult entertainment is necessary and important. We cannot allow ourselves to be bullied into silence.

Disney Needs To Get Rid Of More Than Its CEO,"After actively antagonizing parents and conservatives, Disney is scrambling to recover the public’s goodwill by canning CEO Bob Chapek and welcoming back former CEO Bob Iger. The surprise move to reinstate 71-year-old Iger after two years of Chapek’s reign follows a flailing quarterly earnings report. But Disney will have to chuck more than its chief executive into the reject pile to regain the trust of parents put off by the company’s targeting of children with its sexual agenda.

Earlier this month, Disney posted profit and revenue that came in below projections for its fourth fiscal quarter, causing shares to hit a new 52-week low. While the company tried to emphasize growth on its streaming platform, Disney Plus, CNBC noted that “Disney’s streaming services lost $1.47 billion last quarter, more than double the unit’s loss from a year prior.” Later that week, a memo from Chapek revealed plans for a hiring freeze and layoffs. Disney stock is down 40 percent this year alone and shrank by nearly a third under Chapek.

Why might Disney be struggling? Maybe it’s because the supposedly “family-friendly” entertainment behemoth has steadily been feeding a left-wing sexual agenda to children — and bragging about it.

In March, Disney fought against a Florida law barring classroom instruction about sexual ideology in kindergarten through third grade, after the CEO was chastened by LGBT extremists for not speaking up soon or strongly enough. Chapek led the company in vowing to get rid of the law, which even a majority of Democrat voters supported.

Around the same time, in discussions obtained by investigative journalist Chris Rufo, Disney employees were caught openly bragging about filling children’s movies with sexual propaganda.

“Our leadership over there has been so welcoming to my, like, not-at-all-secret gay agenda,” boasted Latoya Raveneau, an executive producer for Disney Television Animation. “I was just, wherever I could, just basically adding queerness. … No one would stop me and no one was trying to stop me.”

Another Disney employee advertised a “tracker” he uses to meet self-imposed quotas for LGBT characters in Disney’s “Moon Girl” TV series. President of Disney General Entertainment Karey Burke reportedly signaled a goal that at least 50 percent of Disney characters will be LGBT or racial minorities by the year’s end.

After those leaks, a Trafalgar Group/Convention of States Action poll found that 68 percent of Americans said they were “less likely” to do business with Disney as a result.

[READ NEXT: Disney Executives Admit: Of Course We’re Grooming Your Children]

That pervasive agenda has been evident from movies like “Lightyear” to shows like “Baymax.” Last year, Walt Disney World also ditched the phrase “ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls” from its iconic fireworks show for not being “inclusive” enough. Speaking of “inclusion,” Disney segregated employees into “affinity groups” based on their race, as Rufo reported last year.

Disney waded further into politics when, after the Supreme Court released its Dobbs decision, it offered to pay for female employees to go out of state to kill their unborn children while Disney subsidiary Hulu cut maternity leave.

And all of that is on top of Disney’s sustained kowtowing to the Chinese Communist Party. In its live-action “Mulan” in 2020, the company straight-up thanked the propaganda department of the Chinese region where Muslim Uighurs are being forced into deadly “reeducation” camps. Much of Disney’s coziness with the communist regime in China happened under Iger’s direction. In 2019, Iger refused to condemn the CCP’s crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, and Disney has repeatedly bent the knee to Chinese censors in its filmmaking.

Disney has been headed toward its current problematic position for years. Swapping Chapek for Iger isn’t enough to reverse course. Iger was the one who said, in a video summarized by Rufo, that “the company ‘should be taking a stand’ on political controversies and will no longer ‘shy away from politics’ in the future.” Iger has also spoken up about former President Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accords, illegal immigration, and a Georgia law limiting abortion, as my colleague Emily Jashinsky pointed out. And that was all the way back in 2019.

Iger actually blasted Florida’s “Parental Rights in Education” law before Chapek did! And, as Vogue noted in a 2018 feature on Iger, under Iger’s leadership, “Disney had sent a warning to Georgia’s governor, Nathan Deal, that it would no longer do business in the state” if he signed a law protecting the religious freedom of business owners to refuse to provide services that violate their consciences. The only reason Iger didn’t spur a fight then like Chapek’s with DeSantis is that Deal gutlessly caved to pressure from groups like Disney and vetoed the bill.

If Disney wants to reverse its decline into a child-grooming, genocide-tolerating propaganda machine, the company will need to ditch more than Bob Chapek. Bob Iger hasn’t signaled that he’ll appease Chinese communists or sexually confused activists any less than his successor-turned-predecessor, even though corporate media are doing their best to use Chapek as a whipping boy for Disney’s blunders so the wokeness can continue unencumbered under Iger.

Just swapping desk nameplates in the Disney executive suite isn’t enough. Disney should fire the employees who are openly bragging about sexualizing children’s movies, listen to parents’ concerns and act on them, get out of bed with the CCP, and start making movies that are designed to innocently entertain instead of propagandize. Iger’s reputation might salvage Disney’s bottom line for the time being, but without a much deeper clean, the Mouse infestation is only going to get worse.

Biden's Silence On Idaho Student Murders Speaks Volumes,"Two deadly tragedies are capturing national attention this week. Last Saturday, a man shot and killed five people and injured at least 25 at Club Q, a Colorado LGBT nightclub. One week before, four University of Idaho students were brutally stabbed to death by a still unknown murderer. Both killings were grotesque, traumatized their respective communities, and have garnered national headlines and mourning. Only one of these mass killings, however, was addressed by President Joe Biden.

“While no motive in this attack is yet clear, we know that the LGBTQI+ community has been subjected to horrific hate violence in recent years,” Biden said in a statement about last Saturday’s nightclub shooting. “We must drive out the inequities that contribute to violence against LGBTQI+ people. We cannot and must not tolerate hate.”

We now know that Biden and other Democrats jumped the gun by suggesting the shooting was the result of LGBT “hate.” On Tuesday, it was reported that the 22-year-old alleged nightclub shooter identifies as “non-binary” and uses the plural “they” and “them” pronouns, making him part of the LGBT coalition himself.

The president also used the shooting to promote his anti-Second Amendment agenda. “We must address the public health epidemic of gun violence in all of its forms,” Biden said. “Earlier this year, I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly three decades, in addition to taking other historic actions. But we must do more. We need to enact an assault weapons ban to get weapons of war off America’s streets.”

Perhaps Biden is ignoring the tragic deaths of four young college kids in Idaho because their murders did not involve a gun. Madison Mogen, 21, Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Xana Kernodle, 20, and Xana’s boyfriend, Ethan Chapin, 20, were brutally stabbed to death with what police are calling a Rambo-like knife.

The killings took place sometime after 3 a.m. while the students were sleeping in a home near the university campus. Mysteriously, two roommates and a dog who also lived in the house were spared by the killer. The murderer is still at large, and local authorities have not yet named a suspect, which is terrifying the local community.

The students are so disturbed by what happened that many left campus early for Thanksgiving break. The president of the university even announced that students and professors have the option to use remote learning for the remainder of the fall semester.

Since their deaths, heartbreaking old photos and TikTok videos have emerged of the young friends enjoying life and the college experience. The victims of this crime don’t check off any intersectional boxes. They were white college kids living in a flyover state. Their cause of death won’t help congressional Democrats push gun laws or score points with minorities or LGBT Americans. Publicly speaking about these murders and showing compassion for the victims and their families also won’t give them the benefit of blaming Republicans for somehow “inciting” violence.

The truth is, tragedy can and will strike no matter how many gun laws are passed. Chicago has some of the strictest gun laws in the country. Yet every week countless, mostly black residents, are shot and killed. Just this morning a teen was murdered in the Windy City. Chicago is a leftist utopia, complete with a radical mayor, tough gun laws, and an attorney general who refuses to prosecute violent criminals, including murderers, in the name of equity, so the president and corporate media have no comment for the bloody streets of Chicago. It’s not politically advantageous.

If guns are illegal, a criminal will still find a way to get one, just as they do in Chicago, and those who can’t use a gun will use a knife or a car. There is evil in our fallen world, and there always will be. Placing a tragedy on the shoulders of a political opponent is ugly.

It is also gross for the president of the United States to make statements only about national tragedies that are politically useful to him. “I promise you this,” wrote Biden before taking office, “I will be a President for all Americans.”

If Biden were sincere, he would acknowledge the killings that occur every day in Chicago, and he would treat the deaths of the four young Idaho college students with the same compassion and urgency that he afforded those who died at Club Q in Colorado.

Voters Oppose Gay Marriage Bill Their 12 GOP Senators Advanced,"Image Credit Nathan Cowley/Pexels/Cropped

Constituents of the 12 Republican senators who voted to advance Democrats’ wrongly named Respect for Marriage Act strongly oppose the legislation because they know it poses a risk to the First Amendment rights of religious Americans, a new poll from the Heritage Foundation found.

Different polling in October claimed that voters in “key battleground” states including Alaska, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, North Carolina, Utah, Wisconsin, West Virginia, and Wyoming were more likely to vote for senators who pledged to vote for the legislation.

Heritage’s November poll, however, found that 47 percent, a plurality, of voters represented by Sens. Todd Young of Indiana, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Mitt Romney of Utah, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming strongly oppose the legislation.

Under this bill, religious organizations and business owners who do not submit to the government’s attempts to dictate Americans’ theology will be subject to legal scrutiny, endless lawsuits, and fines. Young, Ernst, Romney, Moore Capito, Lummis, and their seven other Republican colleagues who voted for the objectionable legislation were warned of its problems by legal scholars, legislators, and religious liberty groups including Ryan T. Anderson, Roger Severino, Rep. Chip Roy, Sen. Mike Lee, Alliance Defending Freedom, and Liberty Counsel. Regardless of those warnings, the GOP senators voted to proceed.

That decision specifically doesn’t sit well with the 70 percent of GOP voters and 73 percent of the conservative constituents in those states who say they object to the bill, which would embolden LGBT activists who regularly exploit the legal system to target religious Americans such as Colorado cake artist Jack Phillips, Washington florist Barronelle Stutzman, and Colorado graphic designer Lorie Smith.

Opposition to the so-called Respect for Marriage Act, Heritage reported, “only solidified” after pollsters informed voters that it would unleash a barrage of lawsuits against religious Americans who refuse to perform or participate in same-sex weddings or affirm those marriages.

“In fact, for every message tested in this survey, a majority of respondents said they were less likely to support the bill given the information,” Heritage reported.

When voters learned that religious organizations and for-profit businesses that are owned and operated by people with traditional beliefs about marriage would come under fire for those beliefs, dissent for the bill rose to 53 percent among all voters.

Similarly, when respondents were informed that this bill would make religious adoption agencies susceptible to losing their nonprofit status, opposition to the legislation measured at 52 percent.

Approximately 51 percent of respondents, 70 percent of Republicans, said they were unlikely to support the legislation after they learned it “could weaponize the IRS against faith-based organizations, including religious schools, by threatening their nonprofit status for not recognizing same-sex marriage.”

The poll never directly asked whether the government should be able to tell religious nonprofits or other businesses what to believe but still yielded majority opposition generally and huge majority opposition from the constituents of several of the supportive GOP senators.

Only three of the supportive Republican senators will need to change their minds and align with their constituents during the final legislation vote next week to reject this bill.

"When Christians Capitulate On Marriage, Children Suffer","Learning this month that 12 Senate Republicans had signed on with Democrats to advance the misnamed Respect for Marriage Act left many Christians stunned. Most shocking was the “yes” vote from Roy Blunt, a practicing Southern Baptist who served for three years as president of a small, private university in the theologically conservative denomination.

How, many wondered, could a political leader with such deep roots in one of the most traditional branches of evangelicalism so publicly undermine the foremost human institution created by God? Those asking must not have been paying attention to the shift that has taken place in elite evangelical circles in recent years.

Christianity Today’s Initial Concession

One of the earliest signs that the commitment to defend biblical marriage was weakening came from Christianity Today CEO Timothy Dalrymple. In 2012, seven years before he took the helm of the publication founded by Billy Graham, he went on record arguing that it might be “time to stop opposing same-sex marriage as a matter of law.”

Dalrymple assured his readers that he’s among those who believe “it’s biblically and theologically clear that marriage was created and ordained by God for the union of male and female.” But he also encouraged them to “humbly acknowledge the limitations of our knowledge, and recognize the possibility that we are mistaken.”

Calling marriage an issue of “secondary importance,” he went on to say that Christians need to ask themselves “whether it is still wise to press for American law to recognize only heterosexual unions.” He worried that continuing to insist on marriage as founded by God would “harm our witness” and suggested the church’s credibility might be better spent on more important issues.

Note, Dalrymple was suggesting believers should capitulate on the issue of marriage three years before the Supreme Court discovered that gay partners have a constitutional right to have the government’s blessing on their affection (though, interestingly, only months after former President Barack Obama announced he had evolved on the question of whether the state should legalize gay marriage).

A key factor, Dalrymple said, is that homosexual unions don’t have clear victims, as abortion does. He closed the essay by intimating that he was still working out his views on whether it is worth continuing to argue for the biblical definition of marriage.

By February 2019, three months before he officially ascended to the top position at Christianity Today, there were signs he had settled those views. It was then that Dalrymple traveled to Mexico to attend the wedding ceremony of a gay co-worker officiated by prominent LGBT-affirming pastor and author Jonathan Merritt.

The pictures posted on a public website are festive, even reverent, showing Dalrymple and his wife participating in a candle-lighting processional and hitting the dance floor with abandon in honor of the two men. It seems worth reiterating that the wedding involved not a relative, but a co-worker. Thus, Dalrymple was presumably under no familial pressure to attend. The wedding was also in another country, providing a fairly obvious excuse to decline if he wanted to avoid hurt feelings. Yet still, he went.

Celebrating Sin

As the question of attending same-sex wedding ceremonies and celebrations has become more pressing, many theologians have said that Christians actually discredit the faith by agreeing to participate.

Dr. Albert Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, has written that Christians cannot celebrate what they know to be sin. “At some point, attendance will involve congratulating the couple for their union,” he said. “If you can’t congratulate the couple, how can you attend?”

Pastor and author John Piper has addressed the issue in likeminded terms. “To celebrate this lifestyle is to celebrate the destruction of human beings, and that is hateful,” he said. “It would be like saying, ‘Let’s all have a meeting and celebrate greed. Let’s all have a meeting and celebrate adultery.’ Anybody that joins in celebrating sin is sinning.”

What’s the relevance of Dalrymple’s decision to celebrate a gay union three years ago and write about abandoning the legal fight for traditional marriage 10 years ago? It is how his outlook may be influencing the framing of the Respect for Marriage Act in evangelicalism’s flagship publication today.

The only essay Christianity Today has published regarding the bill has been in favor of it as a necessary concession in a pluralistic nation. “All in all, RMA is a modest but good day’s work. It shows that religious liberty champions and LGBT advocates can work together for the common good,” writes law professor Carl H. Esbeck. (I reached out to Christianity Today to ask about Dalrymple’s views and his decision to participate in his co-worker’s same-sex wedding and did not receive a response.)

Like Dalrymple’s 2012 article, Esbeck spares little thought to how subsequent generations may be affected by this “good day’s work.”

Nor does the President of the National Association of Evangelicals, Pastor Walter Kim.

According to Deseret News, in 2021 Kim participated in a virtual summit focused on persuading “Congress to pass a law protecting LGBTQ Americans from discrimination.” Deseret reports that Kim argued that a “winner-take-all attitude” among Christians regarding marriage “should be concerning.” Instead of promoting policies that align with God’s order, Kim warned that “Christians are called not to win culture wars, but to defend the dignity of all human beings.”

This explains why Kim wrote a letter to Sens. Tammy Baldwin, D-WI, and Susan Collins, R-ME, thanking them for their efforts to get the Respect for Marriage Act past the filibuster hurdle.

“Your efforts, if successful, will produce the first significant bipartisan legislation in many years advancing religious freedom for all,” Kim writes, despite the fact that numerous conservative groups like The Heritage Foundation and Alliance Defending Freedom have said the RMA will put targets on the backs of religious organizations and open up people of faith to a barrage of lawsuits.

But perhaps no one has done more to further the idea that Christians should not let the God they worship influence their policy views than one-time defender of traditional marriage, David French.

The French Evolution on Marriage

As a political pundit, French has been singularly influential in evangelical establishment circles, referenced regularly not only in Christianity Today’s pages and podcasts but also giving speeches at Southern Baptist seminaries and winning praise from outlets such as The Gospel Coalition as “one of the few Christians who is able to bring gospel-centered arguments into the public square.”

In all three of his essays on RMA in the last week, French reveals that he, too, has evolved on marriage and, like Dalrymple, discourages Christians from resisting the enshrinement of gay marriage into U.S. law.

French’s religious view of matrimony as a covenant between a man and a woman has not changed, he says, but he adds, “Religious belief is not the same thing as declaring civil law … I don’t want the law to discriminate against those Americans who sincerely hold different views of sexual morality, sexuality, and marriage and organize their lives and their institutions accordingly.”

In other words, he makes the same argument about marriage that Catholics Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi have about abortion — he has personal views based on his faith but does not want those views, however endorsed they may be by the Creator of the universe, to be reflected in U.S. statute.

He likewise gives no hint that he recognizes any societal harm that might flow from subverting traditional marriage. In defiance of the onslaught of rainbow-hued indoctrination that parents suddenly find being targeted at their children in schools, libraries, and popular entertainment, he falls back on the embarrassing canard, “The gay couple down the street in no way makes our own straight marriage more difficult or challenging.”

In fact, French reveals that while he felt the Obergefell ruling did not do enough to protect religious liberty, he believes its argument for ushering in an entirely new form of marriage, unknown to previous ages, was well-founded. He writes that as far back as 2004, he believed, “In a diverse, pluralistic republic, granting the same rights to others that we’d like to exercise ourselves should be the default posture of public advocacy and public policy.”

Now that the fundamental transformation of marriage has taken place, French argues it should be permanent: “It would be profoundly disruptive and unjust to rip out the legal superstructure around which they’ve ordered their lives,” he writes.

Leaving aside how this same argument could have been applied to Dred Scott, it’s interesting that French repeatedly references “LGBT families” in his essays (a phrase that naturally brings up sympathetic associations) without specifically treating the question of how children come to be a part of these sterile couplings or how they fare once they are present. In fact, the only passing allusion he makes to children in these households is positive, as when he says, “Millions of Americans are living stable, joyful lives in LGBT families.”

It has been said many times (but it cannot be said enough apparently) that the law’s compelling interest in acknowledging marriage at all is not to sanction romantic attachment between various individuals. It is to recognize the sexually reproductive union of men and women in order to foster the arrangement that best cultivates individual flourishing, which, in turn, creates a flourishing society.

As Mohler commented to me, “A Biblical understanding of harm does not limit itself to proximate harm. That means a Christian understanding of harm extends to the entire society. It’s very interesting that you have all the pathologies that have erupted not, first of all, because of same-sex marriage, but because of the decline of marriage itself. Further unraveling of marriage can only result in further pathologies.”

Or even better, as a friend told me privately, “Reconceiving marriage as an institution whose sole purpose is to legitimate the private erotic partnership of adults is a civilizational step backwards toward concubinage.”

Indeed.

Subverting Traditional Marriage is Not a Victimless Crime

What French never acknowledges and Dalrymple barely considers is what happens after weddings. But that is when the harm becomes most evident.

“Three years of planning, saving, and praying have all led to this!” Dalrymple’s friend and his same-sex spouse proclaimed alongside a gauzy photo of them holding up that familiar black-and-white Rorschach strip. An ultrasound. “We can’t wait to be dads and are so thankful for the many amazing women, doctors, and friends — including our surrogate and her family, our agency team, donor … who have been there for us throughout this journey.”

Based on the date the website announced — on or before April 2022 — the baby has already arrived, almost three years to the month that Dalrymple celebrated the union. A child fertilized through a donor egg, bought from an agency, and gestated by a surrogate womb. A child conceived, by design, to live in a household missing one of its biological parents. A child who will, by design, not be raised by its mother, not experience the daily presence of maternal love. A child who will, by design, not benefit from the complementary nurturing of a male and female parent, committed to its wellbeing through the bonds of marriage and natural heritage.

There is no need to rehearse the litany of evidence that children raised apart from their married, biological mothers and fathers fare worse on all manner of social, educational, and developmental outcomes. But it might be necessary to start speaking forthrightly about the more specific emerging evidence that children conceived via donorship suffer from “profound struggles with their origins and identities” and that those raised in same-sex households are more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and sexual abuse.

French never mentions these children. Nor does Dalrymple. Nor does the Christianity Today essay. Nor has Sen. Blunt. Yet this is the dystopian, domino effect of redefining marriage so that Christians may assure themselves they are pluralists in good standing, on the right side of rapidly devolving modern history.

Does the rest of the American church still care about these little children? Or are we too busy protecting our “witness”?

House Dems Kill Amendment Protecting Religious Americans,"Image Credit Anderson Santo/Pexels

Democrats in the House of Representatives blocked an amendment that would have protected religious Americans from retaliation based on their opposition to same-sex marriage, in order to jam legislation furthering the LGBT lobby’s agenda through Congress’s lame-duck session.

House Rules Committee Chairman Rep. James McGovern shot down Republicans’ last chance of defending religious liberty in the ill-named Respect for Marriage Act on Monday when he refused to even let Rep. Chip Roy’s amendment solidifying First Amendment protections be brought to the House floor for a vote.

McGovern’s reasoning for bypassing procedural debate was rooted in the fact that Roy’s amendment would give the process of passing the RFMA a shelf life that could last well into the newly-elected Republican House.

Seeing as most of the Republicans in the current House oppose the RFMA on the grounds that it stomps on religious Americans’ right to act on their convictions about traditional marriage, McGovern and his Democrat allies weren’t keen on waiting around to see if the legislation would survive the new GOP-led House.

“If we were to amend this and it goes back to the Senate, for all intents and purposes, it’s dead for the year. And many of us believe that we have a court right now that is hell-bent on trying to reverse the rights for the LGBTQ community and we do not trust them to respect marriage equality in this country,” McGovern said to the rules committee on Monday. “When January comes along, the gentleman’s party will be in charge and you can bring one amendment after another to reverse the last 70 years of social progress, if the gentleman prefers. We will oppose you on that.”

“There’s no evidence of the armageddon that he describes being at the doorstep,” Republican Rep. Michael Burgess retorted.

Roy, along with his Republican cosponsors Reps. Byron Donalds and Doug Lamborn, submitted the amendment for review on Thursday in a last-ditch effort to convince conservative legislators to prioritize Americans’ First Amendment rights. Roy’s amendment copied the legal protections for religious Americans that Republican Sen. Mike Lee tried, but ultimately failed, to add to the Senate’s version of the legislation two weeks ago.

“I think it would be an important amendment just to offer on the floor of the House,” Roy replied to McGovern during the committee meeting. “You know how it will work. We’ll get an hour of debate on both sides. The amendment will almost certainly get voted down, but I hope it wouldn’t because I believe it’s important. I’d like to have at least the opportunity, in the one hour of debate that I would get in this august body, to be able to make the case for religious liberty with my colleagues.”

McGovern, however, refused to listen to Roy’s concerns. As a result, the unamended RFMA, which expands the Supreme Court’s Obergefell v. Hodges decision to further open the door for LGBT activists to sue Americans opposed to same-sex marriage, will see a floor vote as soon as next week.

The 47 Republican legislators who voted for a previous version of the bill still have a chance to vote no to the RFMA. Even without GOP support, however, the Democrat voting bloc is expected to send the bill to the White House where President Joe Biden already signaled he plans to sign it into law.

Why Do A Few Public Library Radicals Get To Call All The Shots?,"Conservative Christian author, Kirk Cameron, has been rejected by roughly 50 public libraries on the basis of his religious beliefs, according to information released by his publisher, Brave Books. The Rochambeau Public Library in Providence, Rhode Island, for instance, openly dismissed Cameron’s request to share his new children’s book, “As You Grow,” saying, “We are a very queer-friendly library. Our messaging does not align.” The City Heights/Weingart Branch Library in San Diego, California, noted, “Because of how diverse our community is, I don’t know how many people you would get.”

Others simply rejected the request saying the program just wasn’t something they were interested in. Indianapolis Public Library, for example, argued they had a strategic plan in place for their book reading events noting they are “really looking at authors who are diverse. Authors of color. That’s really been our focus.” They continued stating they are focusing on racial equity after Cameron’s publisher pointed out the Christian-themed book is itself diverse.

Cameron responded to the rejections by saying, “Publicly funded libraries are green-lighting ‘gender marker and name change clinics’ while denying a story time that would involve the reading of a book that teaches biblical wisdom. How much more clear can it get?” He is, of course, correct. The rejections received were extremely transparent as the issuers personally objected to the perceived message of Cameron’s book and said no.

The immediate reaction from many conservatives, naturally, is to recognize the stark contrast between LGBT-themed events at public libraries and the difficulty Cameron is having sharing his children’s title. The San Diego library, for example, hosts many LGBT-themed events and organizes with LGBT organizations, including hosting a ‘queer’ book club. On its website, it states, “Telling our stories, highlighting the rich diversity … Those themes that are so important of love, acceptance and inclusion and seeing yourself represented in the books that are reading.” It is obvious those in charge of these libraries have an agenda.

Yet, is it fair to compare the two situations, arguing that if drag queen story hours are a problem in a publicly funded library, so are religious-themed events? The difference is in who is making the decision. For example, Republican Missouri state Rep. Ben Baker introduced the Parental Oversight of Public Libraries Act, HB 2044, designed to empower parental decision-making in the community toward public events. A Rasmussen report in November 2022 found that 60 percent of American adults find “drag queen story hour” inappropriate for children.

There is a clear difference between members of the community (who financially support public libraries with their tax dollars) objecting to certain events being hosted by the library and the personal agenda of the individuals who manage the library dictating how the institution is run. Kirk Cameron cannot host an event because a select few running the library’s day-to-day operations do not want his message to be heard. This is especially true in progressive-dominant areas where the distinction between professionals and activists is impossible to determine and they feel entitled to discriminate.

When the explicitly pornographic book, “Gender Queer,” was exposed as being obviously inappropriate for students in public schools, Republicans were accused of “banning” books. Citing concerns over community rejection of certain titles in public schools and libraries, Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the Office for Intellectual Freedom at the American Library Association, noted, “The primary target still is school libraries and school librarians, K-12 teachers, but we are seeing this bleed over to public libraries.”

CNN argued, “to a wide array of civil rights, civil liberties and free expression groups, these restrictions represent an effort to enshrine the values of one particular group of parents — conservative Whites — over the priorities and experiences of an increasingly diverse society.” Vera Eidelman, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, warned, “There is an overarching trend here of interference with the right to learn and the right to access information.”

Yet, the moment that information is perceived to be in opposition to the progressive message, these leaders of free speech are simply “not interested.”

The American Library Association advocates on its website for public libraries to serve “LGBTQIA+” communities more explicitly, arguing:

Gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender peoples’ access to libraries may be limited or prohibited by many issues, including:

• Collections which do not present LGBTQIA+ content or perspectives. • LGBTQIA+ materials can often be censored under partisan or doctrinal disapproval • Environments which are not welcoming or inclusive of LGBTQIA+ people and which, through actions by staff or other patrons, may be made unwelcome to LGBTQIA+ people and their families • Programs which do not address the LGBTQIA+ experience • Services which are not promoted to LGBTQIA+ populations or in collaborations with local LGBTQIA+ organizations

The left believes they have a moral duty to advocate for certain communities and certain ideologies, which inevitably requires suppression or rejection of content perceived to be in opposition to said communities and ideologies. The mere presence of a conservative Christian perspective is sufficient to warrant concern. The bigotry and prejudice expressed by these leftists simply will not allow them to tolerate even the appearance of being open to such views.

Speaking Out Against Trans Surgeries For Kids Is Not 'Violence',"The Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT advocacy organization, has targeted conservative commentator Matt Walsh of The Daily Wire; the person who runs the Libs of TikTok Twitter account; and Seth Dillon, CEO of the satire site The Babylon Bee, accusing them of causing violence in a new report titled “Online Harassment, Offline Violence.”

The report argues, “Anti-equality, online extremists are leading a proactive and coordinated campaign of hate against hospitals and medical providers who offer gender-affirming care for transgender, non-binary and questioning youth.”

The report states it consists of “an informal exploration across Facebook and Twitter” that identifies “24 different hospitals and providers, across 21 states, who were directly attacked online following harassing, inflammatory and misleading posts from Libs of TikTok, Matt Walsh, and other right-wing accounts.”

Relying on misleading allegations of “lies” and “misinformation,” the report draws a line of causation from Libs of TikTok posting a video from a particular hospital detailing its own practices to inevitable online outrage resulting in angry tweets, emails, and phone calls from individuals, causing the hospital to stop youth-oriented transgender advocacy and/or practices and ultimately resulting in legislative efforts to ban the practices in the first place. The report gives examples of hospitals and doctors receiving hostile or angry communications, threats, and specifically, the false bomb threats against Boston Children’s Hospital.

The report insists, “What occurred in Boston is just one example of coordinated campaigns of hate, violence, and harassment being waged both online and offline against health care providers and children’s hospitals simply for providing age-appropriate, best practice, medically necessary medical care to transgender youth.” However, its claim of offline violence remains abstract and assumed. It provides no examples of actual violence.

Accusations of Hate Speech

Detailing what it argues is a coordinated campaign to target pro-LGBT organizations, the report notes: “hate speech accounts such as Libs of TikTok or Matt Walsh, a known transphobe at the alt-right news site The Daily Wire, post an inflammatory message full of disinformation about gender affirming care and call out a specific hospital or doctor by name.” The alleged campaign continues with “right-wing politicians looking to rile up the most extreme members of their base join in spreading the same transphobic rhetoric from their platforms, in some cases going so far as to introduce legislation to regulate children’s hospitals and gender affirming care providers.”

The final “stage” of these campaigns involves hospitals discontinuing transition practices for minors or legislative efforts that heavily regulate or ban said practices. The report concludes by placing responsibility on social media companies, arguing, “Social media companies have a responsibility to act and to not be bystanders while angry mobs intimidate LGBTQ+ people and our allies into silence.” Continuing, “Without intervention from social media companies, this will just lead to more hate speech, more threats, and more violence.”

Again, without citing any actual examples of violence, the report’s implication is that all negative interactions, from tweets to illegal activity like bomb threats, are essentially equal. The report’s authors then go further by arguing direct causation between the posting of information and the dangerous response. Their conclusion is that authorities must prevent or punish those posting the original information, which allegedly “caused” the violence.

Attempt to Silence Criticism

While obviously any form of violence or threats against an individual or organization is wrong and should be handled by the authorities, the popular left-wing argument that responsibility falls to commentators is absurd — even more so as the targets of their anger quite literally share the information left-wing activists post themselves. What the Human Rights Campaign and other LGBT activists stubbornly refuse to consider is that the outrage and anger are perfectly justifiable. Despite activists’ best efforts, many people reasonably view transgender surgeries on minors as barbaric and destructive.

What these organizations are attempting to do is stigmatize anyone who participates in such criticism by accusing them of contributing to any potential violence that may occur. More to the point, they want to intimidate conservative commentators to prevent them from discussing or sharing provocative LGBT activism, often in their own words, in a way that will result in criticism or outrage. So convinced they are morally justified, they view the natural result of the public viewing this information with outrage and legislative pushback as inherently violent and hateful.

In truth, what we see is the very nature of the democracy they champion in action. A children’s hospital boasts of performing elective double-mastectomies on teenagers as young as 15, as the Boston Children’s Hospital does on its website, and the public is rationally outraged. They express their outrage to the hospital and to their elected representatives, who introduce legislation. The left typically champions public protest and the targeting of organizations with phone calls, tweets, and emails when they disagree with a policy or product decision. Such action only appears to become “violence” and “hate” when the left supports what an organization is doing.

In terms of “causing” things like fake bomb threats or threatening voicemails, the idea that illegal behavior from one individual is the fault of a completely unrelated individual is dangerous and irrational. Libs of TikTok sharing a video produced by a children’s hospital is not a direct link to an unstable person calling in a bomb threat later on. Only the person making the call is responsible. Whatever motivated them to do so is entirely within their control. We simply cannot allow the left to continue bullying critics of their agenda by accusing us of causing violence by doing so.

The LGBT Alphabet Lobby Has Come For Its Own Women,"Imagine saying men can’t be lesbians — and facing prison time for it. One lesbian artist in Norway is in just such a predicament, facing up to three years in prison for saying men cannot become lesbians.

In a Facebook post on Oct. 1, Tonje Gjevjon wrote, “It’s just as impossible for men to become lesbian as it is for men to become pregnant. Men are men regardless of their sexual fetishes.” Her post came in response to Norwegian transgender activist Christine Jentoft, a man who claims to be a lesbian and a mom. On Nov. 17, Gjevjon was notified she was under criminal investigation for hate speech.

Thanks to Norway’s newly-revised (as of 2020) hate speech legislation, which now includes “gender identity or gender expression” in its protected categories, Gjevjon could go to prison for three years over her Facebook post if found guilty.

In another comment directed at Jentoft, Norwegian feminist Christina Ellingsen said men cannot be mothers. Ellingsen is also under police investigation and faces the same potential punishment as Gjevjon.

You’d think laying claim to the letter “L” in LGBT would make one immune to the wrath of the alphabet lobby, but this is not enough. One must subscribe totally to its dogma (particularly where the T’s are concerned) or risk being labeled a TERF, or trans-exclusionary radical feminist, and getting canceled — or possibly thrown in jail.

Therein lies the problem. Women — especially lesbians — cannot expect the LGBT activist crowd (or so-called “allies”) ever to come to their defense. The LGBT movement, much like the sexual revolution, was never really for the liberation or sexual freedom of women. Its logical end has always been about giving power to perversion, rejecting basic biological reality, and trampling the rights of women.

Take University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas, a man who purports to be a woman and competes for Penn’s woman’s swim team. In March, he won the 500-yard freestyle for the NCAA championships, pushing out biological women from their well-earned first and second places and depriving another woman of taking a stand on the podium. Or consider the so-called “gender fluid” male high school student who sexually assaulted a ninth-grade girl in a school bathroom (he was reportedly wearing a skirt) in Loudoun County, Virginia. As a result of the incident, the boy was transferred to another school where he allegedly sexually assaulted another female student.

In the case of both Thomas and the Loudoun County student, women were made to comply with the demands of men or else risk social censure — and look where that coercion and compliance have gotten us. Take the bathroom “debate” in the United States. Many states and hundreds of municipalities allow men to use women’s public bathroom facilities, which has also affected school locker rooms. Men have also been granted access to plenty of other traditional, female-only spaces such as spas, public pools, sports competitions, and even prison facilities. At a Los Angeles spa, a registered sex offender allegedly exposed himself to a group of women, including an underage girl, and a transgender-identifying Rikers inmate raped a female prisoner in the shower earlier this year.

Compliance is not going very well, and it’s hurrying in an abolition of women. Kudos to the brave Norwegian women for breaking from the alphabet pack and taking a stand, even if it costs them.

Media Shamefully Silent Over Atlanta 'Pedophile Ring' Case,"What if you learned a married couple had been arrested for allegations of repeatedly raping their adopted sons and offering them to other nearby pedophiles for the same purpose? Furthermore, these individuals had somehow acquired a lavish suburban mansion despite their modest clerical jobs. It all makes for a shocking and newsworthy story, right?

There’s one other significant part of the story, though: These alleged predators are two gay men and self-described LGBT “activists” with a sizable social media footprint. The media silence around this recent real-life story was sadly predictable.

As of this writing, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN, among others, have not covered the story. It is a deeply disheartening tale from 21st-century America. The nature of the crimes clears the high hurdle for shock in a society where depravity is expected. It also illustrates the identity immunity that seemingly shields certain groups from media scrutiny. While it goes unchecked, this immunity will ruin lives.

For two elementary school-aged brothers, already undergoing a disadvantaged start to life after being left in foster care by heroin-addicted parents, the nightmare began in earnest in Nov. 2018, when William Dale Zulock Jr. and Zachary Jacoby Zulock — the latter of whom had previous child-rape charges mysteriously dropped — adopted them in the Atlanta area. As indicated by court records, horrific sexual abuse began as far back as just one year later and continued until the adoptive parents’ July 2022 arrest.

During that period, the Zulock men allegedly anally and orally raped the boys and performed oral sex on them, often filming these horrendous acts and distributing them to other pedophiles in the Atlanta area, whom they allegedly met on the gay hookup app Grindr. The adoptive parents also allegedly invited some of these contacts to rape the boys. One Snapchat message from Zachary Zulock to one such predator allegedly read, “I’m going to f*** my son tonight. Stand by.” (See Townhall’s recent four-part investigative series for a comprehensive account of the allegations and legal proceedings.)

On the surface, the men cultivated the celebrated lifestyle of a “modern family.” Their Instagram followers, counting among the thousands, consumed curated photography showing everything was normal, even admirable. Gay advocacy magazine Out included the Zulocks in their “No H8” campaign.

At the center of this modern family was a palatial mansion in Loganville, near Atlanta. It is unclear how the civil servant and bank teller afforded to build the home; other houses in the vicinity have market values of around $900,000. Among its ominous features are windowless rooms, one of which is hidden behind a moveable bookcase. “Our business is our business. What happens in our home stays in our home,” the Zulocks allegedly told their abused boys.

While in custody, the Zulock men have exhibited an unfathomable lack of appreciation for the gravity of their situation. They have complained about the manner of the police raid that resulted in their arrest, the seizure of their home, personal finances, and the quality of prison food, among other things.

“We do have, like, subscription stuff that needs canceled like, you know, Disney+, Amazon Video. All that needs to be canceled because it’s auto-hitting our credit card,” explained William. When a relative asked Zachary whether he was worried about the boys, he quickly changed the subject to the house and bills.

“They just view underage boys as sex objects,” said District Attorney Randy McGinley at a virtual court appearance, according to Townhall.

This shocking lack of prioritization might be explainable through the effusive praise these men have enjoyed from society. Their social media activity depicts a life of leisure and comfort. Their experience reflects a societal approach, vigorously driven by our media, to LGBT identity politics that makes no amount of praise sufficient, and any criticism of even deserving individuals harmful to one’s career prospects.

During the Democratic presidential primaries in 2019, CNN produced its “LGBTQ Town Hall” to offer apparently critical insight into candidates’ views on that topic. Initial coverage of the 2019 Jussie Smollett hate-crime hoax and shameless abrupt termination of coverage of last year’s Colorado Springs gay bar shooting — after the public learned the perpetrator claimed so-called nonbinary gender identity — boosted the corporate media’s propagandistic track record.

Sunlight is the best disinfectant, and one way to confront this type of criminal behavior illustrated in the allegations against the Zulocks is media coverage. Predators need to feel unsafe, and ordinary people need to be aware of the warning signs they create.

While corporate media continue to ignore the shocking story, the New York Post and Townhall, to their credit, reported the Zulocks’ arrest in August, without all the grim details that have since come to light. It was Townhall’s extensive report this past week, however, that brought deserved attention to the case. If pressed on the issue, America’s propaganda mouthpieces would trot out the predictable sanctimony about protecting vulnerable communities from hate and misinformation, a playbook they ran throughout the pandemic.

Don’t aid them in their desire to suppress this story. It belongs in the category of Jerry Sandusky’s crimes and the Ariel Castro saga of kidnapping, rape, and imprisonment in Cleveland, both of which stories attained significant attention in the corporate and tabloid press. This satanic episode in Georgia begs the same degree of grieving and reflection from society. Average people need to speak up without fear for the justice of such victims and for the potential victims of the future.

SCOTUS Cowardice Lets Colorado Keep Persecuting Christians,"Colorado cake artist Jack Phillips is going on 11 years of being harassed by LGBT activists and government authorities for being a practicing Christian.

It was 2012 when Phillips was first hauled before his state’s speech tribunal for telling a gay couple he’d happily sell them anything in his shop but he couldn’t create a custom wedding cake celebrating sexual activities that his religion says are wrong. Last Thursday, Colorado’s Court of Appeals ruled he must bake a transgender celebration cake or face legal consequences beyond the 11 years of legal and social harassment he’s already endured — and counting.

The U.S. Constitution unmistakably protects not only the freedom of speech but also the freedom of Christian worship. The First Amendment, which the Supreme Court holds is now extended beyond Congress to state governments, is extremely clear: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech.”

U.S. governments may not prohibit the free exercise of religion, nor the freedom of speech. On both these counts, Phillips’ rights are clear and ought to be secured by courts.

Instead, however, his natural human rights have been ceaselessly mutilated by not only the entire machinery of Colorado courts but also the U.S. Supreme Court. In 2018, the Supreme Court ruled in Phillips’ favor, yet in such a narrow ruling as to allow a venomous transgender activist to immediately haul him back into court after speciously demanding that Phillips bake a transgender celebration cake.

In 2018, the Supreme Court rebuked the Colorado judicial apparatus for expressing clear animus against Phillips’ Christian beliefs. It did not, however, back the clear First Amendment protections that ought to allow Phillips to worship God peaceably and bake whatever he wants for any reason whatsoever. So Phillips has been made an example by the rapacious LGBT lobby whose end goals are erasing Americans’ free speech and religious exercise rights as well as inserting government meddling into every personal relationship, all marks of totalitarianism.

The Supreme Court allowed this unconstitutional and anti-freedom regime to proliferate while pretending to check it with weak and ineffectual action. The court’s bench, however, has been significantly altered since 2018. And another case is pending before the court that allows it the opportunity to right its 2018 refusal to clearly back free speech and freedom of religious exercise in the United States, in line with the clear wording of the nation’s supreme law, the U.S. Constitution.

That case is 303 Creative v. Elenis, in which another Coloradan has been put on trial for her faith. That case involves a Christian wedding website designer. In oral arguments, Lorie Smith’s legal harassers asserted that ancient Christian beliefs about sex and marriage — which are shared by the world’s other largest and oldest faiths, including Islam and Judaism — are tantamount to racism.

In its rebuke of Colorado’s treatment of Phillips, the 2018 Supreme Court treated the same line of argumentation as “a clear and impermissible hostility toward [Phillips’] sincere religious beliefs.” It’s time for the Supreme Court to rectify its own errors and Colorado’s.

The Supreme Court is designed for more than negotiating grown adults’ nursing of their hurt feelings and telling government entities to stop being mean in public. It is designed to secure the legal protection of Americans’ inalienable natural rights, many of which are enumerated in our supreme law, the Constitution.

Two of those are the freedom of speech and the freedom to peaceably and publicly worship, all without government reprisals. These have been clearly violated for more than a decade by the state of Colorado.

In 2018, the Supreme Court failed to secure these core rights, not only for Jack, but for every one of the millions of Americans who know two men can’t make a baby. Protecting our inalienable rights is the Supreme Court’s one job, yet it again failed in that sacred obligation. Because of that failure, Americans are suffering as the pink police state continues to expand.

Not only should we hope and pray the Supreme Court finally ends the state-sponsored persecution of religious Americans in its decision on 303 Creative v. Elenis, but we should also insist that our representatives refuse to ever vote for any judge at any level who so fundamentally misunderstands the Constitution and the eternal human rights that supreme law protects. Further, no government official should enforce clearly unconstitutional edicts that abridge America’s rights to free speech and freedom of worship and unleash odious harassment on honest, law-abiding Americans who just want to live as their consciences dictate.

It’s not just the Supreme Court’s job to enforce the Constitution. It’s every American’s.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/01/30/supreme-courts-cowardice-allows-colorado-to-keep-persecuting-christians/,2023-01-30
"In Ugly Video, Sam Smith Rips The Mask Off The Trans Agenda","Image Credit SAM SMITH / YouTube

Sam Smith debuted a video last week showcasing the absolute insanity of mainstream transgenderism’s influence on the LGBT movement.

On Friday, the British singer released his latest music video for the track, “I’m Not Here To Make Friends.” The four-minute production is essentially a soft-core remake of “The Phantom of the Opera’s” “Masquerade.” Lest you think Broadway isn’t gay enough already, by today’s left-wing LGBT standards, it isn’t.

In 2019, Smith declared himself “non-binary” — in other words, a person who believes he was born a third sex or above the sexes altogether. The British pop star has been documenting his apparent transition on social media.

[READ: Masculinity Isn’t Toxic, Our Erasure Of It Is]

The debut of Smith’s latest music video offers fans a graphic depiction of his identity crisis, with the singer fleshing out his sexual fantasies on screen in a display of the kind of radical transgenderism that’s taken over the LGBT movement. The gaudy, risqué performances are presented with the flair of “Phantom’s” early-20th-century mansion masquerade ball — except, of course, Broadway has taste.

The gay movement purported to be about equality and tolerance, with homosexuals, for the most part, saying they wanted to be left alone to marry whom they wanted. After the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision, transgenderism hijacked the movement and persuaded a portion of lesbians and gays such as Smith, people who’ve been uncomfortable with sex norms, that so-called “gender” was the problem. Gays often get co-opted into going along with the propaganda out of peer intimidation, devoid of any real conviction.

Smith’s video highlights the radical normalization of “kinks” that’s gone from the fringes to taxpayer-sponsored drag queen story hours and even drag queen strip performances for children.

Smith isn’t the face of gay men, except those gay men now struggling to reconcile transgender propaganda with same-sex attraction. It’s no longer the straights demanding gay men have sex with women anymore — it’s the transgender movement.

Media Give All Faithful Christians The Tony Dungy Treatment,"More than a week after appearing at the annual March for Life in Washington, D.C., former football coach and NBC Sports analyst Tony Dungy was still taking heat from the corporate media for not only his pro-life views but for his criticism of some of the more disturbing trends in contemporary culture.

NBC Out, the LGBT section of NBC News, accused Dungy of spreading a “transphobic myth” regarding students who identify as cats and did an investigative deep dive into his former tweets, accusing him of having “anti-LGBTQ history.” This included, among other things, tweets “critical of same-sex marriage, homosexuality and the LGBTQ ‘lifestyle.’”

Dungy’s employer wasn’t the only voice attacking him for expressing his Christian beliefs. The pile-on has come from many corners of leftist corporate media, including folks from CNN, The Washington Post, MSN, and The Nation, among others. What this media circus represents, at its core, is an arresting, if increasingly obvious, truth: The corporate media want to silence Christians from speaking out about their faith in the public square.

Media Reveal Their Hatred for Christianity

The latest dust-up over Dungy was tied to his willingness to speak out against abortion at the March for Life. ESPN panelist and Washington Post columnist Kevin Blackistone accused Dungy of being “regressive and intolerant” and of being associated with “zealots.” (That’s a bit risible, given that Blackistone called the national anthem a “war anthem” and uses his WaPo column to relentlessly push radical racial ideologies.) Blackistone further ominously warned Dungy that appearing at an upcoming evangelical men’s conference in March “could be hazardous to his career.”

Threats against Dungy’s career as co-host of NBC’s “Football Night in America” have come from other sources, too. As The Federalist reported on Jan. 23, journalist Keith Olbermann tweeted: “Dear @nbcsports – if you have any remaining concern for your operational reputation, fire Tony Dungy now. He is using you.” Dave Zirin, sports editor at The Nation, in turn, accused Dungy of being a “right-wing zealot” and “anti-gay bigot.” The “anti-gay” slander stems from a tweet Dungy posted about a discredited claim that schools would provide litter boxes to kids identifying as cats (still, even if that’s not true, let’s admit that schools indulging kids who identify as animals is ridiculous, stupid, and shameful).

Yet, in even further evidence of the media’s disdain for outspoken Christians, many pundits have exploited the occasion to further attack him over his religious beliefs as they relate to sexuality. An article published by MSN accused Dungy of being “cruel” and “anti-LGBT” and said that “what Dungy shared was not an effective apology. Not even close.” An op-ed at USA Today claimed Dungy was guilty of “bigotry” and “ignorance” and implied he was responsible for poor mental health and suicidal ideation among LGBT youth. Another op-ed at U.S. News & World Report likewise slandered Dungy as a bigot and asserted that “no network should give him a voice.”

Part of a Broader Campaign to Silence Christians

Though the media’s treatment of Dungy is contemptible, it is by no means unusual. Any Christian celebrity who publicly shares his or her beliefs regarding what the Bible teaches about life or sexuality risks censure. The list of Christian celebrities in sports who have been targeted for their pro-life opinions includes Steph Curry, Joe Burrow, Tim Tebow, and Jim Harbaugh.

And when it comes to the Bible’s teachings on sexuality, former pitcher Curt Schilling was fired by ESPN for his Christian views on transgenderism. The list of athletes forced to apologize for “homophobic” or “transphobic” social media posts — or even liking such posts — includes Lamar Jackson, Trea Turner, Kyler Murray, and Rudy Gobert, among many others. Pro-LGBT websites invested untold hours digging into the social media profiles of athletes to uncover suspected anti-LGBT posts going back to grade school. One fan took the trouble to find 75 such “homophobic” tweets by more than 40 athletes between 2009 and 2013.

Granted, some of the above individuals were not necessarily attacked because they were espousing beliefs stemming from their Christian faith. But the point remains that any celebrity who publicly declares their opposition to abortion, gay marriage, or transgenderism risks backlash, cancellation, and even loss of employment. It is no exaggeration to say that being a prominent Christian in sports or the entertainment industry comes with tremendous dangers.

Pray for the Dungys of America

Anyone who has been paying attention over the last couple of decades should already be somewhat aware of what I described above. We know that the only Christian celebrities allowed to publicly discuss their faith are those whose beliefs align with the latest manifestation of the Democratic Party’s talking points. If your version of Christianity happens to believe abortion is an objective good or any manner of sexual behavior or so-called gender identity is to be celebrated, preach away!

Yet for those still holding to orthodox, historic Christian teachings on such matters, there are little means of escape if you make those beliefs publicly known. For that reason, the Tony Dungys of the world require our prayers. He has taken an admirable, impressive stance that very well may mean the end of his professional career. Others like him have already paid the price. Those remaining will need the grace of the Holy Spirit to persevere in the face of such powerful opposition. And those quiet faithful flying under the radar need our prayers, too, so that they might find the courage (and prudence) to state uncomfortable, unpopular truths when Christ calls them to it.

For it seems inevitable in this cultural climate that they will all eventually be called upon to decide whether the adulation of the crowd or Christ matters most.

Kids' Disinterest In Libraries Isn't Because Of A Manga Shortage,"Poor little Johnny. He would have become a lifelong reader, scaling the heights of Shakespeare and Dostoyevsky. But no. His local school library didn’t have any more graphic novels or manga for him to read. So he lost interest in the printed word. Now he bags groceries for a living.

Such a story might sound patently ridiculous, but that’s exactly what the leftist corporate media want you to think about recent changes in our nation’s libraries. “Schools are struggling to keep their shelves stocked as oversight by parents and school boards intensifies,” says a recent front-page article in The Washington Post. Author Hannah Natanson claims that libraries in Florida, Pennsylvania, Texas, and elsewhere are purchasing thousands fewer books, and those innocent students — all of them voracious readers in training — are caught in the middle.

Indeed, if legacy media are to be believed, America is facing a plague of censorship that is soon to rival that described in “Fahrenheit 451.”

“As Book Bans Soar, Students Are Joining the Fight Against Censorship,” declared a Connecticut NBC affiliate. “Facing pressure to ban books, suburban libraries’ becoming a battlefield for the First Amendment,’” reported the Chicago Sun-Times. “Let libraries be libraries, without political meddling,” urged the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

Yet scratch the surface of this scaremongering narrative, and you’ll perceive that these claims are not only overblown but deeply misrepresentative of broader trends regarding children’s literacy in the United States.

Do Anime And Manga Inspire More Reading?

“Hurdles to book ordering have emerged across the country,” reported WaPo. It cites a school librarian in Florida’s Monroe County who has not been allowed to purchase books since last year, who said that her district had seen decreased student interest in and demand for books. Circulation is down “dramatically,” she claimed while providing WaPo with a list of books requested by students that she has not been able to order. The list includes, among other titles, “Dragon Ball, “Dragon Ball Z,” “Pokemon Adventures,” and a long list of various Japanese neo-noir science fiction anime and manga such as “Cowboy Bebop” and “Zom 100.”

The report also quotes John Chrastka, head of the library political action committee EveryLibrary, who warned that hindering librarians’ ability to purchase books would dampen students’ enthusiasm for reading. “We know very clearly from the research that a key driver for individual reading success is self-directed reading when kids pick up a fun new book that interests them.” Brooklyn school librarian Ciro Scardina warned: “No one is going to want to visit the library.”

Forgive me if I’m a bit skeptical that students today demanding anime and manga are tomorrow’s readers of Faulkner, Austen, or Shakespeare. As much as experts say comics can serve as a gateway to more complex reading, the data does not look good: The percentage of adult Americans reading literature has been declining for decades, as has general book reading across all ages and education levels. “Kids’ reading rates have been plummeting for years. … The data goes back many years,” says Mark Bauerlein, author of “The Dumbest Generation” and “The Dumbest Generation Grows Up” and emeritus professor of literature at Emory.

“They don’t move from Pokemon to great literature,” he says. “They go from Pokemon to cartoons and video games, the visual. They want pictures; they’re not going to like pages that are all print.”

Moreover, pace Scardina’s warning, no one has been visiting libraries for decades. Only 7 percent of Americans visit a library weekly, while almost 60 percent seldom or never visit their local public library. Use of libraries in America has declined by about a third in just the last decade. This is unsurprising, given the general decline of American readers.

Libraries Are Proud Purveyors of Leftism

Warnings of increased oversight of our nation’s libraries also elide the well-documented fact that libraries are now bastions of leftist ideology. “Librarians are all left-wingers. You’ve got a lot of purple-haired cat women,” observes Bauerlein.

James Panero, executive editor of the New Criterion, has bemoaned the politicization of American libraries by librarians and local officials, turning them into engines of social justice praxis and removing thousands of books and stacks in favor of computer areas and meeting rooms for community space. In 2021 the American Library Association (ALA) published its “Resolution to Condemn White Supremacy and Fascism as Antithetical to Library Work,” claiming that “libraries have upheld and encouraged white supremacy both actively through discriminatory practices and passively through a misplaced emphasis on neutrality.”

Every June, my local library, one of many in Fairfax County, pulls out all the stops to celebrate Pride Month. Guess how many copies of Abigail Shrier’s best-selling “Irreversible Damage,” which discusses the damage of transgenderism to young girls, the entire library system possesses. One, in Spanish. There are only five copies of Ryan T. Anderson’s “When Harry Became Sally,” also about transgenderism. There are, by comparison, 16 copies of “Gender Queer,” and 17 copies of “Lawn Boy,” two highly controversial LGBT books for adolescents.

Moreover, the ALA puts out local packages for local public libraries for how to organize and market drag queen story hours. As I cataloged in a recent piece for The Federalist, this politicization often happens despite protests from local residents.

Tech Addiction, Curriculum Are Real Culprits

The decline in young readers is indeed a sad story, but the blame does not lie with parents and school boards exerting more oversight over radical ideologues with library science degrees. The trend has a much older origin. Bauerlein notes that part of the problem comes from technological addiction stemming from cell phone use, but also the curricular deterioration of literature in junior school and high school. He adds, citing his recent piece in American Greatness:

The curriculum has gone into media, media literacy, critical thinking schools; the old canon of literature, all those dead white males, that’s out. You’re telling them that literature is not that important. We just want you to have good reading comprehension skills … And, one of the sad things is that English teachers are not that well read.

Libraries, like other once-venerable institutions of American civilization, such as the news media and the academy, have become intolerant, leftist echo chambers. That librarians are proposing that lack of access to anime and manga is to blame for declining literacy shows how delusional they have become.

Bauerlein asks, “Is the argument for LGBTQ stuff in the schools so feeble that you have to invent this notion that ‘well if Pokemon is not there, the kids won’t read.’ Are you that desperate for proof or evidence that you can make such a ridiculous and flimsy rationale?” Apparently, leftists are.

"The Grammys' Embrace Of Satanism Isn't Just Gross, It's Boring","Hollywood’s not-so-secret LGBT agenda was on full display at the Grammys last night. From the eyesore that was Harry Styles’ “clowncore” jumpsuit; to Beyonce dedicating her win to her guncle and the “queer community” (of which she is not a part); to Kim Petras narcissistically crowning himself the first transgender “woman” to win in the Best Pop Duo/Group category, the only way viewers could escape the gay was if they turned off their TVs.

For those who powered through the ceremony, they would have also been subjected to the unsightly and openly satanic performance of “Unholy” by Petras and Sam Smith, who calls himself “nonbinary.” While Petras danced around in a cage surrounded by she-devils (or they-devils?), a latex and high heel-clad Smith led a group of witchy women in a dance clearly intended to mimic devil worship. That Madonna — a woman who looks less human and more diabolic than ever thanks to some gnarly plastic surgery — introduced the performance is fitting.

In her introduction, Madonna smugly alluded to the “controversy” that would soon occur on stage. Though the performance was certainly as depraved, tasteless, and oversexed as the lyrics to the sinful “Unholy” might call for, my main complaint is not that Smith, a gay man, and Petras, a man who purports to be a woman, were flaunting Satanism and anti-family values on live television.

My main complaint is just how boring, unoriginal, and self-congratulatory the performance was.

These days, full-fledged embrace of Satanism and sado-masochism is nothing new or out of the ordinary for Hollywood. Anything that was going to come after Lil Nas X’s “MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name)” music video, featuring a lap dance with the devil, and accompanying Satan shoes would be hard to top. Even so, Hollywood’s pop and hip-hop darlings continue to seize on satanic imagery for their lyrics, performances, and promotional materials as often as they adopt new gender identities or advocate to normalize transgenderism.

But is it just me or is the shtick getting old?

When I watch a performance such as the one described above, I instinctively know that it was both made and not made for someone like me. The twisted minds behind the Grammys want to induce shock and outrage. They revel in any disgust they can produce in conservative and God-fearing viewers, myself included. In the way that this performance was crafted to provoke conservative, churchgoing Americans, it was actually tailor-made for me.

On the other hand, such a flagrant celebration of Satanism, adultery, and LGBT “values” could only gain such a thunderous round of applause at an event like the Grammys — an event filled with a populace so out-of-touch and enslaved to the LGBT agenda and its hatred of God and beauty that they wouldn’t know good art if it slapped them in the face, Will Smith style.

Petras and Smith’s performance, and Hollywood award ceremonies more broadly, are occasions meant to draw crude political lines. If you found the performance distasteful, you are a hateful bigot. If you thought that the performance was a brilliantly subversive triumph for two rich and famous members of the oppressed classes (gay and trans), then you are open-minded and on the right side of history.

So instead of taking the bait, instead of clutching our pearls and (rightfully) condemning the abominations on our TV screens, what if we just called out Hollywood for making bad and boring art?

If you can get past the hypersexed and satanic elements of today’s popular music, you will soon realize that the music itself is objectively bad. It’s boring, trite, and desperate, so embarrassingly eager to shock that it ends up talking about the same few topics (drugs, sex, money) in increasingly debased yet unimaginative and unintelligent ways.

Of course I felt disgusted seeing Sam Smith stuffed in latex like a sausage and singing about adultery. But in no way was I surprised that yet another pop singer thought it would be cool and edgy to promote Satanism. My boredom with Hollywood has officially become stronger than my disgust.

We should not dismiss the open embrace of Satanism and anti-family values in Hollywood. We should continue to denounce it. But in addition to clutching our pearls, we should use our outrage as fuel to create genuinely beautiful art. And I’m not talking about art as thinly veiled political manifestos. I’m talking about art that honors the human spirit and gets at what it means to be a creature made by God, called to partake in both the joy and suffering that comes along with being made in his image.

Dante, Michelangelo, C.S. Lewis — these artists created for the greater glory of God, and think about what wonderful feats they were able to accomplish. Feats that speak to all of humanity, not just the oppressed few.

The call for conservatives to make their own art has been strong and steady in recent years. Many have responded and are doing great work. But we need to ramp up our efforts because this much is clear: Hollywood is full of uncreative, boring clowns.

What will we leave behind for posterity?
